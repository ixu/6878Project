SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Drosophila Mad is required for signaling by the TGF-beta (e.g.,
190180)-related factor decapentaplegic. Zhang et al. (1996) cloned a
human cDNA encoding MADH3, a homolog of Drosophila Mad. The deduced
425-amino acid MADH3 protein (GenBank GENBANK 2522267) is 92% identical
to MADH2 (601366).

By searching an expressed sequence tag database with the protein
sequences of Mad and Mad homologs, Riggins et al. (1996) isolated human
cDNAs encoding MADH3, which they called JV15-2. The C terminus of MADH3
shows significant homology to that of Drosophila Mad.

GENE STRUCTURE

Arai et al. (1998) determined the genomic structure of SMAD3, which
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) mapped the MADH3 gene to 15q21-q22 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and screening of YAC clones.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (1996) showed that MADH3 and MADH4 (SMAD4; 600993)
synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-beta-like responses.
MADH3 containing a C-terminal truncation acted as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the normal TGF-beta response. The activity of MADH3 was
regulated by the TGF-beta receptors (e.g., 190181), and MADH3 was
phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex.
Zhang et al. (1996) stated that these results define MADH3 as an
effector of the TGF-beta response.

Zawel et al. (1998) found that human SMAD3 and SMAD4 proteins could
specifically recognize an identical 8-bp palindromic sequence
(GTCTAGAC). Tandem repeats of this palindrome conferred striking
TGF-beta responsiveness to a minimal promoter. This responsiveness was
abrogated by targeted deletion of the cellular SMAD4 gene. These results
showed that SMAD proteins are involved in the biologic responses to
TGF-beta and related ligands.

Scleroderma is a chronic systemic disease that leads to fibrosis of the
skin and other affected organs. TGFB has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of scleroderma. SMAD proteins function as signaling
transducers downstream from TGFB receptors. Dong et al. (2002)
investigated the signaling components of the TGFB pathway and TGFB
activity in scleroderma lesions in vivo and in scleroderma fibroblasts
in vitro. Basal level and TGFB-inducible expression of SMAD7 (602932)
were selectively decreased, whereas SMAD3 expression was increased both
in scleroderma skin and in explanted scleroderma fibroblasts in culture.
TGFB signaling events were increased in scleroderma fibroblasts relative
to normal fibroblasts. In vitro adenoviral gene transfer with SMAD7
restored normal TGFB signaling in scleroderma fibroblasts. These results
suggested that alterations in the SMAD pathway, including marked SMAD7
deficiency and SMAD3 upregulation, may be responsible for TGFB
hyperresponsiveness observed in scleroderma.

You and Kruse (2002) studied corneal myofibroblast differentiation and
signal transduction induced by the TGFB family members activin A
(147290) and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7; 112267). They found
that activin A induced phosphorylation of SMAD2 (601366), and BMP7
induced SMAD1 (601595), both of which were inhibited by follistatin
(136470). Transfection with antisense SMAD2/SMAD3 prevented
activin-induced expression and accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle
actin. The authors concluded that TGFB proteins have different functions
in the cornea. Activin A and TGFB1, but not BMP7, are regulators of
keratocyte differentiation and might play a role during myofibroblast
transdifferentiation. SMAD2/SMAD3 signal transduction appeared to be
important in the regulation of muscle-specific genes.

SMAD3 is a direct mediator of transcriptional activation by the TGF-beta
receptor. Its target genes in epithelial cells include cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK; see 116953) inhibitors that generate a cytostatic response.
Chen et al. (2002) defined how, in the same context, SMAD3 can mediate
transcriptional repression of the growth-promoting gene MYC (190080). A
complex containing SMAD3, the transcription factors E2F4 (600659), E2F5
(600967), and DP1 (189902), and the corepressor p107 (116957) preexists
in the cytoplasm. In response to TGF-beta, this complex moves into the
nucleus and associates with SMAD4, recognizing a composite SMAD-E2F site
on MYC for repression. Previously known as the ultimate recipients of
CDK regulatory signals, E2F4/E2F5 and p107 act here as transducers of
TGF-beta receptor signals upstream of CDK. SMAD proteins therefore
mediate transcriptional activation or repression depending on their
associated partners.

TGFB (190180) stimulation leads to phosphorylation and activation of
SMAD2 and SMAD3, which form complexes with SMAD4 that accumulate in the
nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes. Inman et al. (2002)
demonstrated that following TGFB stimulation of epithelial cells,
receptors remain active for at least 3 to 4 hours, and continuous
receptor activity is required to maintain active SMADs in the nucleus
and for TGFB-induced transcription. Continuous nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of the SMADs during active TGFB signaling provides the
mechanism whereby the intracellular transducers of the signal
continuously monitor receptor activity. These data explain how, at all
times, the concentration of active SMADs in the nucleus is directly
dictated by the levels of activated receptors in the cytoplasm.

Based upon molecular allelotyping and comparative genomic hybridization
studies, chromosome 15q is the likely location of a tumor suppressor
gene important in the pathogeneses of sporadic enteropancreatic
endocrine tumors and parathyroid adenomas. To determine whether SMAD3
plays a primary role in the development of these tumors, Shattuck et al.
(2002) investigated 20 enteropancreatic tumors and 67 parathyroid
adenomas for LOH at DNA markers surrounding SMAD3. Twenty percent of
enteropancreatic tumors and 24% of parathyroid adenomas showed loss. All
9 coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of the SMAD3 gene were then
sequenced in genomic DNA from all 20 enteropancreatic and 25 parathyroid
tumors, including every case with LOH. No acquired clonal mutations,
insertions, or microdeletions in SMAD3 were detected in any tumors.
Because inactivating somatic mutation is the hallmark of an authentic
tumor suppressor, SMAD3 is unlikely to function as a classic tumor
suppressor gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic parathyroid or
enteropancreatic endocrine tumors.

Matsuura et al. (2004) showed that SMAD3 is a major physiologic
substrate of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 (123829) and CDK2
(116953). Except for the retinoblastoma protein family, SMAD3 was the
only CDK4 substrate demonstrated to that time. Matsuura et al. (2004)
mapped CDK4 and CDK2 phosphorylation sites to thr8, thr178, and ser212
in SMAD3. Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites increased Smad3
transcriptional activity, leading to higher expression of the CDK
inhibitor p15 (600431). Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites of
Smad3 also increased its ability to downregulate the expression of
c-myc. Using Smad3 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts and other
epithelial cell lines, Matsuura et al. (2004) further showed that Smad3
inhibits cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and that mutation of
the CDK phosphorylation sites in Smad3 increases this ability. They
concluded that CDK phosphorylation of SMAD3 inhibits its transcriptional
activity and antiproliferative function.

To determine the role of SMAD3 in the pathogenesis of lymphoid
neoplasia, Wolfraim et al. (2004) measured SMAD3 mRNA and protein in
leukemia cells obtained at diagnosis from 19 children with acute
leukemia: 10 with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 7 with
pre-B-cell ALL, and 2 with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). SMAD3
protein was absent in T-cell ALL but present in pre-B-cell ALL and ANLL.
No mutations in the SMAD3 gene were identified in T-cell ALL, and SMAD3
mRNA was present in T-cell ALL and normal T cells at similar levels.
Wolfraim et al. (2004) concluded that loss of SMAD3 protein is a
specific feature of pediatric T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.

Gupta et al. (2006) retracted their paper describing the identification
of a microRNA in the latency-associated transcript (Lat) of herpes
simplex virus (HSV)-1 (miR-Lat) that targets TGFB and SMAD3 via
sequences in their 3-prime UTRs that show partial homology to miR-Lat.

In experiments using mouse muscle, Carlson et al. (2008) found that, in
addition to the loss of Notch (190198) activation, old muscle produces
excessive TGF-beta (but not myostatin, 601788), which induces unusually
high levels of Smad3 in resident satellite cells and interferes with the
regenerative capacity. Importantly, endogenous Notch and Smad3
antagonize each other in the control of satellite cell proliferation,
such that activation of Notch blocks the TGF-beta-dependent upregulation
of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16 (600160), p21
(116899), and p27 (600778), whereas inhibition of Notch induces them.
Furthermore, in muscle stem cells, Notch activity determined the binding
of Smad3 to the promoters of these negative regulators of cell cycle
progression. Attenuation of TGF-beta/Smad3 in old, injured muscle
restored regeneration to satellite cells in vivo. Thus, a balance
between endogenous Smad3 and active Notch controls the regenerative
competence of muscle stem cells, and deregulation of this balance in the
old muscle microniche interferes with regeneration.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs (see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates
PDCD4 (608610), which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth
muscle contractile genes. Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signaling
promoted a rapid increase in expression of mature miR21 through a
posttranscriptional step, promoting the processing of primary
transcripts of miR21 (pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the
Drosha complex (see 608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal
transducers SMAD1 (601595), SMAD2 (601366), SMAD3, and SMAD5 (603110)
are recruited to pri-miR21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5;
180630), a component of the Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared
cofactor SMAD4 (600993) is not required for this process. Thus, Davis et
al. (2008) concluded that regulation of microRNA biogenesis by
ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular
smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent
responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways.

Chuderland et al. (2008) identified an SPS motif in ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948)
and SMAD3 and a similar TPT motif in MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872) that directed
protein nuclear accumulation when phosphorylated.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using cDNA, Roth et al. (2000) conducted mutation analysis of the SMAD2,
SMAD3, and SMAD4 genes in 14 Finnish kindreds with hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer (see 120435). They found no mutations.

In a 4-generation Dutch family with arterial aneurysms and dissections
and early-onset osteoarthritis mapping to chromosome 15q22.2-q24.2, van
de Laar et al. (2011) analyzed the candidate gene SMAD3 and identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation (R287W; 603109.0001) that
segregated with disease. The authors designated the disorder
aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (AOS), but it is here incorporated
into the Loeys-Dietz phenotypic series as Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 3
(LDS3; 613795). Analysis of SMAD3 in 99 patients with thoracic aortic
aneurysms and dissections and Marfan-like features, who were known to be
negative for mutation in the FBN1 (134797), TGFBR1 (190181), and TGFBR2
(190182) genes, revealed 2 additional probands with heterozygous SMAD3
mutations (603109.0002; 603109.0003). All 3 mutations were located in
the MH2 domain, which mediates oligomerization of SMAD3 with SMAD4
(600993) and SMAD-dependent transcriptional activation.

Regalado et al. (2011) reported 4 new mutations in SMAD3. One mutation
(603109.0004) was a frameshift mutation in exon 5 segregating in a
family with LDS3 phenotype. The other 3 were missense mutations in
invariant codons.

Van de Laar et al. (2012) identified 5 novel SMAD3 mutations in 5
additional families with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (see, e.g.,
603109.0008-603109.0010).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhu et al. (1998) reported the targeted disruption of the mouse Smad3
gene. Smad3 mutant mice were viable and fertile. Between 4 and 6 months
of age, the Smad3 mutant mice became moribund with colorectal
adenocarcinomas. The neoplasms penetrated through the intestinal wall
and metastasized to lymph nodes. Since TGF-beta transduces its signal to
the interior of the cell via Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, these results
directly implicate TGF-beta signaling in the pathogenesis of colorectal
cancer and provide a compelling animal model for the study of human
colorectal cancer.

Yang et al. (1999) found that Smad3-null (ex8/ex8) mice died between 1
and 8 months due to a primary defect in immune function. The mice
exhibited inflammatory lesions in a number of organs, including the
nasal mucosa, stomach, pancreas, colon, and small intestine, as well as
enlarged lymph nodes, an involuted thymus, and the formation of
bacterial abscesses adjacent to mucosal surfaces. Immunostaining
revealed a significant increase in T-cell activation, suggesting that
Smad3 has a role in TGFB-mediated regulation of T-cell activation.

Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a chronic inflammatory condition in
which renal fibrosis is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal
transition of the renal tubules and synthesis of extracellular matrix in
response to multiple entities, including ureteral obstruction. TGFB
plays a pivotal role in the disease process. Sato et al. (2003) found
that Smad3-null mice with ureteral obstruction were protected against
tubulointerstitial fibrosis, presumably by blocking the downstream
effects of TGFB. Levels of TGFB mRNA and mature protein were decreased
in the mutant animals compared to experimental controls, indicating that
the Smad3 pathway is also essential for autoinduction of TGFB.

Wolfraim et al. (2004) used mice in which 1 or both alleles of Smad3
were inactivated to evaluate the role of Smad3 in the response of normal
T cells to TGF-beta and in the susceptibility to spontaneous
leukemogenesis in mice in which both alleles of the tumor suppressor
p27(Kip1) (CDKN1B; 600778) were deleted. The loss of 1 allele for Smad3
impaired the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta on the proliferation of
normal T cells and worked in tandem with the homozygous inactivation of
p27(Kip1) to promote T-cell leukemogenesis. Wolfraim et al. (2004)
concluded that a reduction in Smad3 expression and the loss of p27(Kip1)
work synergistically to promote T-cell leukemogenesis in mice.

Ashcroft et al. (1999) generated Smad3-null mice and observed
accelerated cutaneous wound healing, with complete reepithelialization
by day 2 compared to day 5 in wildtype mice, and significantly reduced
local infiltration of monocytes. Smad3 -/- keratinocytes showed altered
patterns of growth and migration, and Smad3 -/- monocytes exhibited a
selectively blunted chemotactic response to TGF-beta (190180).

Arany et al. (2006) created excisional ear wounds in Smad3 -/- mice and
observed wound enlargement compared to wildtype controls. Levels of
elastin and glycosaminoglycans were increased, collagen fibers were more
compactly organized, and integrins, TGFB1, and matrix metalloproteinases
were altered both basally and after wounding in Smad3-knockout mice.
Mechanical testing revealed an increased modulus of elasticity,
suggesting an imbalance of tissue forces. Arany et al. (2006) proposed
that the altered mechanical elastic properties lead to a persistent
retractile force that is opposed by decreased wound contractile forces.

Kanamaru et al. (2005) found that bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs)
from Smad3-null mice had an augmented capacity to produce
proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Mast
cell-deficient mice reconstituted with Smad3-null BMMCs survived
significantly longer in an acute peritonitis model than mast
cell-deficient mice reconstituted with wildtype BMMCs. Kanamaru et al.
(2005) proposed that SMAD3 in mast cells inhibits mast cell-mediated
immune responses against gram-negative bacteria.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ARG287TRP

In 20 affected members of a 4-generation Dutch family with arterial
aneurysms and dissections and early-onset osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795),
van de Laar et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for an 859C-T
transition in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in an arg287-to-trp
(R287W) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the MH2
domain. The mutation was not found in 7 unaffected family members or in
544 Dutch control chromosomes. Immunohistochemical analysis of aortic
wall tissue from 2 patients showed increased expression of key proteins
in the TGF-beta (see TGFB1, 190180) pathway.

.0002
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 2-BP DEL, 741AT

In 3 Dutch sibs with arterial aneurysms and dissections and early-onset
osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (741delAT) in exon 6 of the SMAD3
gene, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination sequence at
codon 309 in exon 7 that removes nearly the complete MH2 domain
(Thr247ProfsX61). The deletion, which was presumably present in their
affected deceased father, was not found in their unaffected mother or in
544 Dutch control chromosomes. Analysis of patient cDNA showed very weak
mutant signal compared to wildtype, and treatment of patient fibroblast
cultures with cycloheximide markedly increased the mutant signal,
indicating that most of the abnormal RNA was subjected to nonsense
messenger RNA decay and that a truncated SMAD3 protein was barely
formed.

.0003
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, THR261ILE

In a Dutch male patient with arterial aneurysm and early-onset
osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 783C-T transition in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene,
resulting in a thr261-to-ile (T261I) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the MH2 domain. The mutation was not found in 544 Dutch
control chromosomes.

.0004
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 1-BP DEL, 652A

In a 3-generation pedigree segregating autosomal dominant thoracic
aortic aneurysms and dissections with intracranial and other arterial
aneurysms (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al. (2011) identified a deletion
of an A at nucleotide 652 in exon 5 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in
frameshift leading to premature termination following asparagine-218
(N218fs). This mutation was present in all individuals with vascular
disease in the family and segregated with a lod score of 2.52. The
pedigree had originally been reported by Regalado et al. (2011). The
mutation was absent from 2,300 control exomes.

.0005
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ARG279LYS

In 2 unrelated families of European descent with autosomal dominant
thoracic aortic and other aneurysms (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al.
(2011) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 836 in exon 6 of the
SMAD3 gene, resulting in an arg-to-lys substitution at codon 279
(R279K). Arg279 is completely conserved from human to Drosophila, and
the R279K mutation was predicted to disrupt protein function. The
mutation was not identified in 2,300 control exomes. There was decreased
penetrance in younger family members.

.0006
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, GLU239LYS

In a small family with 3 sibs affected with thoracic aortic aneurysm and
dissection (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al. (2011) identified a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 715 in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in a
glutamine-to-lysine substitution at codon 239 (E239K). Exon 6 encodes
the MH2 protein-protein binding domain. Glu239 is completely conserved
from human to Drosophila, and the E239K mutation was predicted to
disrupt protein function. The mutation was not identified in 2,300
control exomes.

.0007
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ALA112VAL

In a family segregating autosomal dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm with
dissection as well as other features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS3;
613795) including bifid uvula and scoliosis, and early-onset
osteoarthritis, Regalado et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
alanine-to-valine substitution at codon 112 (A112V). The mutation
segregated with disease with reduced penetrance in this family and was
not identified in 2,300 control exomes. Guo (2012) stated that the
correct nucleotide change for the A112V mutation is 335C-T in exon 2
rather than 235C-T as cited in Regalado et al. (2011).

.0008
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 1-BP DEL, 313G

In a patient with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van
de Laar et al. (2012) identified a 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 313 of
the SMAD3 gene (313delG), resulting in a frameshift (ala105profsX11).

.0009
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, PRO263LEU

In a patient with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van
de Laar et al. (2012) identified a 788C-T transition in the SMAD3 gene,
resulting in a pro263-to-leu (P263L) substitution.

.0010
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, GLU361TER

In affected members of a family segregating aneurysms-osteoarthritis
syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2012) identified a 1-bp
duplication at nucleotide 1080 in the SMAD3 gene (1080dupT), resulting
in a glu361-to-ter (E361X) substitution.

600169	TITLE *600169 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX CLASS I CHAIN-RELATED GENE A; MICA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes typically encode
polymorphic peptide-binding chains that are ubiquitously expressed and
mediate the recognition of intracellular antigens by cytotoxic T cells.
Motivated by the association of HLA-B27 with rheumatoid and inflammatory
diseases, Bahram et al. (1994) found a family of sequences in the human
MHC that are highly divergent from all of the known MHC class I genes
and were presumably derived early in the evolution of mammalian class I
genes. These MIC genes (for MHC class I chain-related genes) evolved in
parallel with the human class I genes and with those of most, if not
all, mammalian orders. Bahram et al. (1994) cloned the MICA gene in this
family and stated that it was by far the most divergent mammalian MHC
class I gene known. The MICA gene encodes a 383-amino acid polypeptide
with a predicted mass of 43 kD. It is further distinguished by its
unusual exon-intron organization and preferential expression in
fibroblasts and epithelial cells. However, the presence of distinctive
residues in the MICA amino acid sequence translated from cDNA suggested
that the putative MICA chain folds similarly to typical class I chains
and may have the capacity to bind peptide or other short ligands. Thus,
a second lineage of evolutionarily conserved MHC class I genes was
defined by these results. MICA and other members of this family may have
been selected for specialized functions that are either ancient or
derived from those of typical MHC class I genes, in analogy to some of
the nonclassic mouse H-2 genes.

MAPPING

Bahram et al. (1994) demonstrated that the MICA gene is located near
HLA-B (142830) on chromosome 6. Nalabolu et al. (1996) showed that the
MICA and MICB (602436) genes occur in a 200-kb region spanning the TNFA
(191160) and TNFB (153440) cluster at chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

T cells with variable region V-delta-1 gamma/delta T-cell receptors (see
TCRG, 186970, and TCRD, 186810) are distributed throughout the human
intestinal epithelium and may function as sentinels that respond to self
antigens. The expression of MICA matches this localization. Groh et al.
(1998) found that MICA and the closely related MICB were recognized by
intestinal epithelial T cells expressing diverse V-delta-1 gamma/delta
TCRs. These interactions involved the alpha-1/alpha-2 domains of MICA
and MICB but were independent of antigen processing. With intestinal
epithelial cell lines, the expression and recognition of MICA and MICB
could be stress induced. Thus, these molecules may broadly regulate
protective responses by the V-delta-1 gamma/delta T cells in the
epithelium of the intestinal tract.

Bauer et al. (1999) found that MICA binds NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) on
gamma/delta T cells, CD8+ alpha/beta T cells, and natural killer (NK)
cells. Engagement of NKG2D activated cytolytic responses of gamma/delta
T cells and NK cells against transfectants and epithelial tumor cells
expressing MICA. These results defined an activating immunoreceptor-MHC
ligand interaction that may promote antitumor NK- and T-cell responses.

MIC engagement of NKG2D stimulates NK-cell and T-cell effector
functions. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection induces the expression of
stress proteins such as HSP70 (140550). By flow cytometric analysis,
Groh et al. (2001) showed that CMV infection also induces MIC expression
and a concurrent downregulation of MHC class I molecules on fibroblasts
and endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections
from patients with CMV interstitial pneumonitis confirmed that induction
of MIC expression also occurs in vivo. Functional analysis of T-cell
cytotoxicity against CMV-infected fibroblasts showed that early after
infection when MIC expression was low, antibodies to MHC class I, but
not to MIC or NKG2D, could block T cell-mediated cytolysis. As MIC
expression increased, antibody masking of MIC or NKG2D reduced target
cell lysis; anti-MHC class I antibodies further reduced cytolysis. The
presence of MICA on stimulator cells also substantially enhanced
cytokine release by T-cell clones, and anti-MIC antibody abrogated this
production, suggesting that the MIC-NKG2D interaction provides an
important costimulatory activity.

Groh et al. (2002) showed that NKG2D binding of MIC induces endocytosis
and degradation of NKG2D. In cancer patients, NKG2D expression was
markedly reduced in both CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells and in
peripheral blood T cells, associated with circulating tumor-derived
soluble MICA. The downregulation of NKG2D causes a severe impairment of
tumor antigen-specific effector T cells. Groh et al. (2002) proposed
that this mode of T cell silencing through MIC shedding may promote
tumor immune evasion and inferred that it could also compromise host
resistance to infections.

Using immunohistopathologic and flow cytometric analyses, Hue et al.
(2004) found increased expression of MICA at epithelial cell surfaces in
celiac disease (CD; 212750) patients exposed to gliadin. Patient biopsy
specimens exposed to an IL15 (600554)-inducing gliadin fragment did not
express MICA in the presence of anti-IL15. Cytotoxicity assays showed
that NKG2D played primarily a costimulatory role on intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs), with a TCR-mediated signal required for complete
activation. However, in refractory celiac sprue patients, NKG2D mediated
a direct activating signal. ELISA detected soluble MICA in serum in half
of untreated CD patients, but in few patients on gluten-free diets; the
presence of soluble MICA was independent of MICA genotype. Hue et al.
(2004) proposed that villous atrophy in CD may be ascribed to
IEL-mediated damage to enterocytes involving NKG2D-MICA interaction
after gliadin-induced expression of MICA on gut epithelium.

Kriegeskorte et al. (2005) showed that the NKG2D ligands H60 and MICA
could mediate strong suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation. The
suppression did not occur in Il10 (124092)-deficient mice and involved a
receptor other than NKG2D. Kriegeskorte et al. (2005) concluded that
NKG2D ligands can induce strong inhibitory effects in addition to
stimulatory effects

Kaiser et al. (2007) showed that on the surface of tumor cells, MICA
associates with endoplasmic reticulum protein-5 (ERP5; 611099), which,
similar to protein disulfide isomerase (176790), usually assists in the
folding of nascent proteins inside cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of
thioreductase activity and ERP5 gene silencing revealed that
cell-surface ERP5 function is required for MICA shedding. ERP5 and
membrane-anchored MICA formed transitory mixed disulfide complexes from
which soluble MICA was released after proteolytic cleavage near the cell
membrane. Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that reduction of the seemingly
inaccessible disulfide bond in the membrane-proximal alpha-3 domain of
MICA must involve a large conformational change that enables proteolytic
cleavage. They concluded that their results uncovered a molecular
mechanism whereby domain-specific deconstruction regulates MICA protein
shedding, thereby promoting tumor immune evasion, and identified surface
ERP5 as a strategic target for therapeutic intervention.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using multiwavelength-anomalous dispersion phases at a resolution of 2.7
angstroms, Li et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of MICA and
NKG2D. They showed that NKG2D forms a homodimer that interacts with a
MICA monomer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The predicted amino acid sequence of the MICA chain suggests that it
folds similarly to typical class I chains and may have the capacity to
bind peptides or other short ligands (Bahram et al., 1994). Therefore,
MICA was predicted to have a specialized function in antigen
presentation or T cell recognition. During nucleotide sequence analyses
of the MICA genomic clone, Mizuki et al. (1997) found a triplet repeat
microsatellite polymorphism (GCT/AGC)n in the transmembrane region of
the MICA gene. In 68 HLA homozygous B cell lines, 5 distinct alleles of
this microsatellite sequence were detected. One of them contained an
additional 1-bp insertion that created a frameshift resulting in a
premature termination codon in the transmembrane region. This particular
allele was thought to encode a soluble, secreted form of the MICA
molecule. Mizuki et al. (1997) also investigated this microsatellite
polymorphism in 77 Japanese patients with Behcet disease (109650), which
had previously been known to be associated with HLA-B51. The
microsatellite allele consisting of 6 repetitions of GCT/AGC was present
at significantly higher frequency in the patient population (Pc =
0.00055) than in a control population. Furthermore, the (GCT/AGC)6
allele was present in all B51 positive patients and in an additional 13
B51 negative patients. These results suggested the possibility of a
primary association of Behcet disease with MICA rather than HLA-B.

Wallace et al. (1999) investigated the association of the 16 previously
described external domain alleles and the transmembrane triplet repeats
of the MICA gene with Behcet disease in a Middle Eastern population. The
results showed an increase of MICA*009 in the Behcet disease patient
group (44 of 95; 46%) compared with controls (24 of 102; 24%), giving an
odds ratio (OR) of 2.8. The A6 form of a MICA transmembrane triplet
repeat was found to be significantly raised in the patients (80 of 95;
84%) compared with controls (58 of 102; 57%), giving an OR of 4. The
most significant association was that between Behcet disease and
HLA-B51. Wallace et al. (1999) interpreted the data as indicating that
since both MICA*009 and A6 are in strong linkage disequilibrium with
HLA-B51, they are unlikely to be the susceptibility genes for Behcet
disease but may be markers for additional risk factors.

Mizuki et al. (2000) studied the localization of the pathogenic gene of
Behcet disease using microsatellite analysis of 3 different populations:
Japanese, Greek, and Italian. In genotypic differentiation between
patients and controls, the authors found that only HLA-B51 was
significantly associated with BD in all 3 populations. These results
suggested that the pathogenic gene of BD is HLA-B51 itself and not other
genes located in the vicinity of HLA-B.

The MICA and MICB genes are polymorphic, displaying an unusual
distribution of a number of variant amino acids in their extracellular
alpha-1, alpha-2, and alpha-3 domains. To further define the
polymorphism of MICA, Petersdorf et al. (1999) examined its alleles
among 275 individuals with common and rare HLA genotypes. Of 16
previously defined alleles, 12 were confirmed, and 5 new alleles were
identified. A 2-by-2 analysis of MICA and HLA-B alleles uncovered a
number of significant associations. These results confirmed and extended
previous knowledge on the polymorphism of MICA. Petersdorf et al. (1999)
suggested that a strong positive linkage of certain MICA and HLA-B
alleles may have implications for studies related to MHC-associated
diseases and transplantation.

Komatsu-Wakui et al. (1999) studied polymorphisms in the MICA gene in
Japanese. They observed 8 MICA alleles in Japanese individuals, among
which 1, tentatively named MIC-AMW, had not previously been reported.
There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between MICA and HLA-B loci;
each MICA allele showed strong association with a particular HLA-B
group. Komatsu-Wakui et al. (1999) also identified a MICA-MICB null
haplotype, which was associated with HLAB*4801. In this haplotype, they
found large-scale deletion (of approximately 100 kb), including the
entire MICA gene, and a MICB gene that possessed a stop codon.

To summarize, the MICA gene has a microsatellite repeat, GCT(n), within
exon 5, encoding for a variable number of alanines (Ala = A).
Perez-Rodriguez et al. (2000) described a novel MICA allele with 10 GCT
repeats (A10); 4 different repeats of this microsatellite had been
previously reported: A4, A5, A6, and A9. An association of Behcet
disease with the A9 repeat had been reported by Mizuki et al. (1997).

Gambelunghe et al. (2001) concluded the existence of distinct genetic
markers for childhood/young-onset IDDM (222100) and for adult-onset
IDDM, namely the MICA5 and MICA5.1 alleles, respectively.

Mei et al. (2009) analyzed the relationship between Chlamydia
trachomatis, tubal pathology, and MICA allele polymorphisms in 214
infertile Chinese women. They found no association between MICA alleles
and the presence or absence of tubal pathology in infertile women with
antibodies to C. trachomatis. However, an association was found between
the MICA*008 allele and infertile women without antibodies to C.
trachomatis. Mei et al. (2009) concluded that MICA may modify host
susceptibility to C. trachomatis infection.

Aquino-Galvez et al. (2009) analyzed the MICA gene in 80 sporadic
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; 178500) and 201
controls and found a significant increase of MICA*001 allele in the IPF
cohort (odds ratio, 2.91; corrected p = 0.03). In addition, the MICA
*001/*00201 genotype was significantly increased in patients with IPF
compared with healthy controls (odds ratio, 4.72; corrected p = 0.01).
Strong immunoreactive MICA staining was localized in alveolar epithelial
cells and fibroblasts from IPF lungs, whereas control lungs were
negative. Soluble MICA was detected in 35% of IPF patients compared to
12% of control subjects (p = 0.0007). The expression of the MICA
receptor NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) was significantly decreased in
gamma/delta T cells and natural killer cells obtained from IPF lungs.
Aquino-Galvez et al. (2009) concluded that MICA polymorphisms and
abnormal expression of NKG2D might contribute to IPF susceptibility.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the MICA
region and progression from chronic hepatitis C to hepatocellular
carcinoma, see 114550.

ANIMAL MODEL

The MICA/MICB locus is not conserved in mice; however, mice do have
counterpart NKG2D ligands, Rae1-beta and H60. Diefenbach et al. (2001)
demonstrated that ectopic expression of these ligands in tumor cell
lines resulted not only in potent rejection mediated by either NK cells
or CD8-positive T cells, but that mice subsequently challenged with
tumor cell lines not expressing the ligands were also immune to the
tumors. Girardi et al. (2001) determined that immunity to cutaneous
malignancies could be mediated by NKG2D-expressing intraepithelial
gamma/delta T cells. Girardi et al. (2001) proposed that the diverse
expression of NKG2D on cytolytic cell types may allow attacks on tumor
cells in different anatomical compartments and that gamma/delta T cells
may be particularly important in skin and gut.

600270	TITLE *600270 PROCOLLAGEN C-ENDOPEPTIDASE ENHANCER; PCOLCE
;;PROCOLLAGEN, TYPE I, COOH-TERMINAL PROTEINASE ENHANCER
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Type I procollagen COOH-terminal proteinase enhancer is a glycoprotein
that binds to the COOH-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen and
enhances C-proteinase activity (Takahara et al., 1994).

CLONING

Takahara et al. (1994) purified type I procollagen COOH-terminal
proteinase enhancer (Pcolce) from mouse fibroblast culture medium.
Sequences of mouse enhancer cDNA predicted a 468-amino acid protein.
Takahara et al. (1994) noted that in the mouse, procollagen C-proteinase
depends for full expression upon the presence of either a 55-kD
glycoprotein or smaller 36- and 34-kD proteolytically processed forms of
the same protein. They showed that the 36-kD form corresponds to the
N-terminal portion of the 55-kD form, which is composed almost
exclusively of 2 CUB domains. Mouse enhancer RNA was shown to be at
highest levels in collagen-rich tissues, especially tendon.

Takahara et al. (1994) cloned human PCOLCE from a placenta cDNA library.
The deduced 449-amino acid protein shares high sequence homology with
the mouse protein, particularly in the CUB domains in the N terminus.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of genomic DNA from panels of human/mouse cell
hybrids and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Takahara et al.
(1994) localized the PCOLCE gene to 7q21.3-q22, the same region
containing the type I collagen alpha-2 chain gene (COL1A2; 120160).
Takahara et al. (1996) investigated further the apparent proximity of
the 2 genes by the study of somatic cell hybrids, cosmid contigs, and
interspecific backcross mice. They found that PCOLCE and COL1A2 are
separated by at least 6 Mb and that Pcolce and Col1a2 are located on
separate chromosomes in the mouse, chromosomes 5 and 6, respectively.

176930	TITLE *176930 COAGULATION FACTOR II; F2
;;THROMBIN;;
PROTHROMBIN;;
FACTOR II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The F2 gene encodes coagulation factor II (EC 3.4.21.5), or prothrombin,
a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein synthesized in the liver as an
inactive zymogen. Prothrombin is activated to the serine protease
thrombin by factor Xa (F10; 613872) in the presence of phospholipids,
calcium, and factor Va (F5; 612309). The activated thrombin enzyme plays
an important role in hemostasis and thrombosis: it converts fibrinogen
(134820) to fibrin for blood clot formation, stimulates platelet
aggregation, and activates coagulation factors V, VIII (F8; 300841), and
XIII (F13A1; 134570). Thrombin also inhibits coagulation by activating
protein C (PROC; 612283) (summary by Lancellotti and De Cristofaro,
2009).

CLONING

Degen and Davie (1987) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
prothrombin gene, which encodes a 622-residue pre-propeptide with a
molecular mass of about 70 kD. The mature circulating protein has 579
residues. The prothrombin protein contains 5 domains: the propeptide
(residues -43 to -1), the Gla domain (residues 1 to 40), a kringle
domain (residues 41 to 155), a kringle-2 domain (residues 156 to 271),
and a serine protease domain (residues 272 to 579). The prothrombin
protein undergoes several cleavage events to generate the active enzyme
alpha-thrombin, which is composed of a light (alpha) and heavy (beta)
chain covalently linked by a disulfide bond (summary by Lancellotti and
De Cristofaro, 2009).

Degen et al. (1990) cloned cDNAs for mouse coagulation factor II and
compared the gene and predicted protein structure with that of human
prothrombin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Degen and Davie (1987) determined that the prothrombin gene contains 14
exons and spans about 21 kb. The gene contains 30 Alu repeats and 2 Kpn
repeats, which constitute about 40% of the gene.

MAPPING

Royle et al. (1987) assigned the gene for human prothrombin (F2) to
chromosome 11p11-q12 by analysis of a panel of somatic cell hybrid DNAs
and by in situ hybridization, using both cDNA and genomic probes.

Degen et al. (1990) mapped the mouse F2 gene to chromosome 2, about 1.8
map units proximal to the catalase locus.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Celikel et al. (2003) determined that the structure of platelet GP1BA
(606672) bound to thrombin at 2.3 angstrom resolution and defined 2
sites that bind to exosite II and exosite I of 2 distinct alpha-thrombin
molecules, respectively. GP1BA occupancy may be sequential, as the site
binding to alpha-thrombin exosite I appears to be cryptic in the
unoccupied receptor but exposed when a first thrombin molecule is bound
through exosite II. Celikel et al. (2003) suggested that these
interactions may modulate alpha-thrombin function by mediating GP1BA
clustering and cleavage of protease-activator receptors, which promote
platelet activation, while limiting fibrinogen clotting through blockade
of exosite I.

Dumas et al. (2003) independently determined the crystal structure of
the GP1BA-thrombin complex at 2.6 angstrom resolution. They found that
in the crystal lattice, the periodic arrangement of GP1BA-thrombin
complexes mirrors a scaffold that could serve as a driving force for
tight platelet adhesion.

Kroh et al. (2009) found that von Willebrand factor-binding protein
(VWFBP), which is secreted by Staphyloccocus aureus, is a potent
nonenzymatic conformational activator of prothrombin. VWFBP was found to
share homology with staphylocoagulase, another protein secreted by
Staphylococcus aureus that can activate prothrombin. However, the
mechanism of VWFBP activation of prothrombin was different from that of
staphylocoagulase, with VWFBP showing weaker affinity for prothrombin
and resulting in a slow conformational change with a specific need for
binding of the substrate fibrinogen to complete the process. The
findings suggested a unique mechanism for fibrin deposition during S.
aureus endocarditis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

- Congenital Prothrombin Deficiency and Dysprothrombinemia

Congenital prothrombin deficiency, also known as hypoprothrombinemia
(613679), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe
bleeding manifestations and decreased prothrombin antigen levels and
activity to below 10% of normal values. Dysprothrombinemia, which is
characterized by normal antigen levels but a dysfunctional prothrombin
molecule, shows a more variable level in bleeding tendency, and there is
often a good correlation between the levels of prothrombin activity and
clinical severity. Akhavan et al. (2002) stated that 32 molecular
defects in prothrombin had been identified. Complete prothrombin
deficiency, or aprothombinemia, is believed to be incompatible with life
(review by Meeks and Abshire, 2008).

The allelic variants causing dysprothrombinemia are usually indicated
according to the city or area where they were described for the first
time: see, e.g., prothrombin Barcelona (176930.0002) and prothrombin
Tokushima (176930.0003). The abnormalities are usually caused by a
defect in activation of the protease, such as prothrombin Barcelona, or
a defect in the protease itself, such as prothrombin Quick (176930.0004;
176930.0005) and prothrombin Tokushima (reviews by Girolami et al., 1998
and Lancellotti and De Cristofaro, 2009).

- Thrombophilia

Poort et al. (1996) described a common genetic variation in the 3-prime
untranslated region of the prothrombin gene that is associated with
elevated plasma prothrombin levels and an increased risk of venous
thrombosis (THPH1; 188050): a 20210G-A transition (176930.0009) (Degen
and Davie, 1987). They found this single base substitution in 18% of
probands of thrombophilic families, 6% of unselected consecutive
patients with deep vein thrombosis, and 2% of healthy controls.
Rosendaal et al. (1997) found that the mutation was associated with a
4-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction in women, while among men
the risk was increased 1.5-fold (Doggen et al., 1998).

Martinelli et al. (1998) found that the 20210G-A mutation in the
prothrombin gene (176930.0009) and the factor V Leiden mutation
(612309.0001) are associated with 'idiopathic' cerebral vein thrombosis.
The use of oral contraceptives was also strongly and independently
associated with the disorder. The presence of both the prothrombin gene
mutation and oral contraceptive use raised the risk of cerebral vein
thrombosis further. The F2 and F5 mutations had previously been known to
be common genetic determinants of deep vein thrombosis of the lower
extremities. Cerebral vein thrombosis is a frightening event because of
the severity of the clinical manifestations and the high mortality rate,
estimated to be 5 to 30%. Clinically, cerebral vein thrombosis presents
with a wide range of symptoms, including headache, focal deficits (motor
or sensory), dysphasia, seizures, and impaired consciousness. The
findings of Martinelli et al. (1998) represent a prime example of the
interaction of endogenous (genetic) and exogenous factors in causation
of disease (Bertina and Rosendaal, 1998).

De Stefano et al. (1999) examined the relative risk of recurrent deep
venous thrombosis using a proportional-hazards model. The authors found
that while patients who were heterozygous for factor V Leiden had a risk
of recurrent deep venous thrombosis that was similar to that among
patients who had no known mutations in either factor II or factor V,
patients who were heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and prothrombin
20210G-A had a 2.6-fold higher risk of recurrent thrombosis than did
carriers of factor V Leiden alone.

The factor V Leiden mutation (612309.0001) and the 20210G-A mutation in
the prothrombin gene (176930.0009) are the most frequent abnormalities
associated with venous thromboembolism. Martinelli et al. (2000)
compared the prevalence and incidence rate of venous thromboembolism in
relatives with either of these 2 mutations or both. The study population
included 1,076 relatives of probands with the prothrombin gene mutation,
factor V Leiden, or both, who underwent screening for inherited
thrombophilia and were found to be carriers of single mutations or
double mutations or who were noncarriers. The prevalence of venous
thromboembolism was 5.7% in relatives with the prothrombin gene
mutation, 7.8% in those with factor V Leiden, 17.1% in those with both
mutations, and 2.5% in noncarriers. Annual incidences of thrombosis were
0.13%, 0.19%, 0.42%, and 0.066%, respectively. The relative risk of
thrombosis was 2 times higher in carriers of the prothrombin gene
mutation, 3 times higher in those with factor V Leiden, and 6 times
higher in double carriers than in noncarriers. The incidence of venous
thromboembolism in carriers of the prothrombin gene mutation was
slightly lower than that observed in carriers of factor V Leiden,
whereas in carriers of both mutations it was 2 or 3 times higher. From
these findings, Martinelli et al. (2000) concluded that lifelong primary
anticoagulant prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism is not needed in
asymptomatic carriers of single or double mutations. Anticoagulant
prophylaxis seems to be indicated only when transient risk factors for
thrombosis coexist with mutations.

In affected members of a Japanese family with recurrent thrombophilia,
Miyawaki et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous mutation in the F2 gene
(R596L; 176930.0015). The family had originally been reported by Sakai
et al. (2001). In vitro ELISA studies showed that the mutant prothrombin
did not form a complex with antithrombin (SERPINC1; 107300) even when
heparin was added. A thrombin generation assay showed that the mutant
prothrombin activity was lower than wildtype, but its inactivation in
reconstituted plasma was exceedingly slow. Miyawaki et al. (2012)
concluded that although the procoagulant activity of the R596L mutant
prothrombin was somewhat impaired, the antithrombin:thrombin complex was
considerably impaired, causing continued facilitation of coagulation.
The findings indicated that R596L was a gain-of-function mutation
resulting in the resistance to antithrombin, and conferring
susceptibility to thrombosis. The mutant variant was termed 'prothrombin
Yukuhashi.'

- Susceptibility to Recurrent Pregnancy Loss

Pihusch et al. (2001) studied clotting factors in 102 patients with 2 or
more consecutive spontaneous abortions (RPRGL2; 614390) compared to 128
women without miscarriage and found that heterozygosity for the 20210G-A
mutation of prothrombin (176930.0009) was more common in patients with
abortions in the first trimester (p = 0.027; odds ratio, 8.5). Noting
that in addition to fibrin generation, thrombin also activates tissue
components represented in the placenta and induces cellular responses,
Pihusch et al. (2001) suggested that increased prothrombin levels might
affect placental function by influencing pivotal mechanisms such as cell
adhesion, smooth muscle proliferation, and vasculogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Several observations suggest that prothrombin may serve a broader
physiologic role than simply stemming blood loss, including the
identification of multiple G protein-coupled, thrombin-activated
receptors, and the well-documented mitogenic activity of thrombin in in
vitro test systems. To explore further the physiologic roles of
prothrombin in vivo, Sun et al. (1998) generated prothrombin-deficient
mice by knockout techniques. Inactivation of the F2 gene led to partial
embryonic lethality with more than half of the F2 -/- embryos dying
between embryonic days 9.5 and 11.5. Bleeding into the yolk sac cavity
and varying degrees of tissue necrosis were observed in many of the F2
-/- embryos within this gestational time frame. At least one-quarter of
the F2 -/- mice survived to term, but they ultimately developed fatal
hemorrhagic events and died within a few days of birth. The study
demonstrated that F2 is important in maintaining vascular integrity
during development as well as in postnatal life.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PROTHROMBIN TYPE 3
F2, GLU157LYS

Board and Shaw (1983) showed that prothrombin type 3 is due to a
glu157-to-lys (E157K) substitution in the F2 gene. This was the first
identification of the specific change in a variant prothrombin, isolated
from individuals heterozygous for prothrombin type 3. This substitution
explained the relatively slow electrophoretic mobility of prothrombin
type 3 compared to wildtype at alkaline pH.

.0002
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ARG271CYS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Barcelona.

In a patient with normal prothrombin antigen levels, but low prothrombin
coagulant activity (see 613679) (Rabiet et al., 1979), Rabiet et al.
(1986) found that the defect was due to an arg271-to-cys (R271C)
substitution in the F2 gene. The peptide bond between arg271 and thr272
is one of 2 sites of cleavage by factor Xa, indicating that activation
of the variant Barcelona prothrombin protein to functional thrombin was
impaired.

.0003
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ARG418TRP

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Tokushima.

In a 10-year-old Japanese girl who was compound heterozygous for
dysprothrombinemia (see 613679) and hypoprothrombinemia, Miyata et al.
(1987) identified a heterozygous 9490T-to-C transition in the F2 gene,
resulting in an arg418-to-trp (R418W) substitution on the maternal
allele. The patient had originally been reported by Inomoto et al.
(1987), who determined that the prothrombin variant showed about 22%
clotting activity and reduced platelet aggregating activity, suggesting
a defect in the catalytic region (Lancellotti and De Cristofaro, 2009).
Shirakami et al. (1983) and Shirakami and Kawauchi (1984) concluded from
study of this pedigree that the proband was a 'double heterozygote' for
a dysprothrombinemia variant (R418W), inherited from the mother, and a
hypoprothrombinemia (613679) variant, inherited from the father. Indeed,
Iwahana et al. (1992) determined that the hypoprothombinemia variant
inherited from the father was a 1-bp insertion (4177insT; 176930.0008).

.0004
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ARG382CYS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Quick I.

A patient with dysprothrombinemia (see 613679) originally studied by
Quick et al. (1955), Quick and Hussey (1962), and Owen et al. (1978) was
later found to be compound heterozygous for 2 defective alleles in the
F2 gene. Henriksen and Mann (1988) identified a heterozygous C-to-T
transition resulting in an arg382-to-cys (R382C) substitution, and
Henriksen and Mann (1989) identified a heterozygous G-to-T transversion
resulting in a gly558-to-val (G558V; 176930.0005) substitution. The
patient had less than 2% of normal prothrombin activity. Laboratory
studies by Henriksen and Mann (1988, 1989) showed that both variants
resulted in a structural change in the catalytic region causing
defective interaction with fibrinogen.

Banfield and MacGillivray (1992) found that the arginine residue at
codon 382 is conserved in 11 species ranging from the human to the gecko
(a lizard), the newt, and fish, including rainbow trout, sturgeon, and
the hagfish.

.0005
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, GLY558VAL

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Quick II.

See 176930.0004 and Henriksen and Mann (1989).

.0006
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, MET337THR

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Himi I.

In a girl with dysprothrombinemia (see 613679), Morishita et al. (1992)
found a congenitally dysfunctional form of prothrombin, called
prothrombin Himi, which was associated with reduced fibrinogen clotting
activity, although it retained full hydrolytic activity toward synthetic
substrates. Because previous findings suggested that the functional
defect of prothrombin Himi was caused by an abnormality in the thrombin
portion of the protein, Morishita et al. (1992) amplified the genomic
DNA regions corresponding to exons 8 through 14 and applied
single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Two variant conformers
in exon 10 were identified in the proband with this variant: an 8751T-C
transition resulting in a met337-to-thr (M337T) substitution inherited
from the father, and an 8904G-A transition resulting in an arg388-to-his
(R388H; 176930.0007) substitution inherited from the mother.

.0007
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA PROTHROMBIN HIMI-II
F2, ARG388HIS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Himi II.

See 176930.0006 and Morishita et al. (1992).

.0008
HYPOPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, 1-BP INS, 4177T

In a Japanese girl who was compound heterozygous for hypoprothrombinemia
(613679) and dysprothrombinemia, Iwahana et al. (1992) demonstrated a
heterozygous 1-bp insertion (4177insT) in exon 6 of the F2 gene
inherited from her father. This defect was the basis of the
hypoprothrombinemia. The resulting frameshift mutation caused both an
altered amino acid sequence from codon 114 and a premature termination
codon (TGA) at codon 174 in exon 7. Because exon 7 encodes the kringle-2
domain preceding the thrombin sequence, the frameshift led to the null
prothrombin phenotype. The girl was compound heterozygous for 4177insT
and an R418W (176930.0003) substitution, which was the basis of the
dysprothrombinemia (see 613679).

THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO THROMBIN DEFECT
STROKE, ISCHEMIC, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED;;
PREGNANCY LOSS, RECURRENT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2, INCLUDED
F2, 20210G-A

Rosendaal et al. (1998) presented data from 11 centers and 9 countries,
representing a total of 5,527 tested individuals. Among these, 111
heterozygous carriers of the 20210A mutation were found, yielding an
overall prevalence of 2.0%. In southern Europe, the prevalence was 3.0%,
nearly twice as high as the prevalence in northern Europe (1.7%). The
prothrombin variant appeared to be rare in individuals of Asian and
African descent.

To discern whether the 20210G-A polymorphism originated from a single or
recurrent mutation event, Zivelin et al. (1998) determined allele
frequencies of 4 dimorphisms spanning 16 of 21 kb of the factor II gene
in 133 unrelated Caucasian subjects of Jewish, Austrian, and French
origins who bore factor II 20210A (10 homozygotes and 123 heterozygotes)
and 110 Caucasian controls. Remarkable differences in the allele
frequencies for each dimorphism were observed between the study groups
(p = 0.0007 or less), indicating strong linkage disequilibrium and
suggesting a founder effect. Indeed, a founder haplotype was present in
68% of 20210A mutant alleles and in only 34% of 20210G normal alleles (p
less than 0.0001). These data strongly supported a single origin for the
factor II polymorphism. Because the polymorphism is rare or absent in
non-Caucasian populations, it probably occurred after divergence of
Africans from non-Africans and of Caucasoids from Mongoloid
subpopulations.

Rees et al. (1999) analyzed samples from 22 different non-European
countries and found that the prothrombin 20210G-A variant, like factor V
Leiden (612309.0001), is rare outside Europe. Of 1,811 non-Europeans
tested, they found only 1 individual, in India, who had the mutation in
heterozygous state.

Zivelin et al. (2006) analyzed the frequencies of 5 SNPs and 9
microsatellites flanking the prothrombin gene in 88 homozygotes for
20210A and 66 homozygotes for 20210G. For estimating the age of the
prothrombin 20210G-A mutation, they analyzed linkage disequilibrium
between the mutation and the multiple markers that had been assessed.
The analysis yielded an age estimate of 23,720 years. A similar analysis
was performed for factor V Leiden (612309.0001) yielding an age estimate
of 21,340 years. The occurrence of the 2 mutations in whites toward the
end of the last glaciation and their presently wide distribution in
whites suggested selective evolutionary advantages for which some
evidence was reported (diminished blood loss) or is controversial
(protection against infections). The selected disadvantage from
thrombosis is unlikely because until recent centuries humans did not
live long enough to manifest a meaningful incidence of thrombosis.

Thrombophilia

Poort et al. (1996) found that a common genetic 20210G-A transition in
the 3-prime untranslated region of the prothrombin gene (Degen and
Davie, 1987) was associated with elevated plasma prothrombin levels and
an increased risk of venous thrombosis (THPH1; 188050). The SNP was
found in 18% of probands of families with thrombosis, 6% of unselected
consecutive patients with deep vein thrombosis, and 2% of healthy
controls. Rosendaal et al. (1997) found that the mutation was associated
with a 4-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction in women, while
among men the risk was increased 1.5-fold (Doggen et al., 1998).

Franco et al. (1999) found a frequency of the 20210A allele of 1% in a
400-member healthy control population and 2.7% in 263 patients with
proven premature atherosclerotic disease. All heterozygotes in the
patient group were found to have had a myocardial infarction. In
addition, the data provided evidence for an association of the mutation
with excessive thrombin generation, which may contribute to the
understanding of its role in venous and arterial disease.

Chamouard et al. (1999) studied the frequency of the factor II 20210G-A
mutation in 10 white European patients with idiopathic portal vein
thrombosis. They studied 5 women and 5 men; mean age was 50.4 years. The
frequency of the 20210G-A mutation was found to be 40% in idiopathic
portal vein thrombosis compared with 4.8% in controls or patients with
nonidiopathic portal vein thrombosis or deep vein thrombosis. The
frequency of the factor V Leiden mutation (612309.0001) was similar in
subjects with portal vein thrombosis and in controls but was increased
in patients with deep vein thrombosis.

De Stefano et al. (1999) found that patients who were heterozygous for
both factor V Leiden (1691G-A; 612309.0001) and prothrombin 20210G-A had
a 2.6-fold higher risk of recurrent thrombosis than did carriers of
factor V Leiden alone. Patients who were heterozygous for factor V
Leiden had a risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis that was similar
to that among patients who had no known mutations in either factor II or
factor V.

In a Spanish family, Corral et al. (1999) identified 3 subjects
homozygous for the 20210A prothrombin mutation who additionally were
heterozygous for factor V Leiden. The combination of the 2 mutations
increased the risk of developing venous thrombotic episodes at an
earlier age. However, even in association with factor V Leiden, the
homozygous condition of the 20210A prothrombin mutation required
additional risk factors to induce a thrombotic event.

Humpert et al. (1999) screened 384 type 1 diabetic patients for the
20210G-A prothrombin polymorphism and detected the variant in 9
patients. There was no increase in the incidence of coronary heart
disease, nephropathy, or retinopathy among diabetic patients carrying
the 20210G-A polymorphism.

Meyer et al. (1999) described a method for simultaneously genotyping for
factor V Leiden and the prothrombin 20210G-A variant by a multiplex
PCR-SSCP assay on whole blood. Prohaska et al. (1999) studied 284
patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease for the
presence of the 20210G-A polymorphism of the prothrombin gene and
compared them with 340 healthy controls. The prevalence of the mutation
was similar in both groups. There was a mild increase in the frequency
of the mutation in a group of 294 venous thrombosis patients compared
with the healthy controls (odds ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.25-6.9).

One of the main factors of sudden hearing impairment, vestibular
disturbance (tinnitus), is generally thought to be an acute labyrinthine
ischemia; the most common mechanism of sudden hearing loss appears to be
impaired cochlear blood circulation. Mercier et al. (1999) provided
evidence that the 20210A allele of the prothrombin gene is a risk factor
for perception deafness. Among 368 patients (median age, 41 years) with
spontaneous deep vein thrombosis, 18 (12 women and 6 men, 38 to 69 years
of age) had also suffered from acute unilateral hearing impairment. Six
of the 18 were heterozygous for the 20210A allele. In a group of 395
nonthrombotic consecutive patients studied in the same laboratory for
hemorrhagic symptoms or thrombocytopenia over the same period of time, 4
had acute unilateral perception deafness; of 395 nonthrombotic and
nonhemorrhagic sex- and age-matched controls, 6 had acute unilateral
perception deafness.

Souto et al. (1999) reported a family illustrating the complexity of
thrombotic disease in relation to the 20210A variant. The pedigree was
ascertained through a proband with idiopathic thrombophilia. The family
members who had a history of thromboembolism were heterozygous carriers
of the 20210A variant. In addition, 4 relatives who were heterozygous as
well as 2 who were homozygous for the 20210A allele failed to show
clinical manifestations. The 2 homozygotes were 51 and 19 years old.

Gehring et al. (2001) demonstrated that the 20210G-A mutation does not
affect the amount of pre-mRNA, the site of 3-prime end cleavage, or the
length of poly(A) tail of the mature mRNA. Rather, Gehring et al. (2001)
demonstrated that the physiologic F2 3-prime end cleavage signal is
inefficient and that F2 20210G-A represents a gain-of-function mutation,
causing increased cleavage site recognition, increased 3-prime end
processing, and increased mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis.
Enhanced mRNA 3-prime end formation efficiency emerges as a novel
principle causing a genetic disorder and explains the role of the F2
20210G-A mutation in the pathogenesis of thrombophilia. Gehring et al.
(2001) concluded that their work illustrates the pathophysiologic
importance of quantitatively minor aberrations of RNA metabolism.

Although the 20210G-A mutation in heterozygous state carries an
increased risk of a first venous thromboembolic episode, De Stefano et
al. (2001) found that the risk of spontaneous recurrent venous
thromboembolism was similar to that in patients with normal genotype.
They concluded that carriers of the prothrombin mutation should be
treated with oral anticoagulants after a first deep venous thrombosis
for a similar length of time as patients with a normal genotype.

Laczika et al. (2002) described a 19-year-old woman with the joint
occurrence of type I antithrombin III deficiency (613118) and a
heterozygous prothrombin 20210G-A mutation, who developed chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension on the basis of total occlusion of
the right pulmonary artery. Pulmonary vascular patency was restored
successfully by surgical pulmonary thromboendarterectomy performed 24
weeks after the initial clinical presentation.

Segal et al. (2009) provided a metaanalysis of the predictive value of
the prothrombin 20210G-A mutation for venous thromboembolism using a
literature review of 10 relevant articles. Although heterozygosity for
prothrombin 20210G-A in probands conferred a risk of 1.45, the
confidence interval ranged from 0.96 to 2.2, suggesting that the
mutation was not predictive of recurrent venous thromboembolism compared
to those without the mutation. In addition, there was insufficient
evidence regarding the predictive value of homozygosity for prothrombin
20210G-A in probands, and for the predictive value of being a mutation
carrier in relatives of probands with the mutation. It remained unknown
whether testing improved clinical outcomes. Segal et al. (2009)
concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis
that 20210G-A confers a significantly increased risk for venous
thromboembolism in terms of genetic testing.

Ischemic Stroke

In a comprehensive metaanalysis of 19 case-control studies including
3,028 white adult patients, Casas et al. (2004) found a statistically
significant association between ischemic stroke (601367) and the
20210G-A substitution (odds ratio of 1.44).

Budd-Chiari Syndrome

In a 37-year-old Caucasian male with polycythemia vera who had developed
Budd-Chiari syndrome (BDCHS; 600880), Bucciarelli et al. (1998)
identified heterozygosity for the 20210G-A substitution. His paternal
grandmother had died at the age of 60 due to BDCHS, and his father, who
was also heterozygous for the mutation, had had a myocardial infarction
at age 55. Bucciarelli et al. (1998) excluded deficiencies of
antithrombin, protein C, and protein S, as well as the presence of
antiphospholipid syndrome and the factor V Leiden mutation. They
suggested case-control studies to establish if carriers of the 20210G-A
mutation have an increased risk of developing BDCHS.

Oner et al. (1999) described Budd-Chiari syndrome in a patient
heterozygous for both the 20210G-A mutation of F2 and the factor V
Leiden mutation; heterozygosity for the factor V Leiden mutation is a
known susceptibility factor for BDCHS. Oner et al. (1999) referred to
the 20210G-A mutation by the abbreviation PM, presumably for
'prothrombin mutation.'

Susceptibility to Recurrent Pregnancy Loss

Pihusch et al. (2001) studied clotting factors in 102 patients with 2 or
more consecutive spontaneous abortions (RPRGL2; 614390) compared to 128
women without miscarriage and found that heterozygosity for the 20210G-A
mutation of prothrombin was more common in patients with abortions in
the first trimester (p = 0.027; odds ratio, 8.5).

DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, GLU300LYS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Denver I.

Montgomery et al. (1980) described a form of dysprothrombinemia (see
613679) in a proband with a severe hemophilia-like bleeding disorder who
was treated with weekly prophylactic prothrombin replacement. Lefkowitz
et al. (2000) found that the patient was a compound heterozygote for 2
mutations in the F2 gene: glu300-to-lys (E300K) and glu309-to-lys
(E309K; 176930.0011). Factor II activity was 5 units/dl and factor II
antigen was 21 units/dl. The functional defect was apparently in the
activation of zymogen to enzyme.

.0011
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, GLU309LYS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Denver II.

See (176930.0010) and Lefkowitz et al. (2000).

.0012
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ARG382HIS

Akhavan et al. (2000) described a homozygous arg382-to-his (R382H)
substitution in the prothrombin gene of an Iranian girl with
dysprothrombinemia (see 613679). The only symptoms were sporadic
ecchymosis and 1 episode of buttock hematoma following a major trauma. A
substitution in this residue had been identified in the compound
heterozygous dysprothrombins Quick I (R382C; 176930.0004) and Corpus
Christi.

Akhavan et al. (2002) investigated the functional properties of the
R382H mutant protein. Their experiments showed that the R382H
substitution drastically affected both the procoagulant and the
anticoagulant functions of thrombin as well as its inhibition by heparin
cofactor II (142360). The mild hemorrhagic phenotype may be explained by
abnormalities that ultimately counterbalance each other.

.0013
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ASP552GLU

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Saint-Denis.

In a male newborn with dysprothrombinemia (see 613679), Rouy et al.
(2006) identified a new prothrombin variant, with a point mutation at
nucleotide 20029 resulting in an asp552-to-glu (D552E) substitution.
Prothrombin levels were reduced in each of 3 assays. The substitution
did not affect the rate of prothrombin conversion to thrombin, but
altered thrombin activity. Amino acid 552 had been involved in the
allosteric transition, which is induced by sodium binding to thrombin.
This was the first known amino acid substitution at this site to result
in dysprothrombinemia. The male newborn was referred because of fetal
pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular failure, which resolved
spontaneously. The father and mother, who were first cousins, had a
slight decrease in prothrombin activity and normal levels of prothrombin
antigen. No abnormal bleeding was observed in the proband at birth or in
the first 30 months of his life, and both parents were asymptomatic.

.0014
HYPOPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, TYR44CYS

In a patient with congenital prothrombin deficiency (613679) and severe
bleeding tendency, Poort et al. (1994) identified a homozygous A-to-G
transition in exon 3 of the F2 gene, resulting in a tyr44-to-cys (Y44C)
substitution. Laboratory studies showed factor II activity at about 2%
and antigen levels at about 5%. Both parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. Further family studies revealed complete cosegregation of the
mutation with the prothrombin deficiency. Five homozygous brothers and
sisters of the propositus were clinically affected with severe
hemorrhages, including epistaxis, soft tissue, muscle, and joint
bleedings in all, and severe menorrhagia in the 2 women.

Lancellotti and De Cristofaro (2009) noted that the Y44C mutation
resulted from a 1305A-G change and affected the kringle-1 domain. The
mutation was found in the family with hypoprothrombinemia reported by
Van Creveld (1954).

.0015
THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO THROMBIN DEFECT
F2, ARG596LEU

In affected members of a Japanese family with recurrent thrombophilia
due to thrombin defect (188050), Miyawaki et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 1787G-T transversion in the F2 gene, resulting in an
arg596-to-leu (R596L) substitution within the sodium-binding region of
thrombin and also in 1 of the antithrombin-binding sites. The mutation
was not found in unaffected family members or in 100 control
individuals. In vitro ELISA studies showed that the mutant prothrombin
did not form a complex with antithrombin (SERPINC1; 107300) even when
heparin was added. A thrombin generation assay showed that the mutant
prothrombin activity was lower than wildtype, but its inactivation in
reconstituted plasma was exceedingly slow. Miyawaki et al. (2012)
concluded that although the procoagulant activity of mutant prothrombin
was somewhat impaired due to disruption of the sodium-binding site, the
antithrombin:thrombin complex was considerably impaired due to
disruption of that binding site, causing continued facilitation of
coagulation. The findings indicated that R596L was a gain-of-function
mutation resulting in the resistance to antithrombin, and conferring
susceptibility to thrombosis. The mutant variant was termed 'prothrombin
Yukuhashi.'

173393	TITLE *173393 PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR RECEPTOR; PTAFR
;;PAFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PTAFR shows structural characteristics of the rhodopsin (180380) gene
family and binds platelet-activating factor (PAF). PAF is a phospholipid
(1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) that has been
implicated as a mediator in diverse pathologic processes, such as
allergy, asthma, septic shock, arterial thrombosis, and inflammatory
processes.

CLONING

By PCR using primers based on the sequence of guinea pig PAF receptor to
amplify guinea pig genomic DNA, followed by screening of a human genomic
library, Seyfried et al. (1992) isolated the human PTAFR gene. They
determined that the PAF receptor appears to be a member of the G
protein-coupled family of receptors and exhibits significant similarity
to many members of this family.

Using either a conserved rhodopsin-type receptor sequence or the
sequence of guinea pig PAF receptor as probe to screen cDNA libraries of
hematopoietic origin, Ye et al. (1991), Nakamura et al. (1991), and Kunz
et al. (1992) cloned the cDNA for human PAF receptor. Human PTAFR shares
about 82% identity with the guinea pig PAF receptor. Kunz et al. (1992)
determined that the deduced 342-amino acid protein contains 7 putative
transmembrane domains interspersed with polar peptide segments,
characteristic of rhodopsin-type G protein-dependent receptors. PTAFR
has 2 N-glycosylation sites, but unlike other rhodopsin family members,
there is no N-glycosylation site in the N-terminal segment. Transfection
of PTAFR into COS-7 cells resulted in expression of the receptor with an
extracellular N terminus.

Nakamura et al. (1991) determined that the calculated molecular mass of
the PTAFR protein is about 39.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected
abundant expression of an approximately 3.8-kb PTAFR transcript in
leukocytes, with less expression in undifferentiated eosinophilic or
erythroleukemia cell lines. Ye et al. (1991) detected a 4.0-kb PTAFR
transcript in placenta and lung, but not in heart, brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, kidney, or pancreas. Differentiated HL-60 granulocytes
also expressed PTAFR, but undifferentiated cells did not.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakamura et al. (1991) recorded an electrophysiologic response in
injected Xenopus oocytes following PTAFR expression, and observed that
transfected COS-7 cells showed ligand binding with pharmacologic
properties of the PAF receptor. Activation of the PAF receptor yielded
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in both COS-7 cells and oocytes.
Injection of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog into oocytes inhibited
PAF-induced chloride ion currents, indicating that PAF stimulates
phosphoinositide turnover via G protein(s). The level of PTAFR mRNA
increased in an eosinophilic leukemia cell line treated with
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (138960), IL5 (147850),
and n-butyrate.

Ye et al. (1991) demonstrated that stably transfected mouse fibroblasts
expressing human PTAFR responded to subnanomolar PAF stimulation with
calcium mobilization, which could be inhibited by a PAF antagonist.
Calcium mobilization was PAF-dose-dependent and appeared to result from
an increase in the intracellular level of free calcium, since addition
of EGTA did not alter the calcium response.

Kunz et al. (1992) found that expression of PTAFR in a myeloid cell line
decreased following differentiation induced with dibutyryl-cAMP. They
demonstrated uptake of PAF by PTAFR-transfected COS-7 cells, and the
uptake was blocked by a PAF receptor antagonist.

Cundell et al. (1995) found that the mechanism of Streptococcus
pneumoniae attachment differed between activated and resting cells, and
that PTAFR is utilized to gain entry into activated cells. PAF and the
pneumococcal cell wall share phosphorylcholine as a determinant of
proinflammatory activity. Attachment of bacterial phosphorylcholine to
PTAFR enhanced adherence, which was coupled to invasion of endothelial,
epithelial, and PTAFR-transfected COS-7 cells. This progression was
arrested in vitro and in vivo by PTAFR-specific antagonists. PAF
interaction with PTAFR resulted in activation of phospholipase C (see
604114), but pneumococcal interaction with PTAFR did not. Cundell et al.
(1995) concluded that the binding of bacterial phosphorylcholine to
PTAFR in the absence of signal transduction subverts receptor
internalization to allow cell invasion.

By transduction of PTAFR into a PTAFR-negative epidermal cell line,
Marques et al. (2002) demonstrated that PTAFR activation stimulates ERK
(601795) and p38 (600289) MAP kinases, but not the JNK (601158) MAP
kinase. PTAFR activation also stimulated ERK-dependent cell
proliferation. ERK activation by PTAFR required the cleavage of
membrane-bound heparin-binding EGF (126150) by matrix metalloproteinases
(see 600754) and the subsequent activation of the EGF receptor (131550).
However, activation of p38 by PTAFR occurred through a distinct pathway.

Lukashova et al. (2001) found that PAF induced rapid tyrosine
phosphorylation of TYK2 (176941) in 2 human monocytic cell lines and in
COS-7 cells transfected with PTAFR and TYK2 cDNAs. TYK2
coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with PTAFR independent of ligand
binding. Deletion mutation analysis indicated that the N terminus of
TYK2 bound PTAFR. Activation of TYK2 was followed by a time-dependent 2-
to 4-fold increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1
(600555), STAT2 (600556), and STAT3 (102582), and a sustained 2.5-fold
increase in STAT5 (see 601511) tyrosine phosphorylation. STAT1 and STAT3
translocated to the nucleus following PAF stimulation, and their
translocation was dependent on TYK2 in transiently-transfected COS-7
cells. In the presence of TYK2, PAF induced activation of PTAFR
promoter-1 in a reporter assay. TYK2 activation and signaling by PAF was
independent of G proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Seyfried et al. (1992) determined that the PTAFR coding sequence
contains no introns.

Chase et al. (1993) found evidence for at least 1 intron in the 5-prime
untranslated region of the PTAFR gene.

MAPPING

By analysis of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, Seyfried et al. (1992)
concluded that the PTAFR gene is located on human chromosome 1. Chase et
al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize PTAFR to
1p35-p34.3. By Southern blot analysis, Kunz et al. (1992) determined
that GPR135 is a single-copy gene.

615167	TITLE *615167 LEUCINE-RICH REPEATS- AND WD REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; LRWD1
;;ORIGIN RECOGNITION COMPLEX-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; ORCA;;
ORC-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN;;
CENTROMERE PROTEIN 33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LRWD1 appears to have a critical role in assembly of the prereplication
complex and initiation of DNA replication (Shen et al., 2012). LRWD1 may
also serve as a centrosomal protein during spermatogenesis (Teng et al.,
2010).

CLONING

Using microarray analysis to identify genes downregulated in testis of
men with spermatocyte maturation arrest (see 270960) or Sertoli
cell-only syndrome (see 400042), followed by database analysis, Lin et
al. (2006) identified LRWD1. The deduced 647-amino acid protein contains
a leucine-rich repeat domain and a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat
domain. RT-PCR of 8 human tissues detected LRWD1 expression in testis
only. Similar expression was detected in adult mouse. In mouse testis,
Lrwd1 expression began at postnatal day 35.

Teng et al. (2010) cloned mouse Lrwd1 from a testis cDNA library. The
deduced 648-amino acid protein has an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat
region and 4 C-terminal WD40 domains. Mouse and human LRWD1 share 81.4%
amino acid identity. Northern and Western blot analyses detected Lrwd1
in mouse testis only. The apparent molecular mass of the protein was
about 71 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse testis showed
cytoplasmic Lrwd1 staining in spermatocytes and spermatids. In
spermatozoa, Lrwd1 concentrated in the head-neck region, where the
centrosome is located. Even in mature spermatozoa, Lrwd1 retained its
localization in the head-neck region following loss of an identifiable
centrosome. In a mouse spermatocyte cell line, Lrwd1 colocalized with
gamma-tubulin (see 191135) in the centrosomal region throughout the cell
cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis of mouse spermatocytes,
Teng et al. (2010) found that Lrwd1 interacted directly with
gamma-tubulin.

Initiation of DNA replication requires the assembly of a prereplication
complex (pre-RC) in late mitosis and G1, with sequential loading of the
origin recognition complex (see ORC1; 601902), CDC6 (602627), CDT1
(605525), and the MCM2-7 complex (see MCM2; 116945) onto replication
origins. Upon initiation of DNA replication, the pre-RC is disassembled,
and CDT1 and CDC6 are released from the origins to prevent
rereplication. Using human cell lines, Shen et al. (2012) showed that
LRWD1, which they called ORCA, was required for pre-RC assembly and
replication initiation. Knockdown of ORCA via small interfering RNA
reduced association of ORC and MCM2-7 with chromatin and caused failure
of cell cycle progression through S phase. ORCA associated dynamically
with different pre-RC components during the cell cycle: it associated
with ORC and CDT1 at G1, with ORC(2-5) and the CDT1 inhibitor geminin
(GMNN; 602842) in S phase, and with ORC(2-5), phosphorylated CDT1, and
phosphorylated geminin during mitosis. ORCA interacted directly with
ORC2 (601182), CDT1, and geminin, and ORC2 was required for ORCA
stability. Overexpression of geminin reduced the affinity of CDT1 for
ORCA, and loss of association between ORCA and CDT1 appeared to be a key
step in disassembling the pre-RC at the end of G1 phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin et al. (2006) determined that the LRWD1 gene contains at least 14
exons and spans about 8.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lin et al. (2006) mapped the LRWD1 gene to
chromosome 7q22.1. They mapped the mouse Lrwd1 gene to chromosome 5G2.

TASTE RECEPTOR, FAMILY B, MEMBER 1; TRB1
DESCRIPTION For background information on the TAS2R gene family, see 604791.

CLONING

Matsunami et al. (2000) used in silico methods to identify a family of
candidate taste receptors that are members of the G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) superfamily and that are specifically expressed in taste
receptor cells. Using the TRB2 sequence to search the human chromosome
12 database, Matsunami et al. (2000) identified TRB1 and 7 other related
genes, all in the same contig. Two of these were pseudogenes. Matsunami
et al. (2000) identified the TRB7 gene (604796) in a contig assigned to
human chromosome 5p15, the location of PROP (171200), the genetic locus
that governs the ability of humans to taste 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil, a
bitter compound. Matsunami et al. (2000) also identified 5 TRB genes (1
a pseudogene) on 3 chromosome 7 contigs, 2 of which are assigned to
7q31-q32. All TRB genes have the 7 transmembrane domain structure
characteristic of GPCRs, but lack a long extracellular N-terminal domain
proposed to bind ligand, suggesting that they use a different mode of
ligand binding. Matsunami et al. (2000) concluded that the TRBs are
diverse in protein sequence, which is consistent with an ability to
detect a variety of tastants with very different chemical structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Kinnamon (2000) reviewed the role of taste receptors in taste
transduction.

Deshpande et al. (2010) found that bitter taste receptor agonists evoked
increased intracellular calcium in cultured human airway smooth muscle
(ASM) cells at levels comparable to GPCR agonists, such as bradykinin
and histamine. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected multiple TAS2R
transcripts in ASM cells, with highest expression of TAS2R10 (604791),
TAS2R14, and TAS2R31 (612669), intermediate expression of TAS2R5
(605062), TAS2R4 (604869), and TAS2R19 (613961), and detectable
expression of 11 other TAS2Rs, with results normalized for expression of
ADRB2 (109690). Expression of 8 other TAS2Rs and TAS1R1 (606225) and
TAS1R2 (606226) was undetectable. Using isolated intact mouse airways,
Deshpande et al. (2010) observed dose-dependent relaxation in response
to bitter taste receptor agonists, such as chloroquine, denatorium, and
quinine, after challenge with contracting agents, such as acetylcholine
or serotonin. Magnet twisting cytometry showed that isolated ASM cells
challenged with histamine relaxed after treatment with bitter taste
receptor agonists. Bitter taste receptor agonists were a more effective
treatment than albuterol in a mouse model of allergic airway
inflammation. Deshpande et al. (2010) proposed that agents that bind
bitter taste receptors and cause bronchodilation may provide an
alternative and/or supplement to beta agonist for the treatment of
asthma.

GENE FAMILY

Adler et al. (2000) identified members of a family of 40 to 80 human and
rodent GPCRs expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue
and palate epithelia. These candidate taste receptors, which the authors
called T2Rs, are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically
linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. Each
T2R gene encodes a 7-transmembrane receptor protein. The amino acid
sequence identities between human and mouse T2Rs range from 46 to 67%.
The authors determined that a single taste receptor cell expresses a
large repertoire of T2Rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of
recognizing multiple tastants. In situ hybridization demonstrated that
T2Rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the
G protein subunit gustducin (139395), implying that they function as
gustducin-linked receptors.

Chandrashekar et al. (2006) reviewed the receptors and cells for
mammalian taste.

MAPPING

Matsunami et al. (2000) identified the TAS2R14 gene on chromosome 12p13.

Adler et al. (2000) identified T2R14, which is identical to the TRB1
gene reported by Matsunami et al. (2000), in a BAC clone from 12p13.

;;DELTA SLEEP-INDUCING PEPTIDE, IMMUNOREACTOR; DSIPI;;
GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED LEUCINE ZIPPER; GILZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Drosophila 'shortsighted' (shs) protein, which is necessary for
photoreceptor differentiation, is a homolog of the mouse
TGF-beta-1-inducible protein Tsc22 (607715). Both of these proteins, as
well as the porcine protein DIP (DSIP-immunoreactive peptide), are
leucine zipper proteins that lack an N-terminal basic DNA-binding
region. Vogel et al. (1996) screened a human fetal brain cDNA library
with a porcine DIP cDNA fragment and isolated a 420-bp cDNA that encodes
a predicted 122-amino acid protein. The putative DSIPI protein exhibits
high identity with porcine DIP, differing in just 4 positions. Sequence
comparisons revealed a highly conserved leucine zipper region in DSIPI,
Tsc22, and shs. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated widespread distribution of
the DSIPI protein among various human tissues.

Using mouse Gilz to screen a human T-lymphocyte cDNA library, Cannarile
et al. (2001) cloned full-length GILZ. The deduced 135-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 15 kD. GILZ contains a
leucine zipper, a C-terminal proline-rich and acidic region, an
N-glycosylation site, and several sites for threonine and serine
phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis detected highest GILZ expression
in brain, lung, spleen, skeletal muscle, and in all hematopoietic cell
lineages examined. Lower expression was found in heart and kidney, and
no expression was found in liver and pancreas. Western blot analysis
found complete concordance between mRNA and protein expression,
suggesting that GILZ expression is regulated at the transcriptional
level.

GENE FUNCTION

Cannarile et al. (2001) found that expression of GILZ increased in human
peripheral blood leukocytes, monocytes, and CD3 (see 186740)-positive
cells following dexamethasone treatment.

Berrebi et al. (2003) found that mouse and human macrophages produced
GILZ in noninflamed tissues, and production by macrophages was
stimulated by glucocorticoids and by IL10 (124092), both in vitro and in
vivo. In addition, GILZ inhibited the expression of Toll-like receptors
(TLRs; see 601194) and molecules involved in antigen presentation and
inflammation. GILZ expression was downregulated in macrophages from
inflammatory lesions of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, whereas
it persisted in tumor-infiltrating macrophages from Burkitt lymphomas
(113970).

GILZ appears to modulate the response of T lymphocytes to stimulation of
the T-cell receptor (TCR). Overexpression of GILZ in a murine lymphoid
cell line inhibited anti-CD3-induced apoptosis via downregulation of FAS
(134637)/FASL (134638) expression and also significantly affected
interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production and expression of IL2 receptor
(IL2R; 147730) (Ayroldi et al., 2001). GILZ may exert its effects by
interfering at various stages of the signaling pathways that are
triggered by TCR stimulation. Interleukin-2 withdrawal is a physiologic
process inducing cell death in activated T lymphocytes. Asselin-Labat et
al. (2004) reported that IL2 deprivation leads to expression of GILZ in
T lymphocytes. They characterized the GILZ promoter and showed that
forkhead box class O3 (FOXO3; 602681) binding to the foxhead responsive
elements identified in the promoter is necessary for induction of GILZ
expression when IL2 is withdrawn. GILZ overexpression protected CTLL2
cells from IL2 withdrawal-induced apoptosis, whereas cell death was
accelerated in cells unable to express GILZ. These and other experiments
indicated that GILZ is a transiently expressed protein induced upon IL2
withdrawal that protects T cells from the onset of apoptosis.

Ayroldi et al. (2007) demonstrated that Gilz interacted directly with
Ras (HRAS; 190020) in vitro and in vivo as shown by Gilz and Ras
coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization upon phorbol ester activation
in primary mouse spleen T lymphocytes and thymus cells. Analysis of Gilz
mutants showed that they bound Ras through the TSC box, and depending on
the Ras activation levels, formed a trimeric complex with Ras and Raf
(RAF1; 164760). As a consequence of these interactions, Gilz diminished
activation of Ras and Raf downstream targets, leading to inhibition of
Ras- and Raf-dependent cell proliferation and Ras-induced mouse
fibroblast transformation. Gilz silencing resulted in an increase in
concanavalin A-induced T cell proliferation and inhibition of
dexamethasone antiproliferative effects. Ayroldi et al. (2007) concluded
that GILZ is a negative regulator of RAS- and RAF-induced proliferation
and is a mediator of the antiproliferative effects of glucocorticoids.

MAPPING

By FISH, Cannarile et al. (2001) mapped the DSIPI gene to chromosome
Xq22.2.

;;TSA2;;
MALE MEIOTIC METAPHASE CHROMOSOME-ASSOCIATED ACIDIC PROTEIN; MEICHROACIDIN;;
TESTIS-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 2; TSGA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RSPH1 gene is the homolog of the Chlamydomonas radial spoke head 1
gene, which encodes a protein that localizes to cilia and flagella
(summary by Kott et al., 2013).

CLONING

Tsuchida et al. (1998) cloned the mouse Tsa2 gene, which they called
meichroacidin, from a testis cDNA library. The deduced 284-amino acid
protein has an acidic N terminus, followed by 6 repeat sequences, a
7-glutamic acid sequence, a short hydrophobic region, and an acidic C
terminus. It also contains several potential phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest
expression in testis, with much lower expression in ovary, and no
expression in any other tissue examined. Tsa2 was expressed in neonatal
mouse testis beginning at day 12, and high expression was detected in
testis from day 14 to adult. Western blot analysis detected Tsa2 at an
apparent molecular mass of 40 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated
that Tsa2 was expressed in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes
through to round spermatids. However, during the disappearance of the
nuclear envelope at both the first and second meiotic divisions, Tsa2
localized around metaphase chromosomes and spindles.

By quantitative RT-PCR, Kott et al. (2013) found expression of human
RSPH1 in tissues with motile cilia or flagella, including the trachea,
lungs, airway brushings, and testes. Expression of RSPH1 was similar to
that of other radial spoke-head proteins, such as RSPH4A (612647). RSPH1
localized to the cilia in nasal brushings.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TSGA2
gene to chromosome 21 (TMAP SHGC-30133).

By interspecific backcross analysis, Taketo et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Tsa2 gene to the proximal region of chromosome 17.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 12 patients from 10 families with primary ciliary dyskinesia-24
without situs inversus (CILD24; 615481), Kott et al. (2013) identified 7
biallelic mutations in the RSPH1 gene (see, e.g.,
609314.0001-609314.0005). The mutation in the first patient was found by
a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing. The
subsequent mutations were found in patients from a larger cohort of 36
families with CILD characterized by ciliary central microtubule complex
and radial spoke defects. Respiratory cilia from 1 affected individual
showed undetectable RSPH1 protein, consistent with a loss of function.
Overall, RSPH1 mutations accounted for 20.8% of the 48 families studied
with this specific phenotype. Kott et al. (2013) noted that patients
with RSPH1 mutations do not have situs inversus because central complex
defects do not affect the 9+0 structure of embryonic nodal cilia.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 24, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
RSPH1, GLU29TER (dbSNP 138320978)

In a girl of North African descent, born of consanguineous parents, with
primary ciliary dyskinesia-24 without situs inversus (CILD24; 615481),
Kott et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.85G-T transversion in exon
2 of the RSPH1 gene, resulting in a glu29-to-ter (E29X) substitution.
The mutation was found by homozygosity mapping combined with whole-exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing; DNA from the parents was
not available. The variant (dbSNP rs138320978) was found at a low
frequency (0.00038) in the Exome Variant Server database, but was not
found in homozygous state in 2,276 control individuals. This low
frequency was compatible with the expected frequency of a CILD allele.
Screening for RSPH1 mutations in 36 additional families with CILD and
central complex defects identified another male patient of North African
descent who was homozygous for the E29X mutation as well as 3 additional
patients of European descent who were compound heterozygous for E29X and
another pathogenic mutation in the RSPH1 gene (see, e.g., 609314.0002
and 609324.0005). All patients had early onset of sinopulmonary
infections and some had infertility; none had situs inversus.

.0002

RSPH1, IVS4AS, C-A, -3

In 2 unrelated male patients of European descent with CILD24 without
situs inversus (615481), Kott et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for a C-to-A transversion in intron 4 of the RSPH1 gene
(c.366-3C-A) and another pathogenic mutation (E29X; 609314.0001 and
407_410delAGTA; 609314.0003, respectively). The c.366-3C-A mutation was
not found in the dbSNP, Ensembl, or Exome Variant Server databases. It
occurred at a highly conserved nucleotide and was predicted to affect
splicing. The 4-bp deletion (c.407delAGTA) was predicted to result in
premature termination (Lys136MetfsTer6).

In 5 patients from 3 European families with CILD24 without situs
inversus (615481), Kott et al. (2013) identified a homozygous A-to-C
transversion in intron 3 of the RSPH1 gene (c.275-2A-C). RT-PCR showed
that the mutation leads to the skipping of exons 4 and 5 and results in
premature termination (Gly92AlafsTer10). Another patient was compound
heterozygous for this splice site mutation and another pathogenic
mutation. The c.275-2A-C mutation was present in dbSNP (dbSNP
rs151107532) and at a low frequency (0.001) in the Exome Variant Server
database, which is compatible with the expected frequency of a CILD
allele. The homozygous genotype was not found among 2,937 individuals.

In a patient with CILD24 without situs inversus (615481), Kott et al.

exon 4 of the RSPH1 gene, resulting in a gly103-to-asp (G103D)
substitution at a highly conserved residue, and E29X (609314.0001). The
G103D mutation was not found in the Exome Variant Server, Ensembl, or
dbSNP databases.

613357	TITLE *613357 FIBRINOGEN C DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; FIBCD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FIBCD1 is a conserved type II transmembrane endocytic receptor that
binds chitin and is located primarily in the intestinal brush border
(Schlosser et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching databases for L-ficolin (FCN2; 601624) homologs that might
bind acetyl groups, Schlosser et al. (2009) identified human FIBCD1. The
predicted 461-amino acid protein has a 31-amino acid cytoplasmic tail at
its N terminus, followed by a 23-amino acid transmembrane helix and a
408-amino acid ectodomain. The cytoplasmic tail has 2 potential
phosphorylation sites. The ectodomain contains an acetyl group-binding
fibrinogen (see 134820)-related domain (FRED) and sequences with
homology to coiled-coil regions of myosins (see 601478) and
angiopoietins (see 601667). FIBCD1 shares significant homology with
FCN2, M-ficolin (FCN1; 601252), and horseshoe crab tachylectin-5A
(Tl5a). When expressed in HEK293 cells as a secreted protein, the FIBCD1
ectodomain had a molecular mass of 55 kD in the reduced state and 250 kD
in the unreduced state by SDS-PAGE, and chemical cross-linking
experiments showed that it formed disulfide-linked homotetramers. FACS
analysis and confocal microscopy of transfected Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells showed cell surface localization of full-length FIBCD1.
RT-PCR detected FIBCD1 mRNA in nearly all human tissues examined.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissues demonstrated high
expression of FIBCD1 in small and large intestine epithelial cells on
the apical surface corresponding to the brush border and in salivary
gland ducts. Little to no expression was detected in stomach epithelial
cells, respiratory cells, and urogenital epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using ELISA and fluorescence microscopy analysis, Schlosser et al.
(2009) showed that human FIBCD1 could bind to and mediate uptake of
acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a manner that depended on
calcium or manganese, but not magnesium. Pull-down analysis revealed
that FIBCD1 bound chitin, but not other pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs). Schlosser et al. (2009) concluded that FIBCD1 is a
membrane-bound FRED molecule that binds chitin.

By chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy analyses, Thomsen et
al. (2010) showed that FIBCD1 FREDs formed noncovalent tetramers
independent of the coiled-coil. Using surface plasmon resonance and
pull-down assays with mutation analysis, they found that the central
residues in the hydrophobic funnel were necessary for binding of FIBCD1
to acetylated BSA and chitin. Thomsen et al. (2010) concluded that
FIBCD1 FREDs form noncovalent tetramers with an acetyl-binding site
homologous to those of Tl5a and FCN1, but not to that of FCN2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schlosser et al. (2009) determined that the FIBCD1 gene contains 7 exons
and spans 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Schlosser et al. (2009) mapped the FIBCD1
gene to chromosome 9q34.12-q34.13.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), such as ZNF208, bind DNA and, through this
binding, regulate gene transcription. Most ZNFs contain conserved C2H2
motifs and are classified as Kruppel-type zinc fingers. A conserved
protein motif, termed the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, mediates
protein-protein interactions (Eichler et al., 1998). See ZNF91 (603971)

Using probes derived from a ZNF91 cDNA to screen a pool of human
chromosome 19-specific cosmids that had hybridized to a degenerate
oligonucleotide corresponding to the H/C link region, Bellefroid et al.
(1993) isolated the genes of several distinct ZNF91 subfamily members,
including ZNF208, which they called ZNF95. They found that ZNF91-related
genes were widely expressed in human tissues, with highest expression in
T-lymphoid cells.

Using a combined approach of FISH, STS markers, and conversion of
overlapping sets of YAC genomic clones, Eichler et al. (1998) identified
and cloned ZNF208. The full-length transcript predicts a 1,317-amino
acid protein consisting of 2 KRAB protein-interacting domains and 41 ZNF
(28-amino acid) repeats. A splice variant, resulting from the use of an
alternative polyadenylation signal, predicts a 77-amino acid peptide
consisting only of the KRAB protein-interacting domains. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of both transcripts in all tissues
examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eichler et al. (1998) determined that the ZNF208 gene contains 3 exons,
1 for each KRAB domain and a single large exon that incorporates the ZNF
DNA-binding domain.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bellefroid et al. (1993) mapped a YAC clone containing the
ZNF208 gene to chromosome 19p13.1-p12. By sequence analysis, Eichler et
al. (1998) mapped the ZNF208 gene within a cluster of ZNF genes on
chromosome 19p12.

;;TRIM9-LIKE; TNL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences encoding RBCC (N-terminal RING
finger/B-box/coiled-coil) proteins, Short and Cox (2006) identified
TRIM67, which they called TNL. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal RING finger domain, 2 B-boxes, a coiled-coil region, a COS
box, an FN3 domain, and a B30.2 domain. TRIM67 shares 65% amino acid
identity with TRIM9 (606555).

GENE STRUCTURE

Short and Cox (2006) determined that the TRIM67 gene contains 12 exons
and spans about 53 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Short and Cox (2006) mapped the TRIM67
gene to chromosome 1q42.

610123	TITLE *610123 5-@HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE RECEPTOR 3, SUBUNIT E; HTR3E
;;SEROTONIN 5-HT-3E RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION For background information on the serotonin (5-HT) receptor gene family,
see 182131.

CLONING

The serotonin receptor 5-HT3 is an oligomeric complex composed of 5
subunits. Using BLAST analysis with a consensus sequence derived from
HTR3A (182139) and HTR3B (604654), Niesler et al. (2003) identified and
subsequently cloned 2 novel homologous genes, HTR3D and HTR3E. The HTR3E
gene encodes a predicted protein of 471 amino acids including a 16-amino
acid signal sequence, 4 transmembrane domains, and several potential
glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. Sequence comparisons showed
that HTR3C, HTR3D, and HTR3E share amino acid sequence identities of
64.8 to 74.3%; multiple sequence alignments suggested that HTR3C
(610121), HTR3D (610122), and HTR3E share a common evolutionary history,
whereas HTR3A and HTR3B are evolutionarily more distant. RT-PCR analysis
showed HTR3E expression only in adult colon and intestine.

Karnovsky et al. (2003) identified HTR3E and showed using RT-PCR that 2
alternative first exons are used, encoding predicted proteins of either
456 or 471 amino acids. HTR3E contains 6 proline residues necessary for
normal 5-HT3 receptor function. RT-PCR showed very strong expression in
small intestine and weak expression in spinal cord and retina. HTR3E is
also expressed in the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines SW480
and differentiated Caco-2. Southern blot analyses of zooblots showed
HTR3E hybridization to human, dog, cow, pig, rabbit, and chicken genomic
DNA, but not to mouse or rat genomic DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in situ hybridization, Kapeller et al. (2008) observed
colocalization of HTR3E with microRNA-510 (MIR510; 610123) in
enterocytes of colonic mucosa and in myenteric plexus. They identified
an MIR510-binding site in the 3-prime UTR of the HTR3E gene. Following
transfection of Colo320 cells, MIR510 downregulated expression of a
reporter gene that included the HTR3E 3-prime UTR in a dose-dependent
manner. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that MIR510 binding did not
affect the stability of HTR3E mRNA, suggesting that MIR510 repressed
HTR3E expression at the translational level.

GENE STRUCTURE

Karnovsky et al. (2003) reported that the HTR3E gene contains 9 exons
spanning at least 7.7 kb. They also found an additional alternative
first exon that includes exon 2 and 112 nucleotides between exons 1 and
2.

MAPPING

Niesler et al. (2003) mapped the HTR3E gene to chromosome 3q27 by FISH.
PCR and hybridization analysis showed that HTR3E, HTR3C, and HTR3D form
a cluster and map within a 100-kb region.

602972	TITLE *602972 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 8A; PDE8A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the intracellular levels of cAMP and
cGMP. These cyclic nucleotides play an important role as second
messengers in multiple physiologic processes, including regulation of
vascular resistance, cardiac output, visceral motility, immune response,
inflammation, neuroplasticity, vision, and reproduction. PDEs comprise a
large superfamily of enzymes divided into 10 families. Different PDEs
can be distinguished by their structure, tissue expression,
localization, substrate specificity, regulation, and sensitivity to PDE
inhibitors. Diversity in structure and specificity of function make PDEs
promising targets for the pharmacotherapy of diseases modulated by
cyclic nucleotide signaling (Hetman et al., 2000). See 171885.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for clones with homology to the catalytic
domain of PDE4B (600127), Fisher et al. (1998) identified apparently
partial cDNAs encoding 713 amino acids of a novel PDE. Sequence
comparisons revealed that the predicted catalytic domain shared only 20
to 39% sequence identity with those of 7 previously identified PDE
families. Therefore, the authors designated the protein PDE8A. Using
Northern blots, Fisher et al. (1998) determined that PDE8A is expressed
as an approximately 4.5-kb mRNA in a wide variety of tissues. A
recombinant protein containing the 545 C-terminal amino acids of PDE8A
displayed very high affinity cAMP-specific PDE activity. Unlike PDE4 and
PDE7, the other high affinity cAMP-specific PDEs, PDE8A was not
inhibited by IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine).

Wang et al. (2001) cloned 5 PDE8A splice variants from testis and normal
human T-cell cDNA libraries. The variants, called PDE8A1 through PDE8A5,
share a common 5-prime sequence but differ from each other by the
presence or absence of exons 7 through 9. Full-length PDE8A protein,
which they called PDE8A1, has has 829 amino acids and a calculated
molecular mass of 93.3 kD. It has an N-terminal REC domain and PAS
domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. It also contains several sites
for protein phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, N-myristoylation, and
amidation. Mouse Pde8a1 contains a nuclear localization sequence not
found in human PDE8A1. PDE8A2 contains 783 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 88.3 kD. PDE8A3 contains 449 amino acids
and has a calculated molecular mass of 51.3 kD, and PDE8A4 and PDE8A5
encode identical 582-amino acid proteins with a calculated molecular
mass of 66.0 kD. The isoforms differ from each other in the deletion or
insertion of sequences in the PAS domains; PDE8A3 lacks the entire PAS
domain. Only PDE8A1 and PDE8A2 were evaluated for tissue distribution.
Real-time quantitative PCR detected both transcripts in all human
tissues examined with expression levels of PDE8A1 much higher than that
of PDE8A2. PDE8A1 and PDE8A2 showed highest expression in testis and
spleen, respectively, and both showed lowest expression in skeletal
muscle and bone marrow. By in situ hybridization of mouse testis, Vasta
et al. (2006) showed Pde8a was expressed specifically in Leydig cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2001) determined that the PDE8A gene contains 23 exons and
spans over 80 kb. The 5-prime region of the PDE8A is GC-rich, and it
contains a TATA box and numerous transcription factor binding sites,
including some involved in cAMP-responsive transcriptional regulation
and in expression of genes in T cells.

MAPPING

Wang et al. (2001) noted that the PDE8A gene maps to chromosome
15q25.3-q26.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Vasta et al. (2006) showed that knockdown of Pde8a in mice altered
luteinizing hormone (LH; see LHB 152780) signaling and steroidogenesis.
In Pde8a-knockout Leydig cells, they found a 4-fold increase in
sensitivity to LH for testosterone production. They concluded that PDE8A
plays a role in setting the sensitivity to LH for testosterone
production

SISTER CHROMATID COHESION 2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SCC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sister chromatids remain connected following duplication in S phase
until they segregate during anaphase of mitosis or meiosis II. This
cohesion counteracts the force of spindle microtubules on sister
kinetochores and allows chromosomes to align at the mitotic spindle.
Sister chromatid cohesion is also essential for segregation of
homologous chromosomes during meiosis I and for repair of DNA
double-strand breaks during G2 phase. Cohesin (see 606462) is a protein
complex required for sister chromatid cohesion. NIPBL forms a dimer with
MAU2 (614560) that is essential for loading the cohesin complex onto
sister chromatids (Watrin et al., 2006).

CLONING

In the course of searching for the molecular basis of the Cornelia de
Lange syndrome (CDLS; 122470), Tonkin et al. (2004) and Krantz et al.
(2004) analyzed de novo balanced translocations associated with Cornelia
de Lange syndrome and identified a novel gene at 5p13.1 that is
disrupted in these cases. Tonkin et al. (2004) designated the product of
the Nipped-B-like (NIPBL) gene 'delangin.' The coding sequence commences
in exon 2 and continues either to exon 47, generating a long isoform
(2,804 amino acids), or to an expanded variant of exon 46, generating a
slightly shorter isoform (2,697 amino acids). Residues 1 through 2,683
of the short and long isoforms are identical; the short isoform contains
a 14-amino acid C-terminal end that is unrelated to the 121-amino acid
C-terminal end of the long isoform (Tonkin et al., 2004). Northern blot
analysis showed that NIPBL is strongly expressed in fetal and adult
kidney, fetal liver, adult placenta, heart, skeletal muscle, and thymus,
but weakly or almost undetectably expressed in fetal and adult brain and
lung and in adult liver, colon, small intestine, and leukocytes (Tonkin
et al., 2004). Tonkin et al. (2004) found that vertebrate delangins have
substantial homology to orthologs in flies, worms, plants, and fungi,
including Scc2-type sister chromatid cohesion proteins, and D.
melanogaster Nipped-B.

Using bioinformatic analysis, Yan et al. (2006) showed that NIPBL
protein contains an N-terminal caldesmon (CALD1; 114213) domain, a
calponin (CNN1; 600806) domain, and 2 calmodulin (CALM1; 114180)-binding
motifs, followed by a nuclear localization signal, a nuclear export
signal, 5 HEAT repeats, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain.

GENE FUNCTION

In situ hybridization to whole mouse embryos detected Nipbl transcripts
at gestation days 9.5 and 10.5, with notable accumulations in limb bud,
branchial arch, and craniofacial mesenchyme (Krantz et al., 2004). In
situ hybridization to human embryonic tissue sections revealed an
expression pattern largely consistent with the CDLS phenotype (Tonkin et
al., 2004). Krantz et al. (2004) found evidence for alternative splicing
of the NIPBL gene in the presence of multiple transcripts detected on
Northern blot analysis.

The evolution of an ancestral sister chromatid cohesion protein to
acquire an additional role in developmental gene regulation suggested to
Tonkin et al. (2004) that there are parallels between CDLS and Roberts
syndrome (268300), which is characterized by growth retardation, limb
reduction defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and premature centromere
separation. A dual role for Nipped-B in sister chromatid cohesion and
developmental regulation was confirmed by Rollins et al. (2004).

By metaphase spread analysis, Kaur et al. (2005) found evidence of
precocious sister chromatid separation (PSCS) in 37 (41%) of 90 probands
with CDLS compared to 8 (9%) of controls. Of the 37 CDLS patients with
PSCS, 16 (43%) had mutations in the NIPBL gene, whereas 21 (57%) did
not. Both severe and mild phenotypes were seen in those with PSCS and
those without PSCS. Kaur et al. (2005) noted that Roberts syndrome
(268300), which has phenotypic overlap with CDLS and is associated with
premature sister chromatid separation, is caused by mutations in the
ESCO2 gene (609353), which is required for proper establishment of the
sister chromatid cohesion complex.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Watrin et al. (2006) showed that
SCC4 (MAU2) interacted with SCC2 in HeLa cell nucleoplasmic extracts.
SCC4 and SCC2 cosedimented in fractionated HeLa cell extracts and
colocalized on chromatin in HeLa cells during interphase and telophase.
Depletion of either SCC4 or SCC2 via small interfering RNA delayed
mitotic exit and caused loss of cohesin from chromatin during interphase
and telophase, precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion,
misalignment of chromosomes, appearance of single sister chromatids, and
prometaphase arrest. Knockdown of either SCC4 or SCC2 also reduced the
amount of the other protein, suggesting that physical association
between them is required for stability. Chromosomes in SCC4- or
SCC2-depleted cells lacked cohesin despite the presence of the cohesin
protectors SGO1 (SGOL1; 609168) and BUB1 (602452).

Independently, Seitan et al. (2006) showed that MAU2
coimmunoprecipitated with delangin. Drosophila and Xenopus orthologs of
MAU2 and delangin also interacted directly. Protein truncation and yeast
2-hybrid analyses revealed that the N termini of MAU2 and delangin
mediated their interaction. Knockdown of MAU2 in HeLa cells resulted in
increased frequency of precocious sister chromatid separation. In
control cells, release from block in G2/M resulted in rapid loading of
cohesin subunits onto chromatin. In MAU2 knockdown cells, cohesin
complexes formed, but they failed to load onto chromatin.

Kagey et al. (2010) reported that Mediator (see MED8, 607956) and
cohesin (see SMC1, 300040) physically and functionally connect the
enhancers and core promoters of active genes in murine embryonic stem
cells. Mediator, a transcriptional coactivator, forms a complex with
cohesin, which can form rings that connect 2 DNA segments. The
cohesin-loading factor NIPBL is associated with Mediator-cohesin
complexes, providing a means to load cohesin at promoters. DNA looping
is observed between the enhancers and promoters occupied by Mediator and
cohesin. Mediator and cohesin co-occupy different promoters in different
cells, thus generating cell type-specific DNA loops linked to the gene
expression program of each cell.

GENE STRUCTURE

The NIPBL gene contains 47 exons spanning 188 kb, with commencement of
the coding sequence in exon 2 (Krantz et al., 2004; Tonkin et al.,
2004).

MAPPING

Krantz et al. (2004) and Tonkin et al. (2004) identified the NIPBL gene
within chromosome 5p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tonkin et al. (2004) studied CDLS cases without translocations and
identified 9 plausible point mutations, at least 5 of which arose de
novo. As they found NIPBL mutations in individuals with severe and mild
CDLS, phenotypic variation may be explained in part by allelic
heterogeneity. The spectrum and distribution of mutations implied that
pathogenesis arose from loss or altered function of a single NIPBL
allele. The mutation detection rate in the study of Tonkin et al. (2004)
was approximately 50%. Thus, locus heterogeneity as well as allelic
heterogeneity may be present, but limitations of the screening methods
were also cited as a plausible explanation for the comparatively low
mutation detection rate. On the other hand, considerable intrafamilial
variation in phenotype of CDLS, even between affected sibs
(Krajewska-Walasek et al., 1995), suggests that additional factors may
be important. Tonkin et al. (2004) proposed that perturbed delangin
function may inappropriately activate distal-less homeobox (DLX) genes,
thereby contributing to the proximodistal limb patterning defects in
CDLS.

Krantz et al. (2004) identified 6 point mutations in individuals with
CDLS (608667.0001-608667.0006). All were expected to result in a
truncated or, in the case of the met1-to-lys mutation (M1K;
608667.0001), an untranslated protein.

Gillis et al. (2004) described the spectrum and distribution of NIPBL
mutations in a large well-characterized cohort of individuals with CDLS.
In 56 (47%) of 120 unrelated individuals with sporadic or familial CDLS,
they identified mutations in the NIPBL gene (see
608667.0007-608667.0012). In 49 (46%) of the 106 individuals with
sporadic CDLS, 44 different mutations were identified, 14 (32%) of which
were small deletions. In 6 the 7 familial cases of CDLS in which NIPBL
mutations were identified, germline mosaicism was considered the likely
mechanism for the occurrence of affected sibs with mutation-negative
parents.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Gillis et al. (2004) found statistically significant phenotypic
differences between mutation-positive and mutation-negative individuals
with CDLS. Analysis also suggested a trend toward a milder phenotype in
individuals with missense mutations.

Yan et al. (2006) identified 13 different NIPBL mutations, including 11
novel mutations, in 13 (46%) of 28 Polish patients with a clinical
diagnosis of CDLS. Eleven of the mutations resulted in a premature
termination of the protein. Mutation-positive patients were more
severely affected than mutation-negative patients with respect to
prenatal growth, facial dysmorphism, and speech impairment.

from whom samples were available. All 3 sibs, ages 17, 8, and 3 years,

NIPBL, IVS44DS, A-G, +4

In affected members of a family with CDLS (122470) previously described
by Krantz et al. (2004), Gillis et al. (2004) identified a 7321A-G
transition at position +4 of exon 43 of the NIPBL gene. The mutation was
identified in 2 of 4 affected sibs from whom samples were available, as
well as in the mildly affected mother.

CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, ARG1536TER

In 3 unrelated patients with sporadic CDLS (122470), Gillis et al.
(2004) identified an arg1536-to-ter (R1536X) substitution in exon 22 of
the NIPBL gene.

.0013
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 2-BP DEL/1-BP INS

Borck et al. (2006) screened 21 CDLS (122470) patients with no
previously identified NIPBL anomaly for mutations in the 5-prime
untranslated region and the proximal promoter of the NIPBL gene. They
identified a heterozygous deletion-insertion mutation in exon 1, 321
nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon
(-321_-320delCCinsA) in an affected girl and her mildly affected father.
The CC dinucleotide and the surrounding sequence are highly conserved in
mammalian NIPBL homologs. The deletion-insertion variant was not
identified in either parent of the father. The affected child was the
first offspring of parents who were related as second cousins
originating from Algeria. The diagnosis was made in the neonatal period
because of characteristic dysmorphic facial features. The father had had
feeding problems and gastroesophageal reflux in infancy, as did the
proband. He also had developmental delay and speech delay, with his
first words spoken at age 3 years, 6 months. At 7 years of age he was
operated on for subvalvular aortic stenosis. He had growth retardation
with a final height of 152 cm. The heights of his father and mother were
168 cm and 152 cm, respectively. Dysmorphic features in the father
included arched eyebrows with synophrys, long eyelashes, long nose, and
thin upper lip.

601746	TITLE *601746 HYPOXIA UP-REGULATED 1; HYOU1
;;OXYGEN-REGULATED PROTEIN, 150-KD; ORP150
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Astrocytes retain cell viability, even in extreme ischemia, and
proliferate in damaged brain (Petito et al., 1990; Janeczko, 1991). Rat
astrocytes exposed to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation were reported to
release increased amounts of interleukin-6 (147620) that could promote
neuronal survival in ischemic brain (Maeda et al., 1994). Kuwabara et
al. (1996) observed a 150-kD protein, called oxygen-regulated protein
(ORP150) by them, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cultured
astrocytes that was induced specifically by hypoxia and not by other
stimuli.

Ikeda et al. (1997) reported the cloning of human and rat ORP150 cDNAs
from hypoxia-treated human astrocytoma U373 cells and rat astrocytes,
respectively. The full-length 4,503-bp human cDNA contains a 2,997-bp
open reading frame predicted to encode a polypeptide of 999 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 111,330 Da. The deduced amino acid
sequences of human and rat ORP150 exhibit high similarity (over 90%
identity) to each other. The first 32 residues represent the signal
peptide necessary for secretion. The C-terminal KNDEL sequence resembles
KDEL, a motif found in ER-resident proteins, suggesting that ORP150
resides in the ER. The N-terminal half of ORP150 has a modest similarity
to the ATPase domain of numerous HSP70 family sequences (see 140550).
Northern blot analysis revealed a marked similarity of expression
between ORP150 and GRP78 (138120) in U373 cells during hypoxia stress.
(The GRP78 protein is produced in cultured rat astrocytes exposed to
hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation.) They also found that ORP150 mRNA was
highly expressed in the liver and pancreas, whereas little expression
was observed in the kidney and brain, similarly to the expression
pattern of GRP78. Ikeda et al. (1997) proposed that ORP150 plays an
important role in protein folding and secretion in the ER, perhaps as a
molecular chaperone in concert with other GRPs, to cope with
environmental stress.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HYOU1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP stSG31085).

GENE FUNCTION

Tamatani et al. (2001) found that although ORP150 was sparingly
upregulated in neurons from human brain undergoing ischemic stress,
there was robust induction in astrocytes. Cultured neurons
overexpressing ORP150 were resistant to hypoxemic stress, whereas
astrocytes with inhibited ORP150 expression were more vulnerable. Mice
with targeted neuronal overexpression of ORP150 had smaller strokes
compared with controls. Neurons with increased ORP150 demonstrated
suppressed caspase-3-like activity and enhanced brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (113505) under hypoxia signaling. Tamatani et
al. (2001) concluded that ORP150 is an integral participant in ischemic
cytoprotective pathways.

Ozawa et al. (2001) demonstrated coexpression, colocalization, and
coimmunoprecipitation of ORP150 and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; 192240) in the ER of macrophages within the neovasculature of
human wound granulation tissue. In vitro, inhibition of ORP150 resulted
in retention of VEGF within the ER, whereas overexpression of ORP150
promoted the secretion of VEGF into hypoxic culture supernatants,
indicating that ORP150 may participate in VEGF transport to the
cytoplasm. In wounds of diabetic mice, overexpression of ORP150 resulted
in accelerated repair and closure; suppression of ORP150 delayed repair.
Ozawa et al. (2001) concluded that ORP150 plays a role in the promotion
of angiogenesis, and more generally acts as a molecular chaperone under
hypoxic conditions to facilitate protein transport and processing in the
ER.

Two members of the HSP70 family are required for protein biogenesis in
the yeast endoplasmic reticulum: Lhs1 (homologous to HYOU1) and Kar2
(homologous to HSPA5, or BiP; 138120). Steel et al. (2004) found that
Lhs1 and Kar2 specifically interacted to couple, and coordinately
regulate, their respective activities. Lhs1 stimulated Kar2 by providing
a specific nucleotide exchange activity, whereas Kar2 reciprocally
activated the Lhs1 ATPase. In yeast, the 2 ATPase activities are
coupled, and their coordinated regulation is essential for normal
function in vivo.

Zhao et al. (2010) showed that overexpression of Hyou1 prevented ER
stress and rescued neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells in Sil1 (608005)
-/- mice, whereas decreasing expression of Hyou1 exacerbated these
phenotypes. Purkinje cells from the caudal lobules of the cerebellum
from Sil1 -/- mice typically do not show signs of ER stress; however,
decreased expression of Hyou1 in these cells resulted in signs of ER
stress, ubiquitin-positive inclusions, and death. Zhao et al. (2010)
suggested that HYOU1 and SIL1 have partially redundant functions as BiP
nucleotide exchange factors in Purkinje cells.

614888	TITLE *614888 ALPHA- AND GAMMA-ADAPTIN-BINDING PROTEIN; AAGAB
;;p34
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP1 and AP2 are heterotetrameric complexes involved in clathrin-coated
vesicle trafficking that associate with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
and plasma membrane, respectively. AAGAB, or p34, interacts with the
gamma-adaptin (AP1G1; 603533) subunit of AP1 and with the alpha-adaptin
(AP2A1; 601026) subunit of AP2 (Page et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using mouse gamma-adaptin in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA
library, Page et al. (1999) cloned Aagab, which they called p34. The
deduced protein contains 315 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected variable Aagab expression in all rat tissues examined.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 15 linked to punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma type I (PPKP1A; 148600), followed by PCR of a
human keratinocyte cDNA library, Giehl et al. (2012) cloned full-length
AAGAB. RT-PCR analysis detected AAGAB expression in hair follicle cells,
skin, HaCaT keratinocytes, and lymphocytes, with highest relative
expression in HaCaT cells. Database analysis suggested ubiquitous AAGAB
expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal palmoplantar skin
detected granular cytoplasmic AAGAB staining, particularly in the
stratum basale and the first suprabasal cell layers of the stratum
spinosum. Much weaker staining was detected in upper layers of the
stratum spinosum, where it localized only around nuclei in a few
keratinocytes. Dermal vessels were also AAGAB positive.

Independently, Pohler et al. (2012) cloned AAGAB by RT-PCR of HaCaT cell
total RNA. The deduced 315-amino acid protein contains a RAB (see
179508)-like GTPase domain in its N-terminal half and an adaptin-binding
domain in its C-terminal half. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed
AAGAB expression in all 48 human tissues examined, with highest
expression in rectum and thymus, followed by adrenal gland, spleen,
uterus, and vagina. Lowest expression was detected in mammary gland.
Fluorescence-tagged AAGAB was expressed in cytosol, but not in membrane
or clathrin-coated vesicle fractions, of HaCaT and HeLa cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Independently, Giehl et al. (2012) and Pohler et al. (2012) determined
that the AAGAB gene contains 10 exons. Pohler et al. (2012) reported
that the AAGAB gene spans 53.7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Giehl et al. (2012) mapped the AAGAB gene
to chromosome 15q22.33-q23.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Page et al. (1999) found that rat p34
interacted with mouse gamma-adaptin and alpha-adaptin.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blot analysis, Pohler et
al. (2012) confirmed that p34 interacted with both AP1 and AP2
complexes. Knockdown of p34 did not alter the TNG or plasma membrane
localization of AP1 or AP2, respectively. In HaCaT cells, knockdown of
AAGAB increased EGFR (131550) mRNA levels and EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation, indicative of active EGFR signaling. Pohler et al.
(2012) concluded that AAGAB may have a role in regulating EGFR turnover,
possibly via ATPase activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 families with type I punctate palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1;
148600), Giehl et al. (2012) identified 2 heterozygous nonsense
mutations in the AAGAB gene, R161X (614888.0001) and R124X
(614888.0002), that segregated fully with disease in the respective
families. Immunofluorescence analyses of skin from the palms and soles
of affected individuals revealed that the amount of granular staining in
keratinocytes was lower in the cytoplasm but higher around the nucleus
than in keratinocytes from controls, suggesting clumping of defective
keratin molecules.

In a collection of 18 PPKP1 kindreds from Scotland, Ireland, Japan, and
Tunisia, 11 of which had a family history consistent with autosomal
dominant inheritance, Pohler et al. (2012) identified heterozygous
mutations in the AAGAB gene (see, e.g., 614888.0001 and
614888.0003-614888.0006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, ARG161TER

In affected members of 2 Croatian families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Giehl et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 481C-T transition in exon 5 of the AAGAB
gene, resulting in an arg161-to-ter (R161X) substitution. The mutation
was not found in unaffected family members. Genotyping of 21 individuals
from the 2 families revealed a 1.2-Mb common haplotype between markers
SNP15-67469128 and SNP15-68728632, indicating that the affected
individuals inherited the mutation by descent from a common ancestor.
Immunoblot analysis confirmed the predicted truncated size of
approximately 24 kD for R161X and showed a strong band, suggesting that
the protein is stable and not degraded. Allele-specific PCR
amplification yielded only a very small peak for the 481C-T allele.

In a 4-generation Scottish family with PPKP, Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for the R161X mutation, which segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
databases.

.0002
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, ARG124TER

In affected members of a German family with type I punctate palmoplantar
keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Giehl et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 370C-T transition in exon 4 of the AAGAB gene,
resulting in an arg124-to-ter (R124X) substitution. The mutation was not
found in unaffected family members. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the
predicted truncated size of approximately 18 kD for R124X but showed
only a faint band, suggesting that the corresponding mRNA is prone to
decay. Allele-specific PCR amplification yielded undetectable results
for the 370C-T allele, indicating loss of the protein.

.0003
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, 2-BP DEL, 348AG

In affected members of 3 Tunisian families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), 1 of which was originally
reported by El Amri et al. (2010), Pohler et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (348_349delAG) in the AAGAB gene,
predicted to cause a frameshift within the GTPase domain resulting in a
premature termination codon (R116Sfs*1).

.0004
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, 1-BP DEL, NT473

In affected members of 5 Scottish families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (473del) in the AAGAB
gene, predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in a premature
termination codon (Gly158Glufs*0).

.0005
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, 4-BP DEL, NT200

In affected members of 2 Japanese families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (200_203del) in the AAGAB
gene, predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in a premature
termination codon (Phe67Leufs*41).

AAGAB, IVS, G-A, +1

In affected members of 2 Scottish families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a splice site mutation (870+1G-A) in the
AAGAB gene.

CLONING

Akasaka et al. (1990) isolated a GPX2 cDNA from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase contains
190 amino acids.

Chu et al. (1993) isolated GPX2 from a human HepG2 cDNA library and
identified a UGA codon for selenocysteine at nucleotide positions
152-154. Northern blot analysis detected a 1-kb GPX2 mRNA mainly in
gastrointestinal tissues in human and rodent and in human liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chu et al. (1996) demonstrated that the GPX2 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

Chu (1994) mapped the GPX2 gene to chromosome 14 by Southern analysis of
human/hamster somatic cell hybrids. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Chu et al. (1996) mapped the gene to 14q24.1.

Although GPX2 is a single gene in humans, there are 2 genes in the mouse
genome with homology to GPX2. Using a panel of mouse interspecies
backcross DNA, Chu et al. (1996) mapped one gene to mouse chromosome 12
in a region homologous to human 14q24.1 where human GPX2 maps; they
thought that most likely the chromosome 12 gene represents the
functional mouse Gpx2 gene. The other Gpx2-like gene mapped to mouse
chromosome 7. Its pseudogene nature was revealed by analysis of its
sequence which showed that it is intronless, has deletion of a single
nucleotide in the coding region, and has a poly(A) tail at its 3-prime
untranslated region.

613565	TITLE *613565 UBIQUITINATION FACTOR E4B; UBE4B
;;UFD2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; UFD2A;;
KIAA0684
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned UBE4B, which they designated
KIAA0684. The deduced 903-amino acid protein shares weak similarity with
Dictyostelium NOSA, a developmental regulator involved in proteasomal
degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Koegl et al., 1999). See also
UBE4A, 603753. Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al. (1998) found uniformly high
KIAA0684 expression in all 10 human tissues examined. In vitro
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 92
kD by SDS-PAGE.

Kaneko et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ube4b, which they called Ufd2a, from
testis and T cell cDNA libraries. The deduced 1,174-amino acid protein
has a C-terminal U-box domain including a proline residue perfectly
conserved among U-box proteins. Western blot analysis detected Ufd2a at
an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD in most mouse tissues examined,
with highest abundance in cerebrum, cerebellum, and skeletal muscle.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed localization of Ufd2a in the
cytoplasm of cortical pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By expressing epitope-tagged mouse proteins in human embryonic kidney
cells, Kaneko et al. (2003) showed that Ufd2a interacted with Vcp
(601023), a AAA-family ATPase implicated in protein folding.

Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay with mouse and human UBE4B and
MDM2 (164785), Wu et al. (2011) showed that either UBE4B or MDM2 alone
led to monoubiquitination of the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53; 191170),
while UBE4B in combination with MDM2 promoted p53 polyubiquitination.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays
revealed that UBE4B interacted directly with MDM2. Overexpression and
knockdown studies in mouse and human cell lines revealed that
interaction of UBE4B with MDM2 reduced the half-life of p53 via
proteasome-mediated degradation and caused repression of p53-dependent
transactivation and apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krona et al. (2003) determined that the UBE4B gene contains 28 exons.

Kaneko et al. (2003) found that the mouse Ube4b gene contains 27 coding
exons. The promoter region has a CpG island that contains a functional
cis-acting element, but no TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the UBE4B
gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Krona et al. (2003)
mapped the UBE4B gene to chromosome 1p36.3-p36.2.

600927	TITLE *600927 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 2D; CDKN2D
;;p19(INK4D)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclins are important in regulating the cell cycle through their
formation of enzymatic complexes with various cyclin-dependent kinases.
The D type cyclins complex with CDK4 (123829) and CDK6 (603368) to
govern progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle and later are
involved with inactivating phosphorylation of the RB1 protein (614041),
which results in release of RB1-associated transcription factors that
are needed for entry into S phase (Okuda et al., 1995). The activity of
the cyclin D-dependent kinases is, in part, controlled by inhibitors
such as the INK4 family, which includes INK4a (CDKN2A; 600160), 4b
(CDKN2B; 600431), 4c (CDKN2C; 603369), and 4d (CDKN2D). INK4a has been
shown to act by competing with CDK4 and CDK6 and functions as a tumor
suppressor in a variety of cancers.

CLONING

The INK4d protein was first identified in a yeast 2-hybrid system
screened for CDK4 binding proteins (Hirai et al., 1995).

Okuda et al. (1995) described the cloning of the human INK4d gene
(CDKN2D). The predicted 166-amino acid protein is 86% identical to the
mouse protein and about 45% identical to other human INK4 family
members. Northern blot analysis showed that the 1.4-kb transcript is
ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in tissues with the most
rapidly dividing cells. Lowest expression occurred at mid-G1 phase and
was highest during S phase.

GENE FUNCTION

The mouse INK4d protein interacts with Cdk6. In fibroblasts and
macrophages it is rapidly induced at the G1-to-S transition.
Overexpression of INK4d caused NIH 3T3 cells to arrest in G1 phase and
inhibited cyclin D1-CDK4 kinase activity (Hirai et al., 1995).

GENE STRUCTURE

Matsuzaki et al. (2002) characterized the CDKN2D promoter region using
sequence analysis and truncated 5-prime flanking regions in luciferase
reporter assays. They identified several SP1 (189906) and AP2 (107580)
sites within an active promoter region and found that mutation of the
second SP1 site reduced promoter activity. There was no TATA box.

MAPPING

Okuda et al. (1995) obtained a P1-phage genomic clone including the gene
and mapped it by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 19p13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zindy et al. (1999) generated mice with targeted deletions of both the
Ink4d and Kip1 genes. They found that terminally differentiated,
postmitotic neurons in these mice reentered the cell cycle, divided, and
underwent apoptosis. Zindy et al. (1999) noted that when either Ink4d or
Kip1 alone are deleted, the postmitotic state is maintained, suggesting
a redundant role for these genes in mature neurons.

Zindy et al. (2000) generated Ink4d-null mice by targeted gene
disruption. These animals developed into adulthood and had normal life
spans. Males exhibited marked testicular atrophy associated with
increased apoptosis of germ cells, although they remained fertile.
Ink4d-null mice did not spontaneously develop tumors, and they showed
normal sensitivity to ionizing radiation and carcinogens. Zindy et al.
(2000) concluded that Ink4d is not a tumor suppressor but is involved in
spermatogenesis.

Zindy et al. (2001) determined that both Ink4c and Ink4d were expressed
in the seminiferous tubules of postnatal wildtype mice, being largely
confined to postmitotic spermatocytes undergoing meiosis. Loss of either
Ink4c or Ink4d alone was associated with male fertility, but
double-knockout males were sterile. Spermatogonia did not differentiate
properly and became apoptotic. Residual spermatozoa had reduced motility
and decreased viability. Loss of Ink4c alone or in combination with loss
of Ink4d was associated with impaired differentiation of Leydig cells
and reduced testosterone levels, but there was no effect on the levels
of luteinizing hormone produced by the anterior pituitary. Loss of Ink4d
alone was associated with elevated levels of follicle-stimulating
hormone. Loss of Ink4c or Ink4d, either singly or in combination, had no
effect on female reproductive function.

In the organ of Corti, sensory hair cells and supporting cells become
postmitotic during embryogenesis and remain quiescent for the life of
the animal. When lost as a result of environmental insult or genetic
abnormality, hair cells do not regenerate, and this loss is a common
cause of deafness in humans. Chen et al. (2003) reported that targeted
deletion of Ink4d alone was sufficient to disrupt the maintenance of the
postmitotic state of sensory hair cells in postnatal mice. In Ink4d -/-
animals, hair cells aberrantly reentered the cell cycle and subsequently
underwent apoptosis, resulting in progressive hearing loss.

DESCRIPTION Kuefer et al. (1996) described a cDNA whose predicted 248-amino acid
protein sequence is approximately 40% identical to myeloid leukemia
factor 1 (601402). Expression of MLF2 was ubiquitous. Kuefer et al.
(1996) mapped the gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 12p13, a

600778	TITLE *600778 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 1B; CDKN1B
;;p27(KIP1);;
KIP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDKN1B, or p27(KIP1), is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that blocks
the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase upon differentiation signals or
cellular insult. CDKN1B also regulates cell motility and apoptosis
(summary by Cuesta et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cDNA probe amplified from the MV1Lu mink cell line to screen a
kidney cDNA library, Polyak et al. (1994) cloned human CDKN1B, which
they called KIP1. The deduced 198-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 22.3 kD. It has a 60-amino acid N-terminal domain that
shares 44% identity with the corresponding region of CIP1/WAF1 (CDKN1A;
116899). It also has a C-terminal bipartite nuclear localization signal
and a consensus CDC2 (CDK1; 116940) phosphorylation site. KIP1 shares
about 90% amino acid identity with mink and mouse Kip1, with highest
identity in the N-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

Stegmaier et al. (1995) studied loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the
region 12p13-p12 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia; this chromosomal
region often shows deletion in such patients. In 15% of informative
patients, there was evidence of LOH of the TEL locus (600618) which was
not evident on cytogenetic analysis. Detailed examination of patients
with LOH showed that the critically deleted region included a second
candidate tumor suppressor gene, referred to by them as KIP1, which
encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor previously called p27
(Toyoshima and Hunter, 1994 and Polyak et al., 1994). Based on the STS
content of TEL-positive YACs, Stegmaier et al. (1995) reported that KIP1
and TEL were in close proximity.

GENE FUNCTION

Polyak et al. (1994) showed that recombinant mouse Kip1 inhibited
phosphorylation of histone H1 (see 142709) by human cyclin A (see CCNA1;
604036)-CDK2 (116953), cyclin E (CCNE1; 123837)-CDK2, and cyclin B1
(CCNB1; 123836)-CDK2 complexes. Addition of Kip1 also inhibited
phosphorylation of RB (614041) by cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2, and
cyclin D2 (CCND2; 123833)-CDK4 (123829). The isolated N-terminal domain
of Kip1 had similar inhibitory activity in these assays. Kip1 bound to
preactivated cyclin E-CDK2 complexes and prevented phosphorylation and
activation of CDK2 in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Kip1 activity was
lowest in S phase in MV1Lu cells, and Kip1 overexpression inhibited S
phase entry. Kip1 mRNA content remained unchanged during the cell cycle,
suggesting that Kip1 activity was controlled at a posttranscriptional
level. Polyak et al. (1994) concluded that KIP1 can inhibit both CDK
activation and the kinase activity of assembled and activated
cyclin-CDK.

CDK activation requires association with cyclins and phosphorylation by
CAK (CCNH; 601953) and leads to cell proliferation. Inhibition of
cellular proliferation occurs upon association of CDK inhibitor (e.g.,
CDKN1B) with a cyclin-CDK complex. Sheaff et al. (1997) showed that
expression of CCNE1-CDK2 at physiologic levels of ATP resulted in
phosphorylation of CDKN1B at thr187, leading to elimination of CDKN1B
from the cell and progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. At
low ATP levels, the inhibitory functions of CDKN1B were enhanced,
thereby arresting cell proliferation.

Apoptosis of human endothelial cells after growth factor deprivation is
associated with rapid and dramatic upregulation of cyclin A (see
604036)-associated CDK2 activity. Levkau et al. (1998) showed that in
apoptotic cells the carboxyl-termini of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and
CDKN1B are truncated by specific cleavage. The enzyme involved in this
cleavage is CASP3 (600636) and/or a CASP3-like caspase. After cleavage,
CDKN1A loses its nuclear localization sequence and exits the nucleus.
Cleavage of CDKN1A and CDKN1B resulted in a substantial reduction in
their association with nuclear cyclin-CDK2 complexes, leading to a
dramatic induction of CDK2 activity. Dominant-negative CDK2, as well as
a mutant CDKN1A resistant to caspase cleavage, partially suppressed
apoptosis. These data suggested that CDK2 activation, through
caspase-mediated cleavage of CDK inhibitors, may be instrumental in the
execution of apoptosis following caspase activation.

High levels of p27(KIP1), present in quiescent (G0) cells, have been
shown to decline upon mitogen induction (Sherr and Roberts, 1995).
Braun-Dullaeus et al. (1999) explored the role of p27(KIP1) and other
cell cycle proteins in mediating angiotensin II (see 106150)-induced
vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy or hyperplasia. Angiotensin II
treatment (100 nM) of quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells led to
upregulation of the cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1 (168461),
CDK2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (176740), and CDK1. Levels of
p27(KIP1), however, remained high, and the activation of the G1-phase
CDK2 was inhibited as the cells underwent hypertrophy. Angiotensin II
stimulated an increase in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and the
percentage of S-phase cells in p27(KIP1) antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
(ODN)-transfected cells but not in control ODN transfected cells. The
authors concluded that angiotensin II stimulation of quiescent cells in
which p27(KIP1) levels are high results in hypertrophy but promotes
hyperplasia when levels of p27(KIP1) are low, as in the presence of
other growth factors.

Medema et al. (2000) demonstrated that p27(KIP1) is a major target of
AFX-like forkhead proteins. They demonstrated that AFX integrates
signals from PI3K/PKB (see AKT1; 164730) signaling and RAS (see
190020)/RAL (see 179551) signaling to regulate transcription of
p27(KIP1). They demonstrated that p27 -/- cells are significantly less
inhibited by AFX activity than their p27 +/+ counterparts.

Dijkers et al. (2002) showed that both cytokine withdrawal and Fkhrl1
(FOXO3A; 602681) activation induced apoptosis in mammalian cell lines
through a death receptor-independent pathway. This involved
transcriptional upregulation of p27(KIP1) and proapoptotic Bim (BCL2L11;
603827), loss of mitochondrial integrity, cytochrome c release, and
caspase activation. PKB protected cells from cytokine withdrawal-induced
apoptosis by inhibiting Fkhrl1, resulting in the maintenance of
mitochondrial integrity.

Peters and Ostrander (2001) commented on the work of Di Cristofano et
al. (2001), demonstrating how cooperation between Cdkn1b and Pten
(601728) contribute to suppression of prostate tumors. They gave a
useful tabulation of the cytogenetic location of 16 mapped prostate
cancer susceptibility loci and candidate genes.

Phosphorylation leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of CDKN1B.
Carrano et al. (1999) determined that SKP2 (601436) specifically
recognizes phosphorylated CDKN1B predominantly in S phase rather than in
G1 phase, and is the ubiquitin-protein ligase necessary for CDKN1B
ubiquitination.

Shin et al. (2002) demonstrated a novel mechanism of AKT-mediated
regulation of p27(KIP1). Blockade of HER2/NEU (164870) in tumor cells
inhibited AKT kinase activity and upregulated nuclear levels of
p27(KIP1). Recombinant AKT and AKT precipitated from tumor cells
phosphorylated wildtype p27 in vitro. P27 contains an AKT consensus
RXRXXT(157)D within its nuclear localization motif. Active
(myristoylated) AKT phosphorylated wildtype p27 in vivo but was unable
to phosphorylate a T157A-p27 mutant. Wildtype p27 localized in the
cytosol and nucleus, whereas the mutant p27 localized exclusively in the
nucleus and was resistant to nuclear exclusion by AKT. Expression of
phosphorylated AKT in primary human breast cancers statistically
correlated with the expression of p27 in tumor cytosol. Shin et al.
(2002) concluded that AKT may contribute to tumor cell proliferation by
phosphorylation and cytosolic retention of p27, thus relieving CDK2 from
p27-induced inhibition.

Liang et al. (2002) demonstrated that AKT phosphorylates p27, impairs
the nuclear import of p27, and opposes cytokine-mediated G1 arrest. In
cells transfected with constitutively active AKT, wildtype p27
mislocalized to the cytoplasm, but mutant p27 was nuclear. In cells with
activated AKT, wildtype p27 failed to cause G1 arrest, while the
antiproliferative effect of the mutant p27 was not impaired. Cytoplasm
p27 was seen in 41% (52 of 128) primary human breast cancers in
conjunction with AKT activation and was correlated with a poor patient
prognosis. Liang et al. (2002) concluded that their data showed a novel
mechanism whereby AKT impairs p27 function that is associated with an
aggressive phenotype in human breast cancer.

Viglietto et al. (2002) independently demonstrated that AKT regulates
cell proliferation in breast cancer cells by preventing
p27(KIP1)-mediated growth arrest. They also showed that threonine at
position 157 is an AKT phosphorylation site and causes retention of
p27(KIP1) in the cytoplasm, precluding p27(KIP1)-induced G1 arrest.

Gopfert et al. (2003) analyzed fragments of the p27 transcript for their
contribution to cell cycle-regulated translation. An element in the p27
5-prime UTR rendered reporter translation cell cycle-sensitive with
maximal translation in G1-arrested cells. The 114-bp element contained a
G/C-rich hairpin domain that was predicted to form multiple stable
stemloops and also overlapped with a small upstream open reading frame
(ORF). Both structures contributed to cell cycle-regulated translation.
The upstream ORF could be translated in vitro, and its sequence and
position were evolutionarily conserved in mouse and chicken. The precise
sequence or length of the upstream ORF-encoded peptide were not
important for p27 translation, suggesting that ribosomal recruitment to
its initiation codon, rather than the translation product itself,
contributes to the regulation.

Using NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Kamura
et al. (2004) found that Skp2 was the major ubiquitin ligase involved in
ubiquitination of nuclear p27(KIP1) at the S and G2 phases, and that a
complex made up of Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472) and Kpc2 (UBAC1; 608129)
ubiquitinated cytoplasmic p27(KIP1) at G1 phase. Cytoplasmic degradation
of p27(KIP1) required p27(KIP1) nuclear export by Crm1 (XPO1; 602559).

The inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation in
osteoblasts has been well documented. Thomas et al. (2004) found that
Runx2 (600211), a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation in
mammalian cells, was disrupted in 6 of 7 mammalian osteosarcoma cell
lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of human osteosarcomas indicated
that expression of p27(KIP1) was also lost as tumors lost osteogenic
differentiation. Thomas et al. (2004) found that ectopic expression of
Runx2 induced growth arrest through p27(KIP1)-induced inhibition of
S-phase cyclin complexes, followed by dephosphorylation of RB1 (614041)
and G1 cell cycle arrest. They concluded that RUNX2 establishes a
terminally differentiated state in osteoblasts through RB1- and
p27(KIP1)-dependent mechanisms that are disrupted in osteosarcomas.

White et al. (2006) showed that postmitotic supporting cells purified
from the postnatal mouse cochlea retain the ability to divide and
trans-differentiate into new hair cells in culture. Furthermore, they
demonstrated that age-dependent changes in supporting cell proliferative
capacity are due in part to changes in the ability to downregulate
p27(Kip1). White et al. (2006) concluded that postnatal mammalian
supporting cells are potential targets for therapeutic manipulation.

Grimmler et al. (2007) found that a conserved tyrosine (Y88) in the
CDK-inhibitory domain of human p27 could be phosphorylated by the Src
family kinase LYN (165120) and the oncogene product BCR-ABL (see
189980). Phosphorylation of Y88 did not prevent binding of p27 to cyclin
A/CDK2, but it caused phosphorylated Y88 and the inhibitory domain of
p27 to be ejected from the CDK2 active site, restoring partial CDK
activity. This allowed Y88-phosphorylated p27 to be efficiently
phosphorylated on thr187 by CDK2, which in turn promoted its
SCF-SKP2-dependent degradation.

Chu et al. (2007) showed that the oncogenic kinase SRC (190090)
phosphorylated human p27 at Y74 and Y88. SRC inhibitors increased
cellular p27 stability, whereas SRC overexpression accelerated p27
proteolysis. SRC-phosphorylated p27 inhibited cyclin E/CDK2 poorly in
vitro, and SRC transfection reduced p27/cyclin E/CDK2 complexes.
SRC-activated human breast cancer cell lines exhibited reduced p27, and
there was a correlation between SRC activation and reduced nuclear p27
in 482 primary human breast cancers. In tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancer cell lines, SRC inhibition increased p27 levels and restored
tamoxifen sensitivity. Chu et al. (2007) concluded that SRC-mediated
phosphorylation of p27 reduces its inhibitory action on cyclin E/CDK2,
facilitating subsequent p27 proteolysis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an adult human heart cDNA library, Hauck
et al. (2008) showed that p27 interacted with the C-terminal region of
casein kinase-2 (CK2)-alpha-prime (CSNK2A2; 115442). Immunocytochemical
analysis of primary rat ventricular cardiomyocytes revealed
colocalization of p27 with CK2-alpha-prime. Angiotensin II, a potent
inducer of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, induced proteasomal degradation of
p27 in primary rat cardiomyocytes through CK2-alpha-prime-dependent
phosphorylation of p27 on ser83 and thr187, which are conserved in
humans and rodents. Conversely, unphosphorylated p27 potently inhibited
CK2-alpha-prime. Hauck et al. (2008) concluded that downregulation of
p27 by CK2-alpha-prime is necessary for development of agonist- and
stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that bind to complementary
sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and inhibit their
expression. Kedde et al. (2007) showed that the expression of DND1
(609385), an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein, counteracted
the inhibitory effect of several miRNAs in human cells and in primordial
germ cells of zebrafish by preventing the association of miRNAs with
their target mRNAs. Kedde et al. (2007) detailed the effect of DND1 on
the downregulation of p27 mRNA by miR221 (MIRN221; 300568) in human
cells. Introduction of DND1 abolished the interaction between miR221 and
the 3-prime UTR of p27 mRNA and countered the downregulation of p27
expression by miR221. DND1 bound a uridine-rich region in the 3-prime
UTR of p27 mRNA that is near the miR221-binding site and prevented
miR221 binding. At least 1 of the 2 uridine-rich regions in the p27
3-prime UTR and the RNA-binding domain of DND1 were required to rescue
p27 expression.

Cuesta et al. (2009) found that translation of p27 in HeLa cells and
HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells was cap dependent. Translation
via a proposed internal ribosome entry site appeared to be artifactual,
resulting from the presence of cryptic promoters in the 5-prime UTR.
Cuesta et al. (2009) showed that the dramatic increase in p27 following
phorbol ester treatment was not due to increased mRNA levels, but rather
to downregulation of MIR181A (see 612742) and relief of
MIR181A-dependent translational repression. The 3-prime UTR of p27 mRNA
contains 2 possible MIR181A-binding sites, 1 of which overlaps the
MIR221-binding site. Both MIR181A-binding sites could repress p27
translation either individually or synergistically.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does
not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals as well
as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4 (604064), p27, and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

Baens et al. (1995) characterized 117 cDNAs isolated by direct cDNA
selection using pools of human chromosome 12p cosmids. Among these, 3
matched previously determined cDNA sequences, including the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor referred to as KIP1. STSs were
developed for all cosmids. Regional assignment of the STSs by PCR
analysis with somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) showed that the loci mapped to 12p13. Martin et al.
(1995) mapped this gene, which they referred to as CDKN4, to 12p12.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By PCR-based screening of genomic
YAC clones of the CEPH library, they isolated 7 containing the KIP1
gene. In 4 of these YACs, they found a common STS, D12S358, and 1 of the
4 YACs also contained an additional STS, D12S320, which had been located
4 cM apart from D12S358 on the Genethon genetic map. Most of the YACs
containing the KIP1 gene had been assigned to chromosome 12 from
hybridization data of inter-Alu PCR products from somatic hybrids.

By FISH, Saito et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Kip gene to chromosome
7D3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, Type IV

In a 48-year-old Caucasian female with primary hyperparathyroidism and a
history of pituitary adenoma, consistent with multiple endocrine
neoplasia type IV (MEN4; 610755), Pellegata et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous nonsense mutation in the CDKN1B gene (600778.0001). The
mutation was also identified in her older sister who had renal
angiomyolipoma, her youngest sister, and that sister's teenage daughter,
who reported no symptoms but did not undergo thorough examination. No
mutations in the MEN1 gene (613733) were found in the proband or her
older sister.

- Other Disease Associations

Chang et al. (2004) analyzed the CDKN1B gene in 188 families with
hereditary prostate cancer (see 176807) and found a significant
association between the SNP -79C/T (dbSNP rs34330) and prostate cancer.
The -79C allele was overtransmitted from parents to affected offspring,
an association that was observed primarily in offspring whose age at
diagnosis was less than 65 years. Chang et al. (2004) suggested that
germline variants of this gene play a role in prostate cancer
susceptibility.

Grey et al. (2013) found biallelic loss of CDKN1B gene expression in a
boy with overgrowth and severe neurodevelopmental delay with autism. He
also had left-sided strabismus, maldescended testes, and challenging
behavior. Array CGH identified a heterozygous, approximately 108-kb
deletion on chromosome 12p13 encompassing the 5-prime end of CDKN1B,
APOLD1 (612456), and the 5-prime untranslated region of DDX47 (615428).
The patient's unaffected mother also carried this deletion. Both
individuals had decreased CDKN1B mRNA expression, but only the boy had
decreased protein levels. Sanger sequencing showed that the proband also
had a de novo heterozygous -73G-A transition in the promoter of the
CDKN1B gene that was demonstrated to result in significantly decreased
protein expression. Grey et al. (2013) postulated that the neurologic
phenotype in the proband fit a recessive model of inheritance and was
due to decreased expression of the CDKN1B below a threshold necessary to
ensure normal neurodevelopment. The findings were also consistent with a
mouse knockout model that has gigantism and hyperplasia of multiple
organs (Fero et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fero et al. (1996) found that targeted disruption of the murine
p27(Kip1) gene caused a gene dose-dependent increase in animal size
without other gross morphologic abnormalities. All tissues were enlarged
and contained more cells, although endocrine abnormalities were not
evident. Thymic hyperplasia was associated with increased T-lymphocyte
proliferation, and T cells showed enhanced IL2 (147680) responsiveness
in vitro. Thus, p27 deficiency may cause a cell-autonomous defect
resulting in enhanced proliferation in response to mitogens. In the
spleen, the absence of p27 selectively enhanced proliferation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells. That p27 and Rb function in the same
regulatory pathway was suggested by the finding that p27 deletion, like
deletion of the Rb gene, uniquely caused neoplastic growth of the
pituitary pars intermedia. The absence of p27 also caused an ovulatory
defect and female sterility. Maturation of second ovarian follicles into
corpora lutea, which express high levels of p27, was markedly impaired.

Zindy et al. (1999) generated mice with targeted deletions of both the
Ink4d (600927) and Kip1 genes. They found that terminally
differentiated, postmitotic neurons in these mice reentered the cell
cycle, divided, and underwent apoptosis. Zindy et al. (1999) noted that
when either Ink4d or Kip1 alone are deleted, the postmitotic state is
maintained, suggesting a redundant role for these genes in mature
neurons.

Mitsuhashi et al. (2001) described a mouse model in which p27(Kip1)
transgene expression was spatially restricted to the central nervous
system neuroepithelium and temporally controlled with doxycycline.
Transgene-specific transcripts were detectable within 6 hours of
doxycycline administration, and maximum nonlethal expression was
approached within 12 hours. After 18 to 26 hours of transgene
expression, the G1 phase of the cell cycle was estimated to increase
from 9 to 13 hours in the neocortical neuroepithelium, the maximum G1
phase length attainable in this proliferative population in normal mice.
Thus, the data established a direct link between p27(Kip1) and control
of G1 phase length in the mammalian central nervous system and unveiled
intrinsic mechanisms that constrain the G1 phase length to a putative
physiologic maximum despite ongoing p27(Kip1) transgene expression.

Phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) on threonine-187 by CDK2 is thought to
initiate the major pathway for p27 proteolysis. To test the importance
of this pathway critically in vivo, Malek et al. (2001) replaced the
murine p27 gene with one that encoded alanine instead of threonine at
position 187. Malek et al. (2001) demonstrated that cells expressing p27
with the T187A change were unable to downregulate p27 during the S and
G2 phases of the cell cycle, but that this had a surprisingly modest
effect on cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Malek et al.
(2001) demonstrated a second proteolytic pathway for controlling p27,
one that is activated by mitogens and degrades p27 exclusively during
G1.

Uchida et al. (2005) generated mice expressing human CDKN1B under the
control of the promoter of the rat insulin gene and observed that
increased expression of p27 in pancreatic beta cells induced severe
diabetes as a result of inhibition of beta-cell proliferation. In mice
lacking either insulin receptor substrate-2 (Irs2 -/-; see 600797) or
the long form of the leptin receptor (Lepr -/-; see 601007), they found
progressive accumulation of p27 in the nucleus of beta cells. Deletion
of Cdkn1b ameliorated hyperglycemia in these mouse models of type II
diabetes (125853) by increasing islet mass and maintaining compensatory
hyperinsulinemia, which the authors attributed predominantly to
stimulation of pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. Uchida et al. (2005)
concluded that p27 contributes to beta-cell failure in the development
of type II diabetes in Irs2 -/- and Lepr -/- (db/db) mice.

Wolfraim and Letterio (2005) found increased numbers of both Cd4
(186940)-positive and Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells in
p27(Kip1)-deficient mice. However, there was a greater increase in the
numbers of Cd8-positive T cells, resulting in a lower Cd4:Cd8 ratio, due
in part to enhanced proliferation of naive Cd8-positive T cells, but not
naive Cd4-positive T cells, under conditions of limiting Cd28
(186760)-mediated costimulation.

Nmyc (164840) promotes rapid cell division of granule neuron progenitors
(GNPs) in mice, and its conditional loss during embryonic cerebellar
development results in severe GNP deficiency, perturbs foliation, and
leads to reduced cerebellar mass. Since loss of Nmyc triggers precocious
expression of Kip1 and Ink4c (CDKN2C; 603369) in the cerebellar
primordium, Zindy et al. (2006) disrupted Kip1 and Ink4c in Nmyc-null
cerebella and found that this partially rescued GNP cell proliferation
and cerebellar foliation. They concluded that expression of NMYC and
concomitant downregulation of INK4C and KIP1 contribute to the proper
development of the cerebellum.

Sharov et al. (2006) showed that inhibition of BMP (see BMP1, 112264)
signaling in mouse keratinocytes altered the development of hair
follicles. Microarray and real-time PCR analysis of laser-captured hair
matrix cells showed a strong decrease in the expression of p27(Kip1) and
increased expression of selected cyclins in the transgenic mice.
p27(Kip1) knockout mice showed a similar increase in anagen hair
follicles associated with increased cell proliferation in hair bulbs.
Alternatively, activation of BMP signaling in human keratinocytes
induced growth arrest and stimulated p27(Kip1) expression. Sharov et al.
(2006) concluded that p27(Kip1) mediates the effects of BMP signaling on
hair follicle size.

Fritz et al. (2002) described a multiple endocrine neoplasia-like
autosomal recessive disorder in the rat. Animals exhibiting the mutant
phenotype developed multiple neuroendocrine malignancies within the
first year of life, including bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma,
multiple extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, bilateral medullary thyroid cell
neoplasia, bilateral parathyroid hyperplasia, and pituitary adenoma. The
appearance of neoplastic disease was preceded by the development of
bilateral juvenile cataracts. Although the spectrum of affected tissues
was reminiscent of human forms of MEN, no germline mutations were
detected in the RET (164761) or MEN1 (613733) genes. Segregation studies
in F1 and F2 crosses yielded frequencies of affected animals consistent
with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

In rats with an MEN-like syndrome (Menx), with phenotypic overlap of
MEN1 (131100) and MEN2A (171400), Pellegata et al. (2006) performed
linkage analysis and identified a locus in a 4-Mb segment on rat
chromosome 4, which includes the Cdkn1b gene. Sequencing revealed a
homozygous frameshift mutation in the Cdkn1b gene resulting in a
dramatic reduction of p27(Kip1) protein.

Besson et al. (2007) generated knockin mice expressing a mutant p27
protein, called p27(CK-), that was unable to interact with cyclins and
cyclin-dependent kinases. In contrast to complete deletion of the Cdkn1b
gene, which causes spontaneous tumors only in pituitary, p27(CK-)
dominantly caused hyperplastic lesions and tumors in multiple organs.
The high incidence of spontaneous tumors in lung and retina was
associated with amplification of stem/progenitor cell populations.

Karlas et al. (2010) reported the discovery of 287 human host cell
genes, including CDKN1B, influencing influenza A virus replication in a
genomewide RNA interference screen. Using an independent assay, Karlas
et al. (2010) confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic
HIN1 (119 hits) or the pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A
virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. CDKN1B inhibited both viral
strains. Furthermore, H1N1 virus-infected p27-null mice accumulated
significantly lower viral titers in the lung, providing in vivo evidence
for the importance of this gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV
CDKN1B, TRP76TER

In a 48-year-old Caucasian female with primary hyperparathyroidism and a
history of pituitary adenoma (MEN4; 610755), Pellegata et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 692G-A transition in the CDKN1B gene,
resulting in a trp76-to-ter (W76X) substitution. The mutation was also
identified in her older sister who had renal angiomyolipoma, her
youngest sister, and that sister's teenaged daughter, who reported no
symptoms but did not undergo thorough examination. The mutation was not
found in 380 unrelated healthy controls. Molecular and
immunohistochemical analysis of the renal angiomyolipoma showed that it
retained the CDKN1B wildtype allele and demonstrated RNA expression but
showed no p27 protein staining.

182350	TITLE *182350 ATPase, Na+/K+ TRANSPORTING, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE; ATP1A3
;;SODIUM-POTASSIUM-ATPase, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha subunit of the Na,K-ATPase is the catalytic subunit. Three
isoforms are expressed in the nervous system: ATP1A1 (182310), ATP1A2
(182340), and ATP1A3 (de Carvalho Aguiar et al., 2004).

GENE FUNCTION

Agrin (AGRN; 103320) mediates accumulation of acetylcholine receptors at
the developing neuromuscular junction through its interaction with MUSK
(601296), and it has also been implicated in brain development. Through
biochemical studies, Hilgenberg et al. (2006) found that agrin bound
Atp1a3 in mouse cortical neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that Atp1a3 colocalized with agrin-binding sites at synapses. Agrin
inhibited Atp1a3 activity, resulting in membrane depolarization and
increased action potential frequency in mouse cortical neurons in
culture and acute slice. An agrin fragment that acted as a competitive
antagonist depressed action potential frequency, indicating that
endogenous agrin regulates native Atp1a3 function. Hilgenberg et al.
(2006) concluded that agrin regulates activity-dependent processes in
neurons through its interaction with ATP1A3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ovchinnikov et al. (1988) determined that the ATP1A3 gene has about
25,000 basepairs and that its protein-coding region includes 23 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from panels of rodent/human somatic cell
hybrid lines, Yang-Feng et al. (1988) mapped the ATP1A3 gene to
chromosome 19q12-q13.2. Harley et al. (1988) concluded that the order is
qter--DM--APOC2--ATP1A3--cen.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dystonia 12

In 7 unrelated families with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, or
dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified
6 different heterozygous mutations in the ATP1A3 gene
(182350.0001-182350.0006). Functional expression studies and structural
analysis suggested that the mutations impaired enzyme activity or
stability.

Anselm et al. (2009) and Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) reported de novo
heterozygous ATP1A3 mutations (182350.0007 and 182350.0008,
respectively) in patients with DYT12.

- Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood 2

In 82 of 105 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (AHC2;
615820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified 19 different heterozygous
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene (see, e.g., 182350.0009-182350.0012). The
first mutations were identified through exome sequencing of affected
individuals. Thirteen of the 18 mutations observed in sporadic cases
were confirmed to occur de novo. Since it was possible that some
variants represented polymorphisms, Heinzen et al. (2012) estimated that
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene may be responsible for up to 74% of
patients with sporadic, typical AHC. Several mutations were recurrent,
and some occurred within hypermutable sequences. All patients had
infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks, usually associated with episodes
of quadriparesis, abnormal eye movements, autonomic signs, seizures,
dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and developmental delay. Transfection of
several of the mutations in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to
wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased. In contrast,
transfection of DYT12-associated mutations resulted in decreased protein
levels as well as decreased activity. The report expanded the spectrum
of phenotypes associated with mutations in the ATP1A3 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ashmore et al. (2009) identified 6 different EMS-induced missense
mutations in the Atp1a2 and Atp1a3 genes in Drosophila. All mutations
resulted in reduced respiration activity consistent with a loss of
ATPase function and a hypomorphic effect. Different mutant strains
exhibited some abnormalities, including progressive
temperature-dependent paralysis, progressive stress-sensitive paralysis,
and decreased locomotor activity in response to startle, suggesting a
decrease in maximal locomotion capacity. Neuromuscular studies showed
allele-specific pathology, including brain vacuoles and myopathology,
and biochemical studies showed decreased metabolic rates. An unexpected
finding was the some mutant strains had increased longevity, which was
not related to caloric restriction. Low doses of ouabain showed a
similar effect on longevity in control groups. Ashmore et al. (2009)
suggested that these findings may be relevant for studying the
pathogenesis of FHM2 and DYT12 (128235).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, THR613MET

In a sporadic patient (Linazasoro et al., 2002) and affected members of
a second family (Zaremba et al., 2004) with dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235),
de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 1838C-T
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a thr613-to-met (T613M)
substitution in a highly conserved residue near the phosphorylation
domain on the cytoplasmic face of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes.

Brashear et al. (2007) identified the T613M mutation in a family with
DYT12 reported by Pittock et al. (2000).

.0002
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE274THR

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 821T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in an ile274-to-thr (I274T) substitution in a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes. The patient had
disease onset at age 37 years.

.0003
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, GLU277LYS

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 829G-A transition in exon 8 of the ATP1A3
gene, resulting in a glu277-to-lys (E277K) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The
mutation was not identified in 500 northern European control
chromosomes. The patient had disease onset at age 20 years.

Tarsy et al. (2010) identified the E277K mutation in a 29-year-old woman
of African Caribbean descent with DYT12. She had onset at age 26 years
of weakness and flexion of the left hand and ankle, which progressed
rapidly over the next few years to become frank dystonia of the left arm
and bulbar symptoms, including dysphagia, laryngeal dysfunction with
task-specific dysphonia, and oropharyngeal dysmotility. She also had
mild parkinsonism, with hypomimia and wide-based gait. Treatment with
oral trihexyphenidyl and botulinum injection into selected laryngeal
muscles resulted in clinical improvement.

.0004
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE758SER

In 12 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Dobyns et al. (1993), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2273T-G transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
ile758-to-ser (I758S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0005
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, PHE780LEU

In 2 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho
Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2338T-C transition in the
ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a phe780-to-leu (F780L) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the transmembrane region of the protein
close to the extracellular surface. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0006
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP801TYR

In 4 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Brashear et al. (1997), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2401G-T transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
asp801-to-tyr (D801Y) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane region of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0007
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP923ASN

In a boy with early-onset DYT12 (128235) at age 4 years, Anselm et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous de novo 2767G-A transition in exon 20
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp923-to-asn (D923N) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 338 Caucasian control chromosomes. The
substitution was predicted to occur in a residue buried in the membrane
close to the ion-binding residue gln920, suggesting that it may affect
enzyme activity. He was born of an unaffected Caucasian father and
Chinese mother. The onset of dystonia was abrupt, occurring after mild
trauma to the forehead. He developed mutism, eye convergence, and
inability to walk, which later evolved into severe dystonia, severe
dysarthria, and drooling. The condition stabilized over several months,
and he showed mild improvement over the next 8 years. About a year after
onset, he developed unusual episodes of flaccidity lasting for hours,
later replaced by shorter episodes of stiffness. Treatment with L-dopa
was not effective. At the time of the report, he had bulbar symptoms,
striking oromotor dystonia with inability to speak or swallow well, and
apraxia.

.0008
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, 3-BP DUP, 3191TAC

In a 16-year-old female with DYT12 (128235), Blanco-Arias et al. (2009)
reported a de novo heterozygous 3-bp duplication (3191dupTAC) in exon 23
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in duplication of tyr1013, the C-terminal
amino acid of the protein before the stop codon. The mutation was not
found in either parent, her brother, or in 218 control individuals. HeLa
cells expressing the mutant protein showed decreased survival in
response to ouabain challenge, but no defect was detected in protein
expression or plasma membrane targeting. Functional analysis
demonstrated a drastic 40- to 50-fold reduction in Na(+) affinity in the
mutant. Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) suggested a crucial role for the C
terminus of the alpha-subunit in the function of the Na+/K+-ATPase and
emphasized a key impact of Na(+) affinity in the pathophysiology of
DYT12.

.0009
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, ASP801ASN

In 36 of 95 unrelated patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood
(614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2401G-A
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp801-to-asn (D801N)
substitution in the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was
demonstrated to occur de novo in cases where parental material was
available. All patients had infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks,
usually associated with episodes of quadriparesis, abnormal eye
movements, autonomic signs, seizures, dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and
developmental delay. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased. Evaluation of the crystal structure of the
protein predicted that the D801N substitution would prevent the binding
of potassium ions to the pump.

.0010
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLU815LYS

In 19 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (614820),
Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2443G-A transition in
the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a glu815-to-lys (E815K) substitution in
the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was shown to occur de novo
in all patients whose parents were available for study. Transfection of
the mutation in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to wildtype,
but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased.

.0011
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, SER811PRO

In 4 unrelated patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 2431T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in a ser811-to-pro (S811P) substitution in the sixth
transmembrane domain. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased.

.0012
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLY947ARG

In 5 patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 2839G-A transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a
gly947-to-arg (G947R) substitution in the ninth transmembrane domain.
The mutation was shown to occur de novo in all patients whose parents
were available for study.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LMNA gene encodes lamin A and lamin C. Lamins are structural protein
components of the nuclear lamina, a protein network underlying the inner
nuclear membrane that determines nuclear shape and size. The lamins
constitute a class of intermediate filaments. Three types of lamins, A,
B (see LMNB1; 150340), and C, have been described in mammalian cells
(Fisher et al., 1986).

CLONING

By screening human fibroblast and hepatoma cDNA libraries, Fisher et al.
(1986) isolated cDNAs corresponding to lamin A and lamin C. The lamin A
and C proteins are predicted to have molecular masses of 74 kD and 65
kD, respectively. Fisher et al. (1986) and McKeon et al. (1986) found
that the deduced amino acid sequences from cDNA clones of human lamin A
and C are identical for the first 566 amino acids, but that lamin A
contains an extra 98 amino acids (corresponding to approximately 9 kD)
at the C terminus. Lamin C has 6 unique C-terminal amino acids. Both
lamins A and C contain a 360-residue alpha-helical domain with homology
to a corresponding alpha-helical rod domain that is the structural
hallmark of all intermediate filament proteins. Fisher et al. (1986) and
McKeon et al. (1986) concluded that lamin A and lamin C arise by
alternative splicing from the same gene.

Guilly et al. (1987) detected a 3-kb lamin A mRNA and a 2.1-kb lamin C
mRNA in epithelial HeLa cells, but not in T lymphoblasts. Lamin B was
the only lamin present in T lymphoblasts. Guilly et al. (1987) noted
that the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the cytoplasm into
the nucleus differs from the transport of proteins into other
organelles, such as mitochondria, in that sequences are not cleaved and
remain a permanent feature of the mature polypeptide. Lamin A appears to
be an exception to this rule.

Weber et al. (1989) showed that lamin A is synthesized as a precursor
molecule called prelamin A. Maturation of lamin A involves the removal
of 18 residues from the C terminus, which is accomplished by
isoprenylation and farnesylation involving a C-terminal CAAX
(cysteine-aliphatic-aliphatic-any amino acid) box (Sinensky et al.,
1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin and Worman (1993) demonstrated that the coding region of the lamin
A/C gene spans approximately 24 kb and contains 12 exons. Alternative
splicing within exon 10 gives rise to 2 different mRNAs that code for
prelamin A and lamin C.

MAPPING

Wydner et al. (1996) mapped the LMNA gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Gross (2013) mapped the LMNA gene to chromosome 1q22 based on an
alignment of the LMNA sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY847595) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Lloyd et al. (2002) identified proteins interacting with the C-terminal
domain of lamin A by screening a mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte library in a
yeast 2-hybrid interaction screen. Using this approach, the adipocyte
differentiation factor SREBP1 (184756) was identified as a novel lamin A
interactor. In vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down and in vivo
coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed an interaction between lamin A
and both SREBP1a and 1c. A binding site for lamin A was identified in
the N-terminal transcription factor domain of SREBP1, between residues
227 and 487. The binding of lamin A to SREBP1 was noticeably reduced by
FPLD mutations. The authors speculated that fat loss seen in
laminopathies may be caused in part by reduced binding of the adipocyte
differentiation factor SREBP1 to lamin A.

Favreau et al. (2004) analyzed myoblast-to-myotube differentiation in a
mouse myogenic cell line overexpressing wildtype or mutant human lamin
A. In contrast to clones overexpressing wildtype lamin A, those
expressing lamin A with the R453W mutation (150330.0002) differentiated
poorly or not at all, did not exit the cell cycle properly, and were
extensively committed to apoptosis. Clones expressing the R482W mutation
(150330.0011) differentiated normally. Favreau et al. (2004) concluded
that lamin A mutated at arginine-453 fails to build a functional
scaffold and/or fails to maintain the chromatin compartmentation
required for differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes.

Using a novel technique to measure nuclear deformation in response to
biaxial strain applied to cells, Lammerding et al. (2004) found that
Lmna -/- cells showed increased nuclear deformation, defective
mechanotransduction, and impaired viability under mechanical strain
compared to wildtype cells. In addition, activity of nuclear
factor-kappa-B (NFKB; 164011), a mechanical stress-responsive
transcription factor that can act as an antiapoptotic signal, was
impaired in the Lmna -/- cells. The findings suggested that lamin A/C
deficiency is associated with both defective nuclear mechanics and
impaired transcriptional activation.

Broers et al. (2004) used a cell compression device to compare wildtype
and Lmna-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and found that Lmna-null
cells showed significantly decreased mechanical stiffness and
significantly lower bursting force. Partial rescue of the phenotype by
transfection with either lamin A or lamin C prevented gross nuclear
disruption, but was unable to fully restore mechanical stiffness.
Confocal microscopy revealed that the nuclei of Lmna-null cells
exhibited an isotropic deformation upon indentation, despite an
anisotropic deformation of the cell as a whole. This nuclear behavior
suggested a loss of interaction of the disturbed nucleus with the
surrounding cytoskeleton. Actin-(102610), vimentin-(193060), and
tubulin-(191110) based filaments showed disturbed interaction in
Lmna-null cells. Broers et al. (2004) suggested that in addition to the
loss of nuclear stiffness, the loss of a physical interaction between
nuclear structures (i.e., lamins) and the cytoskeleton may cause more
general cellular weakness; they proposed a potential key function for
lamins in maintaining cellular tensegrity.

Van Berlo et al. (2005) showed that A-type lamins were essential for the
inhibition of fibroblast proliferation by TGF-beta-1 (190180).
TGF-beta-1 dephosphorylated RB1 (614041) through protein phosphatase 2A
(PPP2CA; 176915), both of which were associated with lamin A/C. In
addition, lamin A/C modulated the effect of TGF-beta-1 on collagen
production, a marker of mesenchymal differentiation. Van Berlo et al.
(2005) proposed a role for lamin A/C in control of gene activity
downstream of TGF-beta-1, via nuclear phosphatases such as PPP2CA.

Capanni et al. (2005) showed that the lamin A precursor was specifically
accumulated in lipodystrophy cells. Pre-lamin A was located at the
nuclear envelope and colocalized with SREBP1 Binding of SREBP1 to the
lamin A precursor was detected in patient fibroblasts, as well as in
control fibroblasts, forced to accumulate pre-lamin A by farnesylation
inhibitors. In contrast, SREBP1 did not interact in vivo with mature
lamin A or C in cultured fibroblasts. Inhibition of lamin A precursor
processing in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes resulted in sequestration of SREBP1
at the nuclear rim, thus decreasing the pool of active SREBP1 that
normally activates PPAR-gamma (601487) and causing impairment of
preadipocyte differentiation. This defect could be rescued by treatment
with troglitazone, a known PPAR-gamma ligand activating the adipogenic
program.

Scaffidi and Misteli (2006) showed that the same molecular mechanism
responsible for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670) is
active in healthy cells. Cell nuclei from old individuals acquire
defects similar to those of HGPS patient cells, including changes in
histone modifications and increased DNA damage. Age-related nuclear
defects are caused by sporadic use, in healthy individuals, of the same
cryptic splice site in lamin A whose constitutive activation causes
HGPS. Inhibition of this splice site reverses the nuclear defects
associated with aging. Scaffidi and Misteli (2006) concluded that their
observations implicate lamin A in physiologic aging.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) protease inhibitors
(PIs) targeting the viral aspartyl protease are a cornerstone of
treatment for HIV infection and disease, but they are associated with
lipodystrophy and other side effects. Coffinier et al. (2007) found that
treatment of human and mouse fibroblasts with HIV-PIs caused an
accumulation of prelamin A. The prelamin A in HIV-PI-treated fibroblasts
migrated more rapidly than nonfarnesylated prelamin A, comigrating with
the farnesylated form found in ZMPSTE24 (606480)-deficient fibroblasts.
HIV-PI-treated heterozygous ZMPSTE24 fibroblasts exhibited an
exaggerated accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A. Western blot and
enzymatic analysis showed that HIV-PIs inhibited ZMPSTE24 activity and
endoproteolytic processing of a GFP-prelamin A fusion protein, but they
did not affect farnesylation of HDJ2 (DNAJA1; 602837) or activity of
farnesyltransferase (see 134635), ICMT (605851), and RCE1 (605385) in
vitro. Coffinier et al. (2007) concluded that HIV-PIs inhibit ZMPSTE24,
leading to an accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A, possibly explaining
HIV-PI side effects.

The nuclear envelope LINC (links the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton)
complex, which is formed by SUN (e.g., SUN1, 607723) and nesprin (e.g.,
SYNE1, 608441) proteins, provides a direct connection between the
nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton. Haque et al. (2010) stated that
SUN1 and SUN2 interact with LMNA and that LMNA is required for the
nuclear envelope localization of SUN2, but not SUN1. They found that
LMNA mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD2;
181350) and HGPS disrupted interaction of LMNA with mouse Sun1 and human
SUN2. Nuclear localization of SUN1 and SUN2 was not impaired in EDMD2 or
HGPS cell lines. Expression of SUN1, but not SUN2, at the nuclear
envelope was enhanced in some HGPS cells, likely due to increased
interaction of SUN1 with accumulated prelamin A. Haque et al. (2010)
proposed that different perturbations in LMNA-SUN protein interactions
may underlie the opposing effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear
and cellular mechanics.

Liu et al. (2011) reported the generation of induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS
iPSCs showed absence of progerin, and more importantly, lacked the
nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with
premature aging. Upon differentiation of HGPS iPSCs, progerin and its
aging-associated phenotypic consequences were restored. Specifically,
directed differentiation of HGPS iPSCs to vascular smooth muscle cells
led to the appearance of premature senescence phenotypes associated with
vascular aging. Additionally, their studies identified DNA-dependent
protein kinase catalytic subunit (PRKDC; 600899) as a downstream target
of progerin. The absence of nuclear PRKDC holoenzyme correlated with
premature as well as physiologic aging. Because progerin also
accumulates during physiologic aging, Liu et al. (2011) argued that
their results provided an in vitro iPSC-based model to study the
pathogenesis of human premature and physiologic vascular aging.

Chen et al. (2012) showed that cells from Lmna -/- mice, which represent
EDMD2, cells from Lmna(L530P/L530P) mice, which represent HGPS, and
cells from HGPS patients all had overaccumulation of the inner nuclear
envelope SUN1 protein. In wildtype cells, Lmna and Sun1 colocalized at
the nuclear envelope. In Lmna -/- cells, larger amounts of Sun1 were
found at the nuclear envelope and also in the Golgi. The larger amounts
of Sun1 appeared to result from reduced protein turnover. Transfection
of increasing amounts of mouse Sun1 into Lmna-null/Sun1-null murine
cells resulted in increased prevalence of nuclear herniations and
apoptosis, and the herniations appeared to result from Sun1 accumulation
in the Golgi. Loss of the Sun1 gene in both mouse models extensively
rescued cellular, tissue, organ, and lifespan abnormalities. Similarly,
knockdown of overaccumulated SUN1 protein in primary human HGPS cells
corrected nuclear defects and cellular senescence. The findings
indicated that accumulation of SUN1 is a common pathogenetic event in
these disorders.

In mice, Ho et al. (2013) found that lamin A/C-deficient (Lmna-null) and
Lmna(N195K/N195K) (see 150330.0007) mutant cells have impaired nuclear
translocation and downstream signaling of the mechanosensitive
transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1; 606078), a
myocardin family member that is pivotal in cardiac development and
function. Altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of MKL1 was caused by
altered actin dynamics in Lmna-null and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells.
Ectopic expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384),
which is mislocalized in Lmna mutant cells and also linked to
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300) and dilated cardiomyopathy,
restored MKL1 nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant
cells. Ho et al. (2013) concluded that their findings presented a novel
mechanism that could provide insight into the disease etiology for the
cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin
regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal
actin polymerization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the LMNA gene cause a wide range of human diseases. Since
more than 10 different clinical syndromes have been attributed to LMNA
mutations, many of which show overlapping features, attempts at broad
classification have been proposed. Worman and Bonne (2007) suggested
that the disorders may be classified into 4 major types: diseases of
striated and cardiac muscle; lipodystrophy syndromes; peripheral
neuropathy; and premature aging. Benedetti et al. (2007) suggested 2
main groups: (1) neuromuscular and cardiac disorders, and (2)
lipodystrophy and premature aging disorders. The phenotypic
heterogeneity of diseases resulting from a mutation in a single gene can
be explained by the numerous roles of the nuclear lamina, including
maintenance of nuclear shape and structure, as well as functional roles
in transcriptional regulation and heterochromatin organization (review
by Capell and Collins, 2006).

Genschel and Schmidt (2000) compiled a list of 41 known mutations,
predominantly missense, in the LMNA gene. Twenty-three different
mutations had been shown to cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (EDMD2; 181350). Three mutations had been reported to
cause autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1B;
159001), 8 mutations were known to result in dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD1A; 115200), and 7 mutations were reported to cause familial partial
lipodystrophy (FPLD2; 151660). In addition, 1 mutation in LMNA (H222Y;
150330.0014) appeared to be responsible for an autosomal recessive,
atypical form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD3; see 181350).

- Muscular Dystrophies

In 5 families with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(EDMD2; 181350), Bonne et al. (1999) identified 4 mutations in the LMNA
gene (150330.0001-150330.0004) that cosegregated with the disease
phenotype. These findings represented the first identification of
mutations in a component of the nuclear lamina as a cause of an
inherited muscle disorder. The authors noted that lamins interact with
integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, including emerin
(300384), which is mutated in the X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (EDMD1; 310300).

Raffaele di Barletta et al. (2000) showed that heterozygous mutations in
LMNA may cause diverse phenotypes ranging from typical EDMD to no
phenotypic effect. LMNA mutations in patients with autosomal dominant
EDMD occur in the tail and in the 2A rod domain of the protein,
suggesting that unique interactions between lamin A/C and other nuclear
components have an important role in cardiac and skeletal muscle
function. They identified a homozygous LMNA mutation (H222Y;
150330.0014) in 1 patient born of consanguineous unaffected parents,
consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and a severe atypical
phenotype lacking cardiac features.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B; 159001) is an autosomal
dominant, slowly progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with
age-related atrioventricular cardiac conduction disturbances and the
absence of early contractures. Muchir et al. (2000) found mutations in
the LMNA gene in 3 LGMD1B families: a missense mutation (150330.0017), a
deletion of a codon (150330.0018), and a splice donor site mutation
(150330.0019). The 3 mutations were identified in all affected members
of the corresponding families and were absent in 100 unrelated control
subjects.

Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) described a form of congenital muscular
dystrophy (MDC) with onset in the first year of life in 15 children
resulting from de novo heterozygous mutations in the LMNA gene (see,
e.g., 150330.0047-150330.0049). Three patients had severe early-onset
disease, with decreased fetal movements in utero, no motor development,
severe hypotonia, diffuse limb and axial muscle weakness and atrophy,
and talipes foot deformities. The remaining 12 children initially
acquired head and trunk control and independent ambulation, but most
lost head control due to neck extensor weakness, a phenotype consistent
with 'dropped head syndrome.' Ten children required ventilatory support.
Cardiac arrhythmias were observed in 4 of the oldest patients, but were
symptomatic only in 1. Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) concluded that the
identified LMNA mutations appeared to correlate with a relatively severe
phenotype, broadening the spectrum of laminopathies. The authors
suggested that this group of patients may define a new disease entity,
which they designated LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205).

Benedetti et al. (2007) reported 27 individuals with mutations in the
LMNA gene resulting in a wide range of neuromuscular disorders.
Phenotypic analysis yielded 2 broad groups of patients. One group
included patients with childhood onset who had skeletal muscle
involvement with predominant scapuloperoneal and facial weakness,
consistent with EDMD or congenital muscular dystrophy. The second group
included patients with later or adult onset who had cardiac disorders or
a limb-girdle myopathy, consistent with LGMD1B. Those in the group with
early onset tended to have missense mutations, whereas those in the
group with adult onset tended to have truncating mutations. Analysis of
the variants showed that those associated with early-onset phenotypes
were primarily found in the Ig-like domain and in coil 2A, which may
interfere with binding to specific ligands. Those associated with later
onset were mostly located in the rod domain and in coil 2B, which was
predicted to affect the surface of lamin A/C dimers and lead to impaired
filament assembly. Benedetti et al. (2007) speculated that there may be
2 different pathogenetic mechanisms associated with neuromuscular
LMNA-related disorders: late-onset phenotypes may arise through loss of
LMNA function secondary to haploinsufficiency, whereas dominant-negative
or toxic gain-of-function mechanisms may underlie the more severe early
phenotypes.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Cardiac Conduction Defects

Fatkin et al. (1999) studied the LMNA gene in 11 families with autosomal
dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease (CMD1A;
115200) linked to a region on chromosome 1 overlapping that of the LMNA
gene. They identified 5 novel missense mutations
(150330.0004-150330.0009): 4 in the alpha-helical rod domain of lamin A,
and 1 in the tail domain of lamin C. No family members with mutations
had joint contractures or skeletal myopathy characteristic of autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, serum creatine
kinase levels were normal in family members with mutations of the lamin
A rod domain, but mildly elevated in some family members with a defect
in the lamin C tail domain. The authors noted that mutations in the rod
domain of the protein led to dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas mutations
in the head or tail domain caused Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a sporadic patient and 2 unrelated
families with mutations in the LMNA gene who presented with varying
degrees and combinations of muscular dystrophy, partial lipodystrophy,
and cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, presumably due to single
mutations (see 150330.0003 and 150330.0005).

Sebillon et al. (2003) screened the coding sequence of LMNA in DNA
samples from 66 index cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with or without
associated features. They identified a glu161-to-lys mutation (E161K;
150330.0028) in a family with early-onset atrial fibrillation preceding
or coexisting with dilated cardiomyopathy, the previously described
R377H mutation (150330.0017) in the family with quadriceps myopathy
associated with dilated cardiomyopathy previously reported by Charniot
et al. (2003), and a 28insA mutation (150330.0029) leading to a
premature stop codon in a third family with dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects. No mutation in LMNA was found in cases with isolated
dilated cardiomyopathy.

Meune et al. (2006) investigated the efficacy of implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in the primary prevention of sudden
death in patients with cardiomyopathy due to lamin A/C gene mutations.
Patients referred for permanent cardiac pacing were systematically
offered the implantation of an ICD. The patients were enrolled solely on
the basis of the presence of lamin A/C mutations associated with cardiac
conduction defects. Indications for pacemaker implantation were
progressive conduction block and sinus block. In all, 19 patients were
treated. Meune et al. (2006) concluded that ICD implantation in patients
with lamin A/C mutations who are in need of a pacemaker is effective in
treating possibly lethal tachyarrhythmias, and that implantation of an
ICD, rather than a pacemaker, should be considered for such patients.

Taylor et al. (2003) screened the LMNA gene in 40 families and 9
sporadic patients with CMD with or without muscular dystrophy and
identified mutations in 3 families (see, e.g., 150330.0017) and 1
sporadic patient (S573L; 150330.0041). All mutations involved a
conserved residue, cosegregated with the disease within the families,
and were not found in 300 control chromosomes. LMNA mutation carriers
had a severe and progressive form of CMD with significantly poorer
cumulative survival compared to noncarrier CMD patients.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism

In a 17-year-old Caucasian female with premature ovarian failure and
dilated cardiomyopathy, who had features consistent with atypical Werner
syndrome (see 277700) but who was negative for mutation in the RECQL2
gene (604611), Nguyen et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the LMNA gene (L59R; 150330.0052). The authors
suggested the diagnosis of a laminopathy, most likely an atypical form
of mandibuloacral dysplasia (see 248370).

In a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with premature ovarian failure and
dilated cardiomyopathy, McPherson et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for the L59R mutation in the LMNA gene. McPherson et al.
(2009) noted phenotypic similarities between this patient and the
patient previously reported by Nguyen et al. (2007), who carried the
same mutation, as well as a patient originally described by Chen et al.
(2003) with an adjacent A57P mutation in LMNA (150330.0030). Features
common to these 3 patients included premature ovarian failure, dilated
cardiomyopathy, lipodystrophy, and progressive facial and skeletal
changes involving micrognathia and sloping shoulders, but not
acroosteolysis. Although the appearance of these patients was somewhat
progeroid, none had severe growth failure, alopecia, or rapidly
progressive atherosclerosis, and McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that
the phenotype represents a distinct laminopathy involving dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (212112).

- Lipodystrophy Disorders

Patients with Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, or partial
lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2; 151660), are born with normal fat
distribution, but after puberty experience regional and progressive
adipocyte degeneration, often associated with profound insulin
resistance and diabetes. Cao and Hegele (2000) hypothesized that the
analogy between the regional muscle wasting in autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and the regional adipocyte
degeneration in FPLD, in addition to the chromosomal localization of the
FPLD2 locus on 1q21-q22, made LMNA a good candidate gene for FPLD2.
Studies of 5 Canadian probands with familial partial lipodystrophy of
Dunnigan type indicated that each had a novel missense mutation (R482Q;
150330.0010) that cosegregated with the lipodystrophy phenotype and was
absent from 2,000 normal alleles.

Shackleton et al. (2000) identified 5 different missense mutations in
the LMNA gene (see, e.g., 150330.0010-150330.0012) among 10 kindreds and
3 individuals with partial lipodystrophy. All of the mutations occurred
in exon 8, which the authors noted is within the C-terminal globular
domain of lamin A/C. Flier (2000) commented on the significance of LMNA
mutations in partial lipodystrophy.

Vantyghem et al. (2004) characterized the neuromuscular and cardiac
phenotypes of FPLD patients bearing the heterozygous R482W mutation.
Fourteen patients from 2 unrelated families, including 10 affected
subjects, were studied. Clinical and histologic examination showed an
incapacitating, progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in a
42-year-old woman that had been present since childhood, associated with
a typical postpubertal FPLD phenotype. Six of 8 adults presented the
association of calf hypertrophy, perihumeral muscular atrophy, and a
rolling gait due to proximal lower limb weakness. Muscular histology was
compatible with muscular dystrophy in one of them and/or showed a
nonspecific excess of lipid droplets (in 3 cases). Cardiac septal
hypertrophy and atherosclerosis were frequent in FPLD patients. In
addition, a 24-year-old FPLD patient had a symptomatic second-degree
atrioventricular block. Vantyghem et al. (2004) concluded that most
lipodystrophic patients affected by the FPLD-linked R482W mutation show
muscular and cardiac abnormalities.

Mandibuloacral dysplasia (see 248370) is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, craniofacial
anomalies, skeletal malformations, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation.
Patients with MAD frequently have partial lipodystrophy and insulin
resistance, which are features seen in FPLD. In all affected members of
5 consanguineous Italian families with MAD, Novelli et al. (2002)
identified a homozygous missense mutation (R527H; 150330.0021) in the
LMNA gene. Patient skin fibroblasts showed nuclei that presented
abnormal lamin A/C distribution and a dysmorphic envelope, demonstrating
the pathogenic effect of the mutation.

In affected members of a consanguineous family from north India,
Plasilova et al. (2004) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the
LMNA gene (150330.0033). The extent of skeletal lesions in this family
were consistent with MAD, but affected individuals also had classic
features of progeria. Plasilova et al. (2004) suggested that autosomal
recessive HGPS and mandibuloacral dysplasia may represent a single
disorder with varying degrees of disease severity.

Decaudain et al. (2007) identified changes in codon 482 of the LMNA gene
(see, e.g., R482Q 150330.0010 and R482W; 150330.0011) in 17 of 277
unrelated adults investigated for lipodystrophy and/or insulin
resistance. All 17 had classic features of FPLD2. Ten additional
patients who fulfilled the International Diabetes Federation diagnostic
criteria for metabolic syndrome were found to have heterozygous LMNA
mutations that were not in codon 482, but affected all 3 domains of the
protein, the N terminal, central rod domain, and C terminal globulin
domain (see, e.g., R399C; 150330.0043). Because the phenotype of these
patients was not typical of FPLD2, the diagnosis of laminopathy was
delayed. Although lipodystrophy was less severe than in typical FPLD2,
common features included calf hypertrophy, myalgia, and muscle cramps or
weakness. Two patients had cardiac conduction disturbances. Metabolic
alterations were prominent, especially insulin resistance and
hypertriglyceridemia.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2B1

In affected members of inbred Algerian families with an axonal form of
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease linked to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3 (CMT2B1;
605588), De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2002) found a shared common
homozygous ancestral haplotype that was suggestive of a founder mutation
and identified a unique mutation in the LMNA rod domain (R298C;
150330.0020). Ultrastructural studies of sciatic nerves of Lmna-null
mice showed a strong reduction of axon density, axonal enlargement, and
the presence of nonmyelinated axons, all of which were highly similar to
the phenotypes of human peripheral axonopathies.

- Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Other Premature
Aging Syndromes

Eriksson et al. (2003) identified de novo heterozygous point mutations
in lamin A that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS;
176670). Eighteen of 20 classic cases of HGPS harbored the identical de
novo single-base substitution resulting in a silent gly-to-gly change at
codon 608 within exon 11 (150330.0022). This change creates an exonic
consensus splice site and activates cryptic splicing, leading to
deletion of 50 codons at the end of prelamin A. This prelamin A still
retains the CAAX box but lacks the site for endoproteolytic cleavage.
Eriksson et al. (2003) suggested that there is at least 1 site for
phosphorylation, ser625, that is deleted in the abnormal lamin A
protein. De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2003) independently identified the
heterozygous exon 11 cryptic splice site activation mutation
(1824C-T+1819-1968del; 150330.0022) in 2 HGPS patients. Later cellular
studies (Capell et al., 2005; Glynn and Glover, 2005; Toth et al., 2005)
indicated that Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome results from the
production of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is
farnesylated at its C terminus and accumulates at the nuclear envelope,
causing misshapen nuclei (Yang et al., 2006).

Werner syndrome (277700) is an autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome
caused by mutation in the RECQL2 gene (WRN; 604611). Chen et al. (2003)
reported that of 129 index patients referred to their international
registry for molecular diagnosis of Werner syndrome, 26 (20%) had
wildtype RECQL2 coding regions and were categorized as having 'atypical
Werner syndrome' or 'non-WRN' on the basis of molecular criteria.
Because of some phenotypic similarities between Werner syndrome and
laminopathies including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Chen et al. (2003)
sequenced all exons of the LMNA gene in these 26 individuals and found
heterozygosity for novel missense mutations in LMNA in 4 (15%): A57P
(150330.0030), R133L (150330.0027) in 2 persons, and L140R
(150330.0031). Hegele (2003) stated that the clinical designation of
Werner syndrome for each of the 4 patients of Chen et al. (2003), in
whom mutations in the LMNA gene were found, appeared somewhat insecure.
He noted that the comparatively young ages of onset in the patients with
mutant LMNA would be just as consistent with late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome as with early-onset Werner syndrome.
Patients with so-called atypical Werner syndrome and mutant LMNA also
expressed components of nonprogeroid laminopathies. Hegele (2003)
suggested that genomic DNA analysis can help draw a diagnostic line that
clarifies potential overlap between older patients with
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome and younger patients with Werner syndrome,
and that therapies may depend on precise molecular classification.

McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that the patient in whom Chen et al.
(2003) identified an A57P LMNA mutation had a distinct phenotype
involving dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
(212112).

Csoka et al. (2004) screened 13 cell lines from atypical progeroid
patients for mutation in the LMNA gene. They identified 3 novel
heterozygous missense mutations in the LMNA gene in 3 patients: a
13-year-old female with a progeroid syndrome, a 15-year-old male with a
lipodystrophy, and a 20-year-old male with 'atypical progeria.' The
mutations identified in the last 2 patients were the most 5-prime and
3-prime missense mutations, respectively, in LMNA identified to that
time.

Reddel and Weiss (2004) reported that transcription efficiencies of the
mutant and wildtype LMNA alleles were equivalent in HGPS. The mutant
allele gave 2 types of transcripts that encoded truncated and normal
lamin A. Abnormally spliced progerin transcript constituted the majority
(84.5%) of the total steady-state mRNA derived from the mutant allele.
The abnormally spliced progerin transcript was a minority (40%) of all
lamin A transcripts obtained from both alleles. Reddel and Weiss (2004)
concluded that the mutated progerin functions as a dominant negative by
interfering with the structure of the nuclear lamina, intranuclear
architecture, and macromolecular interactions, which collectively would
have a major impact on nuclear function.

Fibroblasts from individuals with HGPS have severe morphologic
abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure. Scaffidi and Misteli (2005)
showed that the cellular disease phenotype is reversible in cells from
individuals with HGPS. Introduction of wildtype lamin A protein did not
rescue the cellular disease manifestations. The mutant LMNA mRNA and
lamin A protein could be efficiently eliminated by correction of the
aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the
activated cryptic splice site. Upon splicing correction, HGPS
fibroblasts assumed normal nuclear morphology, the aberrant nuclear
distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins were
rescued, defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications were
corrected, and proper expression of several misregulated genes was
reestablished. The results established proof of principle for the
correction of the premature aging phenotype in individuals with HGPS.

Huang et al. (2005) designed short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting
mutated pre-spliced or mature LMNA mRNAs and expressed them in HGPS
fibroblasts carrying the 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022). One of the
shRNAs reduced the expression levels of mutant lamin A (so-called LA
delta-50) to 26% or lower. The reduced expression was associated with
amelioration of abnormal nuclear morphology, improvement of
proliferative potential, and reduction in the numbers of senescent
cells.

Moulson et al. (2007) reported 2 unrelated patients with extremely
severe forms of HGPS associated with unusual mutations in the LMNA gene
(150330.0036 and 150330.0040, respectively). Both mutations resulted in
increased use of the cryptic exon 11 donor splice site that is also
observed with the common 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022). As a
consequence, the ratios of mutant progerin mRNA and protein to wildtype
were higher than in typical HGPS patients. The findings indicated that
the level of progerin expression correlates with severity of disease.

Scaffidi and Misteli (2008) found that progerin (150330.0022) expression
in immortalized human skin fibroblasts produced several defects typical
of HGPS. Progerin also caused the spontaneous differentiation of human
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into endothelial cells, and reduced their
differentiation along the adipogenic lineage. Abnormal differentiation
of MSCs appeared to be due to progerin-induced activation of major
downstream effectors of the Notch signaling pathway, including HES1
(139605), HES5 (607348), and HEY1 (602953). Scaffidi and Misteli (2008)
noted that the progerin splice variant of LMNA is present at low levels
in cells from healthy individuals and has been implicated in the normal
aging process. They suggested that progerin-induced defects in Notch
signaling are involved in normal aging and similarly affect adult MSCs
and their differentiation.

- Restrictive Dermopathy

In 2 of 9 fetuses with restrictive dermopathy (275210), a lethal
genodermatosis in which tautness of the skin causes fetal akinesia or
hypokinesia deformation sequence, Navarro et al. (2004) identified
heterozygous splicing mutations in the LMNA gene, resulting in the
complete or partial loss of exon 11 (150330.0036 and 150330.0022,
respectively). In the other 7 patients, they identified a heterozygous
1-bp insertion resulting in a premature stop codon in the zinc
metalloproteinase STE24 gene (ZMPSTE24; 606480). This gene encodes a
metalloproteinase specifically involved in the posttranslational
processing of lamin A precursor. In all patients carrying a ZMPSTE24
mutation, loss of expression of lamin A as well as abnormal patterns of
nuclear sizes and shapes and mislocalization of lamin-associated
proteins was seen. Navarro et al. (2004) concluded that a common
pathogenetic pathway, involving defects of the nuclear lamina and
matrix, is involved in restrictive dermopathy.

Navarro et al. (2005) described 7 previously reported patients and 3 new
patients with restrictive dermopathy who were homozygous or compound
heterozygous for ZMPSTE24 mutations. In all cases there was complete
absence of both ZMPSTE24 and mature lamin A, associated with prelamin A
accumulation. The authors concluded that restrictive dermopathy is
either a primary or a secondary laminopathy, caused by dominant de novo
LMNA mutations or, more frequently, recessive null ZMPSTE24 mutations.
The accumulation of truncated or normal length prelamin A is, therefore,
a shared pathophysiologic feature in recessive and dominant restrictive
dermopathy.

- Heart-Hand Syndrome, Slovenian Type

In a Slovenian family with heart-hand syndrome (610140), originally
reported by Sinkovec et al. (2005), Renou et al. (2008) identified a
splice site mutation in the LMNA gene (150330.0045) that segregated with
disease and was not found in 100 healthy controls. Analysis of
fibroblasts from 2 affected members of the family revealed truncated
lamin A/C protein and nuclear envelope abnormalities, confirming the
pathogenicity of the mutation.

- Other Associations

Hegele et al. (2000) identified a common single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in LMNA, 1908C/T, which was associated with obesity-related traits
in Canadian Oji-Cree. Hegele et al. (2001) reported association of this
LMNA SNP with anthropometric indices in 186 nondiabetic Canadian Inuit.
They found that physical indices of obesity, such as body mass index,
waist circumference, waist-to-hip circumference ratio, subscapular
skinfold thickness, and subscapular-to-triceps skinfold thickness ratio
were each significantly higher among Inuit subjects with the LMNA 1908T
allele than in subjects with the 1908C/1908C genotype. For each
significantly associated obesity-related trait, the LMNA 1908C/T SNP
genotype accounted for approximately 10 to 100% of the attributable
variation. The results indicated that common genetic variation in LMNA
is an important determinant of obesity-related quantitative traits.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In 14 of 15 families with familial partial lipodystrophy, Speckman et
al. (2000) identified mutations in exon 8 of the LMNA gene: 5 families
had an R482Q mutation (150330.0010); 7 families had an R482W alteration
(150330.0011), and 1 family had a G465D alteration (150330.0015). The
R482Q and R482W mutations occurred on different haplotypes, indicating
that they probably had arisen more than once. One family with an
atypical form of familial partial lipodystrophy had an R582H mutation
(150330.0016) in exon 11 of the LMNA gene, which the authors noted can
affect the lamin A protein only. Speckman et al. (2000) noted that all
mutations in Dunnigan lipodystrophy affect the globular C-terminal
domain of the lamin A/C protein, whereas mutations responsible for
dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction-system disease are usually
clustered in the rod domain of the protein (Fatkin et al., 1999).
Speckman et al. (2000) could not detect mutations in the LMNA gene in 1
FPLD family that showed linkage to 1q21-q23.

Hegele (2005) used hierarchical cluster analysis to assemble 16
laminopathy phenotypes into 2 classes based on organ system involvement,
and then classified 91 reported causative LMNA mutations according to
their position upstream or downstream of the nuclear localization signal
(NLS) sequence. Contingency analysis revealed that laminopathy class and
LMNA mutation position were strongly correlated (p less than 0.0001),
suggesting that laminopathy phenotype and LMNA genotype are nonrandomly
associated.

Lanktree et al. (2007) analyzed the LMNA gene in 3 unrelated patients
with FPLD2 and identified heterozygosity for 3 different missense
mutations, all affecting only the lamin A isoform and each changing a
conserved residue. Two of the mutations, D230N (150330.0042) and R399C
(150330.0043), were 5-prime to the NLS, which is not typical of LMNA
mutations in FPLD2. The third mutation, S573L (150330.0041), had
previously been identified in heterozygosity in a patient with dilated
cardiomyopathy and conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) and in
homozygosity in a patient with arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and
progeroid features (see 248370). None of the mutations were found in 200
controls of multiple ethnicities. Because heterozygosity for an S573L
mutation can cause cardiomyopathy without lipodystrophy or lipodystrophy
without cardiomyopathy, Lanktree et al. (2007) suggested that additional
factors, genetic or environmental, may contribute to the precise tissue
involvement.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mounkes et al. (2003) attempted to create a mouse model for autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350) by introducing a
L530P (150330.0004) mutation in the LMNA gene. Although mice
heterozygous for L530P did not show signs of muscular dystrophy and
remained overtly normal up to 6 months of age, mice homozygous for the
mutation showed phenotypes markedly reminiscent of symptoms observed in
progeria patients. Homozygous Lmna L530P/L530P mice were
indistinguishable from their littermates at birth, but by 4 to 6 days
developed severe growth retardation, dying within 4 to 5 weeks.
Homozygous mutant mice showed a slight waddling gait, suggesting
immobility of joints. Other progeria features of these mutant mice
included micrognathia and abnormal dentition--in approximately half of
the mutants a gap was observed between the lower 2 incisors, which also
appeared yellowed. Mutant mice also had loss of subcutaneous fat,
reduced numbers of eccrine and sebaceous glands, increased collagen
deposition in skin, and decreased hair follicle density. Mounkes et al.
(2003) concluded that Lmna L530P/L530P mice have significant phenotypic
overlap with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, including nuclear
envelope abnormalities and decreased doublet capacity and life span of
fibroblasts.

Mounkes et al. (2005) generated mice expressing the human N195K
(150330.0007) mutation and observed characteristics consistent with
CMD1A. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring of cardiac activity
demonstrated that N195K-homozygous mice died at an early age due to
arrhythmia. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that
Hf1b/Sp4 (600540), connexin-40 (GJA5; 121013), and connexin-43 (GJA1;
121014) were misexpressed and/or mislocalized in N195K-homozygous mouse
hearts. Desmin staining revealed a loss of organization at sarcomeres
and intercalated disks. Mounkes et al. (2005) hypothesized that
mutations within the LMNA gene may cause cardiomyopathy by disrupting
the internal organization of the cardiomyocyte and/or altering the
expression of transcription factors essential to normal cardiac
development, aging, or function.

Arimura et al. (2005) created a mouse model of autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy expressing an H222P mutation in Lmna.
At adulthood, male homozygous mice displayed reduced locomotion activity
with abnormal stiff walking posture, and all died by 9 months of age.
They also developed dilated cardiomyopathy with hypokinesia and
conduction defects. These skeletal and cardiac muscle features were also
observed in the female homozygous mice, but with a later onset than in
males. Histopathologic analysis of the mice revealed muscle degeneration
with fibrosis associated with dislocation of heterochromatin and
activation of Smad signaling in heart and skeletal muscles.

Varga et al. (2006) created transgenic mice carrying the G608G
(150330.0022)-mutated human LMNA gene and observed the development of a
dramatic defect of the large arteries, consisting of progressive medial
vascular smooth muscle cell loss and replacement with proteoglycan and
collagen followed by vascular remodeling with calcification and
adventitial thickening. In vivo, these arterial abnormalities were
reflected by a blunted initial response to the vasodilator sodium
nitroprusside, consistent with impaired vascular relaxation, and
attenuated blood pressure recovery after infusion. Varga et al. (2006)
noted that although G608G transgenic mice lacked the external phenotype
seen in human progeria, they demonstrated a progressive vascular
abnormality that closely resembled the most lethal aspect of the human
phenotype.

Frock et al. (2006) found that most cultured muscle cells from Lmna
knockout mice exhibited impaired differentiation kinetics and reduced
differentiation potential. Similarly, knockdown of Lmna or emerin (EMD;
300384) expression by RNA interference in normal muscle cells impaired
differentiation potential and reduced expression of muscle-specific
genes, Myod (159970) and desmin (125660). To determine whether impaired
myogenesis was linked to reduced Myod or desmin levels, Frock et al.
(2006) individually expressed these proteins in Lmna-null myoblasts and
found that both increased the differentiation potential of mutant
myoblasts. Frock et al. (2006) concluded that LMNA and emerin are
required for myogenic differentiation, at least in part, through an
effect on expression of critical myoblast proteins.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by the production
of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is farnesylated at its
C terminus and accumulates at the nuclear envelope, causing misshapen
nuclei (Yang et al., 2006). Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have
been shown to reverse this cellular abnormality (Yang et al., 2005; Toth
et al., 2005; Capell et al., 2005; Mallampalli et al., 2005). Yang et
al. (2006) generated mice with a targeted HGPS mutation (Lmna HG/+) and
observed phenotypes similar to those in human HGPS patients, including
retarded growth, reduced amounts of adipose tissue, micrognathia,
osteoporosis, and osteolytic lesions in bone, which caused spontaneous
rib fractures in the mutant mice. Treatment with an FTI increased
adipose tissue mass, improved body weight curves, reduced the number of
rib fractures, and improved bone mineralization and bone cortical
thickness.

Yang et al. (2008) created knockin mice expressing a nonfarnesylatable
form of progerin. Knockin mice developed the same disease phenotype as
mice expressing farnesylated progerin, although the phenotype was
milder, and embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice contained
fewer misshapen nuclei. The steady-state level of nonfarnesylated
progerin, but not mRNA, was lower in cultured fibroblasts and whole
tissues, suggesting that the absence of farnesylation may accelerate
progerin turnover.

In a mouse model of EDMD carrying an H222P mutation in the Lmna gene
(Arimura et al., 2005), Muchir et al. (2007) found that activation of
MAPK (see 176948) pathways preceded clinical signs or detectable
molecular markers of cardiomyopathy. Expression of H222P-mutant Lmna in
heart tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in tissue-specific
activation of MAPKs and downstream target genes. The results suggested
that activation of MAPK pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of
cardiac disease in EDMD.

Muchir et al. (2009) demonstrated abnormal activation of the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) branch of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade in hearts of
Lmna H222P knockin mice, a model of autosomal Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy. Systemic treatment of Lmna H222P/H222P mice that developed
cardiomyopathy with PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK activation, inhibited
ERK phosphorylation and blocked the activation of downstream genes in
heart. It also blocked increased expression of RNAs encoding natriuretic
peptide precursors and proteins involved in sarcomere organization that
occurred in placebo-treated mice. Histologic analysis and
echocardiography demonstrated that treatment with PD98059 delayed the
development of left ventricular dilatation. PD98059-treated Lmna
H222P/H222P mice had normal cardiac ejection fractions assessed by
echocardiography, whereas placebo-treated mice had a 30% decrease. The
authors emphasized the role of ERK activation in the development of
cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations, and provided further proof of
principle for ERK inhibition as a therapeutic option to prevent or delay
heart failure in humans with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and
related disorders caused by mutations in LMNA.

Davies et al. (2010) created knockin mice harboring a mutant Lmna allele
that yielded exclusively nonfarnesylated prelamin A. These mice had no
evidence of progeria but succumbed to cardiomyopathy. Most of the
nonfarnesylated prelamin A in the tissues of these mice was localized at
the nuclear rim, indistinguishable from the lamin A in wildtype mice.
The cardiomyopathy could not be ascribed to an absence of lamin C
because mice expressing an otherwise identical knockin allele yielding
only wildtype prelamin A appeared normal. The authors concluded that
lamin C synthesis is dispensable in mice and that failure to convert
prelamin A to mature lamin A causes cardiomyopathy in the absence of
lamin C.

Choi et al. (2012) found that ERK activation in H222P/H222P mice
specifically upregulated expression of dual-specificity phosphatase-4
(DUSP4; 602747) in cardiac muscle, with much lower Dusp4 induction in
quadriceps muscle, and no Dusp4 induction in tongue, kidney, and liver.
Dusp4 overexpression in cultured C2C12 muscle cells or targeted to mouse
heart resulted in activation of the Akt (see AKT1; 164730)-Mtor (FRAP1;
601231) metabolic signaling pathway, leading to impaired autophagy and
abnormal cardiac metabolism, similar to findings in H222P/H222P mice.

In 2 families with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(181350), Bonne et al. (1999) found a G-to-C transversion in the LMNA
gene which, resulting in an arg527-to-pro (R527P) substitution. The
mutation, found in heterozygous state, was demonstrated to be de novo in
both families.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a woman with limb-girdle muscle
weakness, spinal rigidity, contractures, elevated creatine kinase,
cardiac conduction abnormalities (atrial fibrillation), partial
lipodystrophy (151660), and increased serum triglycerides who had the
R527P mutation. Van der Kooi et al. (2002) also reported a family with
the R527P mutation in which the proband, her father, and her son all
presented with varying degrees of EDMD, lipodystrophy, and cardiac
conduction abnormalities.

Makri et al. (2009) reported 2 sisters with early-onset autosomal
dominant muscular dystrophy most consistent with EDMD. Because the girls
were born of consanguineous Algerian parents, they were at first thought
to have an autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy. However,
genetic analysis identified a heterozygous R527P mutation in the LMNA
gene in both patients that was not present in either unaffected parent.
The results were consistent with germline mosaicism or a recurrent de
novo event. The older sib had a difficult birth and showed congenital
hypotonia, diffuse weakness, and mild initial respiratory and feeding
difficulties. She sat unsupported at age 2 years and walked
independently from age 4 years with frequent falls and a waddling gait.
At 13 years she had a high-arched palate, moderate limb hypotonia, and
weakness of the pelvic muscles. There was proximal limb wasting,
moderate cervical, elbow, and ankle contractures, pes cavus, spinal
rigidity, and lordosis/scoliosis. Her sister had mild hypotonia in early
infancy, walked without support at 24 months, and showed proximal muscle
weakness. There were mild contractures of the elbow and ankles. At age 9
years, she showed adiposity of the neck, trunk and abdomen, consistent
with lipodystrophy. Brain MRI and cognition were normal in both sisters,
and neither had cardiac involvement. Muscle biopsies showed a dystrophic
pattern.

conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a
178C-G transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg60-to-gly
(R60G) substitution.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a woman with partial lipodystrophy
(151660), hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiomyopathy with conduction
defects who carried the R60G mutation. The patient's mother reportedly
had similar manifestations. The authors noted that lipodystrophy and
cardiac abnormalities were combined manifestations of the same mutation.

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a
254T-G transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in a leu85-to-arg (L85R)
substitution.

LMNA, ASN195LYS

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a
585C-G transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an asn195-to-lys
(N195K) substitution.

Using cells from the mouse model of Mounkes et al. (2005), Ho et al.
(2013) found that Lmna N195K embryonic fibroblasts and bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells had impaired nuclear localization
of the mechanosensitive transcription factor MKL1 (606078). Cardiac
sections from Lmna(N195K/N195K) mice had significantly reduced fractions
of cardiomyocytes with nuclear Mkl1, implicating altered Mkl1 signaling
in the development of cardiomyopathy in these animals. Nuclear
accumulation of Mkl1 was substantially lower in Lmna N195K cells than in
wildtype cells. Altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mkl1 was caused
by altered actin dynamics in Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic
expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384) restored Mkl1
nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells.

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a

substitution.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, ARG571SER

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a
1711C-A transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg571-to-ser
(R571S) substitution. In this family, the C-terminal of lamin C was
selectively affected by the mutation, and the cardiac phenotype was
relatively milder than that associated with mutations in the rod domain
of the LMNA gene. Furthermore, there was subclinical evidence of
involvement of skeletal muscle. Although affected members of this family
had no skeletal muscle symptoms, some had elevated serum creatine kinase
levels, including 1 asymptomatic family member with the genotype
associated with the disease. The arg571-to-ser mutation affected only
lamin C isoforms, whereas previously described defects causing
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350) perturbed both lamin A and
lamin C isoforms.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG482GLN

In 5 probands from 5 Canadian kindreds with familial partial
lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type (151660), Cao and Hegele (2000)
demonstrated heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in exon 8 of the
LMNA gene, predicted to result in an arg484-to-gln (R482Q) substitution.
There were no differences in age, gender, or body mass index in
Q482/R482 heterozygotes compared with R482/R482 homozygotes (normals)
from these families; however, there were significantly more Q482/R482
heterozygotes who had definite partial lipodystrophy and frank diabetes.
Also compared with the normal homozygotes, heterozygotes had
significantly higher serum insulin and C-peptide (see 176730) levels.
The LMNA heterozygotes with diabetes were significantly older than
heterozygotes without diabetes.

Shackleton et al. (2000) found the R482Q mutation in a family with
familial partial lipodystrophy. Hegele et al. (2000) analyzed the
relationship between plasma leptin (164160) and the rare LMNA R482Q
mutation in 23 adult familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) subjects
compared with 25 adult family controls with normal LMNA in an extended
Canadian FPLD kindred. They found that the LMNA Q482/R482 genotype was a
significant determinant of plasma leptin, the ratio of plasma leptin to
body mass index (BMI), plasma insulin, and plasma C peptide, but not
BMI. Family members who were Q482/R482 heterozygotes had significantly
lower plasma leptin and leptin:BMI ratio than unaffected R482/R482
homozygotes. Fasting plasma concentrations of insulin and C peptide were
both significantly higher in LMNA Q482/R482 heterozygotes than in
R482/R482 homozygotes. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that
the LMNA R482Q genotype accounted for 40.9%, 48.2%, 86.9%, and 81.0%,
respectively, of the attributable variation in log leptin, leptin:BMI
ratio, log insulin, and log C peptide. The authors concluded that a rare
FPLD mutation in LMNA determines the plasma leptin concentration.

Boguslavsky et al. (2006) found that overexpression of wildtype LMNA or
mutant R482Q or R482W (150330.0011) in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes
prevented cellular lipid accumulation, inhibited triglyceride synthesis,
and prevented normal differentiation into adipocytes. In contrast,
embryonic fibroblasts from Lmna-null mice had increased levels of basal
triglyceride synthesis and differentiated into fat-containing cells more
readily that wildtype mouse cells. Mutations at residue 482 are not
predicted to affect the structure of the nuclear lamina, but may change
interactions with other proteins. The findings of this study suggested
that mutations responsible for FPLD are gain-of-function mutations.
Boguslavsky et al. (2006) postulated that mutations that result in gain
of function may cause higher binding affinity to a proadipogenic
transcription factor, thus preventing it from activating target genes;
overexpression of the wildtype protein may result in increased numbers
of molecules with a normal binding affinity. Overexpression of Lmna was
associated with decreased levels of PPARG2 (601487), a nuclear hormone
receptor transcription factor putatively involved in adipogenic
conversion. Lmna-null cells had increased basal phosphorylation of AKT1
(164730), a mediator of insulin signaling.

.0011
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG482TRP

In 6 families and 3 isolated cases of partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Shackleton et al. (2000) found heterozygosity for C-to-T transition in
the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg482-to-trp (R482W) substitution. This
is the same codon as that affected in the R482Q mutation (150330.0010).
R482L (150330.0012) is a third mutation in the same codon causing
partial lipodystrophy.

Schmidt et al. (2001) identified a family with partial lipodystrophy
carrying the R482W mutation in the LMNA gene. Clinically, the loss of
subcutaneous fat and muscular hypertrophy, especially of the lower
extremities, started as early as in childhood. Acanthosis and severe
hypertriglyceridemia developed later in life, followed by diabetes.
Characterization of the lipoprotein subfractions revealed that affected
children present with hyperlipidemia. The presence and severity of
hyperlipidemia seem to be influenced by age, apolipoprotein E genotype,
and the coexistence of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, dyslipidemia is
an early and prominent feature in the presented lipodystrophic family
carrying the R482W mutation.

In a family with partial lipodystrophy (151660), Shackleton et al.
(2000) found that the affected individuals were heterozygous for a

LMNA, 1-BP DEL, 959T

In a large family with a severe autosomal dominant dilated
cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) in which the
majority of affected family members showed signs of mild skeletal muscle
involvement, Brodsky et al. (2000) demonstrated heterozygosity in
affected members for a 1-bp deletion (del959T) deletion in exon 6 of the
LMNA gene. One individual had a pattern of skeletal muscle involvement
that the authors considered consistent with mild Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy (181350).

EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
LMNA, HIS222TYR

In a 40-year-old man with a severe, atypical form of EDMD (see 181350),
Raffaele di Barletta et al. (2000) found a homozygous 664C-T transition
in the LMNA gene, resulting in a his222-to-tyr (H222Y) amino acid
substitution. Both parents, who were first cousins, were heterozygous
for the mutation and were unaffected. The mutation was not found among
200 control chromosomes. The patient was the only one with a homozygous
LMNA mutation among a larger study of individuals with autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

.0015
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, GLY465ASP

Speckman et al. (2000) found that 1 of 15 families with familial partial
lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan variety (151660) harbored a gly465-to-asp
(G465D) mutation in exon 8 of the LMNA gene.

.0016
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG582HIS

In a family with an atypical form of familial partial lipodystrophy
(151660), Speckman et al. (2000) identified an arg582-to-his (R582H)
mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene. In a follow-up of this same
family, Garg et al. (2001) reported that 2 affected sisters showed less
severe loss of subcutaneous fat from the trunk and extremities with some
retention of fat in the gluteal region and medial parts of the proximal
thighs compared to women with typical FPLD2. Noting that the R582H
mutation interrupts only the lamin A protein, Garg et al. (2001)
suggested that in typical FPLD2, interruption of both lamins A and C
causes a more severe phenotype than that seen in atypical FPLD2, in
which only lamin A is altered.

.0017
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A, INCLUDED
LMNA, ARG377HIS

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir
et al. (2000) found a G-to-A transition in exon 6 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a substitution of histidine for arginine-377 (R377H).

Taylor et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for the R377H mutation in
an American family of British descent with autosomal dominant dilated
cardiomyopathy and mild limb-girdle muscular disease.

Charniot et al. (2003) described a French family with autosomal dominant
severe dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects or
atrial/ventricular arrhythmias and a skeletal muscular dystrophy of the
quadriceps muscles. Affected members were found to carry the R377H
mutation, which was shown by transfection experiments in both muscular
and nonmuscular cells to lead to mislocalization of both lamin and
emerin (300384). Unlike previously reported cases of LMNA mutations
causing dilated cardiomyopathy with neuromuscular involvement, cardiac
involvement preceded neuromuscular disease in all affected members.
Charniot et al. (2003) suggested that factors other than the R377H
mutation influenced phenotypic expression in this family. Sebillon et
al. (2003) also reported on this family.

In a German woman with LGMD1B, Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous R377H mutation in the LMNA gene. Family
history revealed that the patient's paternal grandmother had proximal
muscle weakness and died from heart disease at age 52, and a paternal
aunt had 'walking difficulties' since youth. The patient's father and 4
cousins all had cardiac disease without muscle weakness ranging from
nonspecific 'heart attacks' to dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia.
The only living affected cousin also carried the mutation.

.0018
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, 3-BP DEL, EXON 3

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir
et al. (2000) found a 3-bp deletion (AAG) in exon 3 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in loss of the codon for lysine-208 (delK208).

.0019
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, IVS9, G-C, +5

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir
et al. (2000) found a G-to-C transversion in the splice donor site of
intron 9, leading to retention of intron 9 and a frameshift at position
536. This potentially results in a truncated protein lacking half of the
globular tail domain of lamins A/C.

.0020
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2B1

De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2002) found a homozygous arg298-to-cys
(R298C) mutation in the LMNA gene in affected members of Algerian
families with CMT2B1 (605588).

Ben Yaou et al. (2007) identified a homozygous R298C mutation in a
female and 2 male affected members of an Algerian family with CMT2B1.
The 2 males also had X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300)
and a hemizygous mutation in the EMD gene (300384).

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL, INCLUDED
LMNA, ARG527HIS

In 5 consanguineous Italian families, Novelli et al. (2002) demonstrated
that individuals with mandibuloacral dysplasia (248370) were homozygous
for an arg527-to-his (R527H) mutation.

In affected members from 2 pedigrees with MADA, Simha et al. (2003)
identified the homozygous R527H mutation.

In a Mexican American boy with MADA born of related parents, Shen et al.
(2003) identified homozygosity for the R527H mutation. The authors noted
that all the patients reported by Novelli et al. (2002) shared a common
disease haplotype, but that the patients reported by Simha et al. (2003)
and their Mexican American patient had different haplotypes, indicating
independent origins of the mutation. The mutation is located within the
C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain in the center of a beta sheet on
the domain surface of the protein.

Lombardi et al. (2007) identified this mutation in compound
heterozygosity with another missense mutation (150330.0044) in a patient
with an apparent MADA phenotype associated with muscular hyposthenia and
generalized hypotonia.

Garavelli et al. (2009) reported 2 unrelated patients with early
childhood onset of MADA features associated with a homozygous R527H
mutation. One presented at age 5 years, 3 months with bulbous distal
phalanges of fingers and was observed to have dysmorphic craniofacial
features, lipodystrophy type A, and acroosteolysis. The second child,
born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, presented at age 4 years, 2
months with a round face, chubby cheeks, thin nose, lipodystrophy type
A, and short, broad distal phalanges. Garavelli et al. (2009) emphasized
that features of this disorder may become apparent as early as preschool
age and that bulbous fingertips may be a clue to the diagnosis.

HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
RESTRICTIVE DERMOPATHY, LETHAL, INCLUDED
LMNA, GLY608GLY

In 18 of 20 patients with classic Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome
(176670), Eriksson et al. (2003) found an identical de novo 1824C-T
transition, resulting in a silent gly-to-gly mutation at codon 608
(G608G) within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This substitution created an
exonic consensus splice donor sequence and results in activation of a
cryptic splice site and deletion of 50 codons of prelamin A. This
mutation was not identified in any of the 16 parents available for
testing.

De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2003) identified the exon 11 cryptic splice
site activation mutation (1824C-T+1819-1968del) in 2 HGPS patients.
Immunocytochemical analyses of lymphocytes from 1 patient using specific
antibodies directed against lamin A/C, lamin A, and lamin B1 showed that
most cells had strikingly altered nuclear sizes and shapes, with
envelope interruptions accompanied by chromatin extrusion. Lamin A was
detected in 10 to 20% of HGPS lymphocytes. Only lamin C was present in
most cells, and lamin B1 was found in the nucleoplasm, suggesting that
it had dissociated from the nuclear envelope due to the loss of lamin A.
Western blot analysis showed 25% of normal lamin A levels, and no
truncated form was detected.

Cao and Hegele (2003) confirmed the observations of Eriksson et al.
(2003) using the same cell lines. They referred to this mutation as
2036C-T.

D'Apice et al. (2004) confirmed paternal age effect and demonstrated a
paternal origin of the 2036C-T mutation in 3 families with isolated
cases of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria.

By light and electron microscopy of fibroblasts from HGPS patients
carrying the 1824C-T mutation, Goldman et al. (2004) found significant
changes in nuclear shape, including lobulation of the nuclear envelope,
thickening of the nuclear lamina, loss of peripheral heterochromatin,
and clustering of nuclear pores. These structural defects worsened as
the HGPS cells aged in culture, and their severity correlated with an
apparent accumulation of mutant protein, which Goldman et al. (2004)
designated LA delta-50. Introduction of LA delta-50 into normal cells by
transfection or protein injection induced the same changes. Goldman et
al. (2004) hypothesized that the alterations in nuclear structure are
due to a concentration-dependent dominant-negative effect of LA
delta-50, leading to the disruption of lamin-related functions ranging
from the maintenance of nuclear shape to regulation of gene expression
and DNA replication.

In an infant with restrictive dermopathy (275210), Navarro et al. (2004)
identified the 1824C-T transition in heterozygous state.

In a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Wuyts et al. (2005)
identified the G608G mutation. In lymphocyte DNA from the parents,
normal wildtype alleles were observed in the father, but a low signal
corresponding to the mutant allele was detected in the mother's DNA. A
segregation study confirmed that the patient's mutation was transmitted
from the mother, who showed germline and somatic mosaicism without
manifestations of HGPS.

Glynn and Glover (2005) studied the effects of farnesylation inhibition
on nuclear phenotypes in cells expressing normal and G608G-mutant lamin
A. Expression of a GFP-progerin fusion protein in normal fibroblasts
caused a high incidence of nuclear abnormalities (as seen in HGPS
fibroblasts), and resulted in abnormal nuclear localization of
GFP-progerin in comparison with the localization pattern of GFP-lamin A.
Expression of a GFP-lamin A fusion containing a mutation preventing the
final cleavage step, which caused the protein to remain farnesylated,
displayed identical localization patterns and nuclear abnormalities as
in HGPS cells and in cells expressing GFP-progerin. Exposure to a
farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), PD169541, caused a significant
improvement in the nuclear morphology of cells expressing GFP-progerin
and in HGPS cells. Glynn and Glover (2005) proposed that abnormal
farnesylation of progerin may play a role in the cellular phenotype in
HGPS cells, and suggested that FTIs may represent a therapeutic option
for patients with HGPS.

In cells from a female patient with HGPS due to the 1824C-T mutation,
Shumaker et al. (2006) found that the inactive X chromosome showed loss
of histone H3 trimethylation of lys27 (H3K27me3), a marker for
facultative heterochromatin, as well as loss of histone H3
trimethylation of lys9 (H3K9me3), a marker of pericentric constitutive
heterochromatin. Other alterations in epigenetic control included
downregulation of the EZH2 methyltransferase (601573), upregulation of
pericentric satellite III repeat transcripts, and increase in the
trimethylation of H4K20. The epigenetic alterations were observed before
the pathogenic changes in nuclear shape. The findings indicated that the
mutant LMNA protein alters sites of histone methylation known to
regulate heterochromatin and provided evidence that the rapid aging
phenotype of HGPS reflects aspects of normal aging at the molecular
level.

Moulson et al. (2007) demonstrated that HGPS cells with the common
1824C-T LMNA mutation produced about 37.5% of wildtype full-length
transcript, which was higher than previous estimates (Reddel and Weiss,
2004).

Using real-time RT-PCR, Rodriguez et al. (2009) found that progerin
transcripts were expressed in dermal fibroblasts cultured from normal
controls, but at a level more than 160-fold lower than that detected in
dermal fibroblasts cultured from HGPS patients. The level of progerin
transcripts, but not of lamin A or lamin C transcripts, increased in
late-passage cells from both normal controls and HGPS patients.

HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
LMNA, GLY608SER

In a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (176670),
Eriksson et al. (2003) identified a G-to-A transition in the LMNA gene
resulting in a gly-to-ser substitution at codon 608 (G608S). This
mutation was not identified in either parent.

Cao and Hegele (2003) confirmed the observation of Eriksson et al.
(2003) using the same cell line.

HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, ATYPICAL
LMNA, GLU145LYS

In a patient with somewhat atypical features of progeria (176670),
Eriksson et al. (2003) identified a glu-to-lys substitution at codon 145
(E145K) in exon 2 of the LMNA gene. This mutation was not identified in
either parent. Atypical clinical features, including persistence of
coarse hair over the head, ample subcutaneous tissue over the arms and
legs, and severe strokes beginning at age 4, may subtly distinguish this
phenotype from classic HGPS.

.0025
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL
LMNA, ARG471CYS

In a patient with an apparently typical progeria phenotype (176670) who
was 28 years old at the time that DNA was obtained, Cao and Hegele
(2003) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in
the LMNA gene. One mutation, arg471 to cys (R471C), resulted from a
1623C-T transition. An arg527-to-cys (R527C) substitution (150330.0026),
resulting from a 1791C-T transition, was found on the other allele.
These mutations were not identified in any of 100 control chromosomes.
Parental DNA for this patient and a clinical description of the parents
were not available. Brown (2004) reported that both he and the patient's
physician, Francis Collins, concluded that the patient had
mandibuloacral dysplasia (248370).

Zirn et al. (2008) reported a 7-year-old Turkish girl, born of
consanguineous parents, who was homozygous for the R471C mutation. She
had a phenotype most consistent with an atypical form of MADA, including
lipodystrophy, a progeroid appearance, and congenital muscular dystrophy
with rigid spine syndrome. These latter features were reminiscent of
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), although there was no
cardiac involvement. She presented at age 10 months with proximal muscle
weakness, contractures, spinal rigidity, and a dystrophic skeletal
muscle biopsy. Characteristic progeroid features and features of
lipodystrophy and mandibuloacral dysplasia were noted at age 3 years and
became more apparent with age. Zirn et al. (2008) commented on the
severity of the phenotype and emphasized the phenotypic variability in
patients with LMNA mutations.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET, INCLUDED
LMNA, ARG133LEU

In a male patient whose phenotype associated generalized acquired
lipoatrophy with insulin-resistant diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and
hepatic steatosis (151660), Caux et al. (2003) found a heterozygous
398G-T transversion in exon 2 of the LMNA gene that resulted in an
arg-to-leu change at codon 133 (R133L) in the dimerization rod domain of
lamins A and C. The patient also had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with
valvular involvement and disseminated whitish papules.
Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of the patient's cultured skin
fibroblasts revealed nuclear disorganization and abnormal distribution
of A-type lamins, similar to that observed in patients harboring other
LMNA mutations. This observation broadened the clinical spectrum of
laminopathies, pointing out the clinical variability of lipodystrophy
and the possibility of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skin involvement.

In 2 unrelated persons with a progeroid syndrome (see 176670), Chen et
al. (2003) found heterozygosity for the R1333L mutation in the LMNA
gene. One was a white Portuguese female who presented at the age of 9
years with short stature. She showed scleroderma-like skin changes and
graying/thinning of hair. Type 2 diabetes developed at the age of 23
years. Hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and voice changes were also present.
The other patient was an African American female in whom the diagnosis
of a progeroid syndrome was made at the age of 18 years.
Scleroderma-like skin, short stature, graying/thinning of hair, and type
2 diabetes at the age of 18 years were features. The deceased father,
paternal aunt, and paternal grandmother of this patient were also
diagnosed with severe insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, suggesting
that the R133L mutation might have been paternally inherited. It is
noteworthy that a substitution in the same codon, R133P (150330.0032),
was reported in a 40-year-old patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy who had disease onset at age 7 years and atrial fibrillation
at age 32 years (Brown et al., 2001). Although Chen et al. (2003)
designated these patients as having 'atypical Werner syndrome' (277700),
Hegele (2003) suggested that the patients more likely had late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

Vigouroux et al. (2003) emphasized that a striking feature in the
patient reported by Caux et al. (2003) was muscular hypertrophy of the
limbs, which contrasts with the muscular atrophy usually present in
Werner syndrome. Muscular hypertrophy, along with insulin-resistant
diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, is more often associated with
LMNA-linked Dunnigan lipodystrophy. Fibroblasts from their patient
showed nuclear abnormalities identical to those described in Dunnigan
lipodystrophy (Vigouroux et al., 2001).

Jacob et al. (2005) studied the pattern of body fat distribution and
metabolic abnormalities in the 2 patients with atypical Werner syndrome
described by Chen et al. (2003). Patient 1, an African American female,
had normal body fat (27%) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed relative paucity of
subcutaneous fat in the distal extremities, with preservation of
subcutaneous truncal fat. She had impaired glucose tolerance and
elevated postprandial serum insulin levels. In contrast, patient 2, a
Caucasian female, had only 11.6% body fat as determined by DEXA and had
generalized loss of subcutaneous and intraabdominal fat on MRI. She had
hypertriglyceridemia and severe insulin-resistant diabetes requiring
more than 200 U of insulin daily. Skin fibroblasts showed markedly
abnormal nuclear morphology compared with those from patient 1. Despite
the deranged nuclear morphology, the lamin A/C remained localized to the
nuclear envelope, and the nuclear DNA remained within the nucleus. Jacob
et al. (2005) concluded that atypical Werner syndrome associated with an
R133L mutation in the LMNA gene is phenotypically heterogeneous.
Furthermore, the severity of metabolic complications seemed to correlate
with the extent of lipodystrophy.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, GLU161LYS

Sebillon et al. (2003) described a family with a history of sudden
cardiac death, congestive heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD1A; 115200). Five affected members had a heterozygous 481G-A
transition in exon 2 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu161-to-lys
(E161K) mutation. Dilated cardiomyopathy was present in only 2 patients,
in whom onset of the disease was characterized by congestive heart
failure and atrial fibrillation (at 29 and 44 years, respectively);
heart transplantation was performed in both patients (at 34 and 51 years
of age). In the 3 other affected members, the onset of disease was also
characterized by atrial fibrillation at 22, 49, and 63 years, but
without dilated cardiomyopathy. A 16-year-old male and 12-year-old
female were also heterozygous for the mutation, but had no signs or
symptoms of heart disease. The 5 affected members were a mother and 2
daughters in 1 branch of the family and 2 brothers in another branch.
Two cardiac deaths were reported in the family history: sudden death at
38 years and congestive heart failure at 68 years. No significant
atrioventricular block was observed in the family, except in 1 patient
for whom cardiac pacing was necessary at 67 years of age because of
sinoatrial block coexisting with atrial fibrillation. Sebillon et al.
(2003) concluded that the phenotype in this family was characterized by
early atrial fibrillation preceding or coexisting with dilated
cardiomyopathy, without significant atrioventricular block, and without
neuromuscular abnormalities.

.0029
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, 1-BP INS, 28A

Sebillon et al. (2003) described a family in which 5 patients with
dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) were
heterozygous for a 1-bp insertion, 28insA, in exon 1 of the LMNA gene.
Three additional patients were considered as phenotypically affected
with documented dilated cardiomyopathy but were not available for DNA
analysis. In the family history, there were 3 cardiac sudden deaths
before 55 years of age. In the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 3
had associated atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker implantation,
1 had premature ventricular beats leading to a cardioverter
defibrillator implantation, and 1 had a mild form of skeletal muscular
dystrophy (mild weakness and wasting of quadriceps muscles, as well as
myogenic abnormalities on electromyogram).

.0030
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, WITH HYPERGONADOTRIPIC HYPOGONADISM
LMNA, ALA57PRO

In an Iranian female with short stature and a progeroid syndrome (see
176670), Chen et al. (2003) found a heterozygous de novo ala57-to-pro
substitution (A57P) resulting from a 584G-C transversion in the LMNA
gene. Onset occurred in her early teens, and she was 23 years old at
diagnosis. Hypogonadism, osteoporosis, osteosclerosis of digits, and
dilated cardiomyopathy were described. Although Chen et al. (2003)
designated this patient as having 'atypical Werner syndrome' (277700),
Hegele (2003) suggested that the patient more likely had late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that the patient in whom Chen et al.
(2003) identified an A57P LMNA mutation had a distinct phenotype
involving dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
(212112).

.0031
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
LMNA, LEU140ARG

In a white Norwegian male with a progeroid syndrome (see 176670), Chen
et al. (2003) found a leu140-to-arg (L140R) substitution resulting from
an 834T-G transversion in the LMNA gene. The patient had onset at age 14
of cataracts, scleroderma-like skin, and graying/thinning of hair, as
well as hypogonadism, osteoporosis, soft tissue calcification, and
premature atherosclerosis. Aortic stenosis and insufficiency were also
present. The patient died at the age of 36 years. Although Chen et al.
(2003) designated this patient as having 'atypical Werner syndrome'
(277700), Hegele (2003) suggested that the patient more likely had
late-onset Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

.0032
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
LMNA, ARG133PRO

In a 40-year-old patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350)
who had disease onset at age 7 years and atrial fibrillation at age 32
years, Brown et al. (2001) found an arg133-to-pro (R133P) mutation in
the LMNA gene. Chen et al. (2003) noted that the same codon is involved
in the arg133-to-leu (150330.0027) mutation in atypical Werner syndrome.

.0033
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, LYS542ASN

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous family from north India with
features of MADA (248370). Plasilova et al. (2004) identified a
homozygous 1626G-C transversion in exon 10 of the LMNA gene, resulting
in a lys542-to-asn (K542N) substitution. The parents and 1 unaffected
daughter were heterozygous for the mutation. Patients in this family
showed uniform skeletal malformations such as acroosteolysis of the
digits, micrognathia, and clavicular aplasia/hypoplasia, characteristic
of mandibuloacral dysplasia. However, the patients also had classic
features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (176670). Plasilova et
al. (2004) suggested that autosomal recessive HGPS and MADA may
represent a single disorder with varying degrees of severity.

.0034
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED
LMNA, SER143PHE

In a young girl with congenital muscular dystrophy and progeroid
features (see 613205), Kirschner et al. (2005) identified a 1824C-T
transition in the LMNA gene, resulting in a de novo heterozygous
missense mutation, ser143 to phe (S143F). The child presented during the
first year of life with myopathy with marked axial weakness, feeding
difficulties, poor head control and axial weakness. Progeroid features,
including growth failure, sclerodermatous skin changes, and osteolytic
lesions, developed later. At routine examination at age 8 years, she was
found to have a mediolateral myocardial infarction.

In cultured skin fibroblasts derived from the patient reported by
Kirschner et al. (2005), Kandert et al. (2007) found dysmorphic nuclei
with blebs and lobulations that accumulated progressively with cell
passage. Immunofluorescent staining showed altered lamin A/C
organization and aggregate formation. There was aberrant localization of
lamin-associated proteins, particularly emerin (EMD; 300384) and
nesprin-2 (SYNE2; 608442), which was reduced or absent from the nuclear
envelope. However, a subset of mutant cells expressing the giant 800-kD
isoform of SYNE2 showed a milder phenotype, suggesting that this isoform
exerts a protective effect. Proliferating cells were observed to express
the 800-kD SYNE2 isoform, whereas nonproliferating cells did not. In
addition, mutant cells showed defects in the intranuclear organization
of acetylated histones and RNA polymerase II compared to control cells.
The findings indicated that the S143F mutant protein affects nuclear
envelope architecture and composition, chromatin organization, gene
expression, and transcription. The findings also implicated nesprin-2 as
a structural reinforcer at the nuclear envelope.

.0035
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, TYR259TER

In 9 affected members of Dutch family with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy type 1B (159001), van Engelen et al. (2005) identified a
777T-A transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in a tyr259-to-ter
substitution (Y259X). The heterozygous Y259X mutation led to a classic
LGMD1B phenotype. One infant homozygous for the mutation was born of
consanguineous parents who were both affected, and delivered at 30
weeks' gestational age by cesarean section because of decreasing cardiac
rhythm. The infant died at birth from very severe generalized muscular
dystrophy. Cultured skin fibroblasts from the infant showed complete
absence of A-type lamins leading to disorganization of the lamina,
alterations in the protein composition of the inner nuclear membrane,
and decreased life span. Van Engelen et al. (2005) noted that the
fibroblasts from this child showed remarkable similarity, in nuclear
architectural defects and in decreased life span, to the fibroblasts of
homozygous LMNA (L530P/L530P) mice (Mounkes et al., 2003).

.0036
RESTRICTIVE DERMOPATHY, LETHAL
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, INCLUDED
LMNA, IVS11, G-A, +1

In a premature infant who died at 6 months of age due to restrictive
dermopathy (275210), Navarro et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
G-to-A transition at position 1 in the intron 11 donor site of the LMNA
gene (IVS11+1G-A), resulting in loss of exon 11 from the transcript. The
patient expressed lamins A and C and a truncated prelamin A.

In a patient with an extremely severe form of HGPS (176670), Moulson et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at the +1
position of the donor splice site of intron 11 in the LMNA gene
(1968+1G-A). RT-PCR studies showed a truncated protein product identical
to that observed in HGPS cell lines with the common 1824C-T mutation
(150330.0022), indicating that the new mutation resulted in the abnormal
use of the same cryptic exon 11 splice site. The findings were in
contrast to those reported by Navarro et al. (2004), who observed
skipping of exon 11 with 1968+1G-A. Further quantitative studies of the
patient's cells by Moulson et al. (2007) found a 4.5-fold increase in
the relative ratio of mutant mRNA and protein to wildtype prelamin A
compared to typical HGPS cells. The findings were confirmed by Western
blot analysis and provided an explanation for the severe phenotype
observed in this patient. He had had abnormally thick and tight skin
observed at 11 weeks of age, and developed more typical but severe
progeroid features over time. He died of infection at age 3.5 years.

.0037
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, ALA529VAL

In 2 unrelated Turkish patients with mandibuloacral dysplasia with type
A lipodystrophy (248370), a 21-year-old woman previously described by
Cogulu et al. (2003) and an 18-year-old man, Garg et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for a 1586C-T transition in the LMNA gene,
resulting in an ala529-to-val (A529V) substitution. Intragenic SNPs
revealed a common haplotype spanning 2.5 kb around the mutated
nucleotide in the parents of both patients, suggesting ancestral origin
of the mutation. The female patient had no breast development despite
normal menstruation, a phenotype different from that seen in women with
the R527H mutation (150330.0021).

.0038
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, GLN493TER

In a German woman with LGMD1B (159001), Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 1477C-T transition in exon 8 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a gln493-to-ter (Q493X) substitution. She presented with
slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness beginning in the lower
extremities and later involving the upper extremities. EMG showed both
neurogenic and myopathic defects in the quadriceps muscle. At age 53
years, she was diagnosed with atrioventricular conduction block and
arrhythmia requiring pacemaker implantation. Family history showed that
her mother had walking difficulties from age 40 years and died of a
heart attack at age 54. Six other deceased family members had suspected
cardiomyopathy without muscle involvement.

.0039
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, IVS8, G-C, +5

Morel et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, the children of
nonconsanguineous Punjabi parents, with familial partial lipodystrophy
type 2 (FPLD2; 151660). The first presented with acanthosis nigricans at
age 5 years, diabetes with insulin resistance, hypertension, and
hypertriglyceridemia at age 13 years, and partial lipodystrophy starting
at puberty. Her sister and their mother had a similar metabolic profile
and physical features, and their mother died of vascular disease at age
32 years. LMNA sequencing showed that the sisters were each heterozygous
for a novel G-to-C mutation at the intron 8 consensus splice donor site,
which was absent from the genomes of 300 healthy individuals. The
retention of intron 8 in mRNA predicted a prematurely truncated lamin A
isoform (516 instead of 664 amino acids) with 20 nonsense 3-prime
terminal residues. The authors concluded that this was the first LMNA
splicing mutation to be associated with FPLD2, and that it causes a
severe clinical and metabolic phenotype.

.0040
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
LMNA, VAL607VAL

In a patient with a severe form of HGPS (176670), Moulson et al. (2007)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1821G-A transition in exon 11 of the
LMNA gene, resulting in a val607-to-val (V607V) substitution. The
1821G-A mutation favored the use of the same cryptic splice site as the
common 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022) and produced the same resultant
progerin product. However, the ratio of mutant to wildtype mRNA and
protein was increased in the patient compared to typical HGPS cells. The
patient had flexion contractures, thick and tight skin, and other severe
progeroid features. He died of infection at 26 days of age.

LMNA, SER573LEU

In a 50-year-old Italian woman with sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Taylor et al. (2003) identified
heterozygosity for a 1718C-T transition in exon 11 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a ser573-to-leu substitution at a highly conserved residue,
predicted to affect the carboxyl tail of the lamin A isoform. The
mutation was not found in the proband's 2 unaffected offspring or in 300
control chromosomes, but her unaffected 60-year-old sister also carried
the mutation.

Van Esch et al. (2006) analyzed the LMNA gene in a 44-year-old male of
European descent with arthropathy, tendinous calcifications, and a
progeroid appearance (see 248370) and identified homozygosity for the
S573L mutation. Progeroid features included a small pinched nose, small
lips, micrognathia with crowded teeth, cataract, and alopecia. He also
had generalized lipodystrophy, and sclerodermatous skin. The arthropathy
affected predominantly the distal femora and proximal tibia in the knee
with tendinous calcifications. However, he had normal clavicles and no
evidence of acroosteolysis. The authors concluded that he had a novel
phenotype. The patient's unaffected 15-year-old son was heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 450 control chromosomes. The
authors noted that the patient had no evidence of cardiomyopathy and his
70-year-old mother, an obligate heterozygote, had no known cardiac
problems.

In a 75-year-old European male with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for the S573L mutation
in the LMNA gene.

In a 46-year-old South Asian female with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 688G-A transition
in exon 4 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an asp230-to-asn (D230N)
substitution at a conserved residue located 5-prime to the nuclear
localization signal. The mutation, predicted to affect only the lamin A
isoform, was not found in 200 controls of multiple ethnic backgrounds.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG399CYS

In a 50-year-old European female with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1195C-T
transition in exon 7 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg399-to-cys
(R399C) substitution at a conserved residue located 5-prime to the
nuclear localization signal. The mutation, predicted to affect only the
lamin A isoform, was not found in 200 controls of multiple ethnic
backgrounds.

Decaudain et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous R399 mutation in a
woman with severe metabolic syndrome. She was diagnosed with
insulin-resistant diabetes at age 32. Chronic hyperglycemia led to
retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and renal failure. She had severe
hypertriglyceridemia and diffuse atherosclerosis, requiring coronary
artery bypass at age 49. Physical examination revealed android fat
distribution with lipoatrophy of lower limbs and calves hypertrophy
without any muscle weakness. Her mother and a brother had diabetes and
died several years earlier.

.0044
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL
LMNA, VAL440MET

In a 27-year-old Italian woman with a mandibuloacral dysplasia type A
(MADA; 248370)-like phenotype, Lombardi et al. (2007) found compound
heterozygosity for missense mutations in the LMNA cDNA: a G-to-A
transition at position 1318 in exon 7 that gave rise to a val-to-met
substitution at codon 440 (V440M), and an R527H substitution
(150330.0021). Each healthy parent was a simple heterozygote for one or
the other mutation. The apparent MADA phenotype was associated with
muscular hyposthenia and generalized hypotonia. Clavicular hypoplasia
and metabolic imbalances were absent. Lombardi et al. (2007)
hypothesized that lack of homozygosity for the R527H mutation attenuated
the MADA phenotype, while the V440M mutation may have contributed to
both the muscle phenotype and the pathogenic effect of the single R527H
mutation.

In affected members of a Slovenian family with heart-hand syndrome
(610140), originally reported by Sinkovec et al. (2005), Renou et al.
(2008) identified heterozygosity for a T-G transversion in intron 9 of
the LMNA gene (IVS9-12T-G), predicted to cause a frameshift and
premature termination in exon 10, with the addition of 14 new amino
acids at the C terminus. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 100 healthy controls. Analysis of fibroblasts from 2
affected individuals confirmed the presence of truncated protein and
revealed aberrant localization of lamin A/C accumulated in intranuclear
foci as well as dysmorphic nuclei with nuclear envelope herniations.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, ALA529THR

In a 56-year-old Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with
mandibuloacral dysplasia and type A lipodystrophy (248370), Kosho et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 1585G-A transition in exon 9 of the LMNA
gene, resulting in an ala529-to-thr (A529T) substitution. The authors
stated that she was the oldest reported patient with the disorder. In
addition to classic MAD with lipodystrophy type A phenotype, including
progeroid appearance, acroosteolysis of the distal phalanges, and loss
of subcutaneous fat in the limbs, she had severe progressive destructive
skeletal and osteoporotic changes. Vertebral collapse led to paralysis.
However, Kosho et al. (2007) also noted that other factors may have
contributed to the severe osteoporosis observed in this patient. Another
mutation in this codon, A529V (150330.0037), results in a similar
phenotype.

mutation in exon 6 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a leu380-to-ser
(L380S) substitution. He showed decreased movements in utero, hypotonia,
talipes foot deformities, no head or trunk control, distal joint

In a 9-year-old girl with congenital muscular dystrophy (613205),
Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in
exon 4 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg249-to-trp (R249W)
substitution. She presented at age 3 to 6 months with axial weakness and
talipes foot deformities. She lost head support at 9 months, had
respiratory insufficiency, joint contractures, and axial and limb muscle
weakness. A de novo heterozygous R249W mutation was also identified in
an unrelated 3-year-old boy with congenital LGMD1B who showed decreased
movements in utero, hypotonia, distal contractures, no head or trunk
control, and respiratory insufficiency. Both patients had increased
serum creatine kinase and showed myopathic changes on EMG studies.

Mercuri et al. (2004) identified a de novo heterozygous 1072G-A
transition in exon 5 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu358-to-lys
(E358K) substitution in 5 unrelated patients with muscular dystrophy.
Three patients had the common phenotype of autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), 1 had early-onset LGMD1B
(159001), and the last had had a more severe disorder consistent with
congenital muscular dystrophy (613205). The mutation was not identified
in 150 controls. The patient with LGMD1B also had cardiac conduction
abnormalities, respiratory failure, and features of lipodystrophy
(151660). Mercuri et al. (2004) commented on the extreme phenotypic
variability associated with this mutation.

In 4 unrelated patients with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy,
Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in
exon 6 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu358-to-lys (E358K)
substitution. Three patients presented before 1 year of age with
hypotonia and later developed head drop with neck muscle weakness. There
was delayed motor development with early loss of ambulation, distal limb
contractures, axial and limb muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency
requiring mechanical ventilation, increased serum creatine kinase, and
dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy. One patient developed ventricular
tachycardia at age 20 years. The fourth patient with congenital LGMD1B
had decreased fetal movements and presented at age 3 to 6 months with
hypotonia, loss of head control, and delayed motor development.

LMNA, 3-BP DEL, 94AAG

In an 18-month-old boy with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205), D'Amico et al. (2005) identified a de novo heterozygous 3-bp
deletion (94delAAG) in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, resulting in the
deletion of lys32. Although he had normal early motor development, he
showed prominent neck extensor weakness resulting in a 'dropped head'
phenotype at age 1 year. He was able to stand independently but had some
difficulty walking.

.0051
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
LMNA, ARG644CYS

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to various phenotypes has not been confirmed.

An arg644-to-cys (R644C) mutation in the LMNA gene has been found in
several different phenotypic presentations (Genschel et al., 2001;
Mercuri et al., 2005; Rankin et al., 2008); however, the pathogenicity
of the mutation has not been confirmed (Moller et al., 2009).

In a German patient with dilated cardiomyopathy with no history history
of conduction system disease (see 152000), Genschel et al. (2001)
identified heterozygosity for a 1930C-T transition in exon 11 of the
LMNA gene resulting in an R644C substitution in the C-terminal domain of
lamin A. The authors noted that the mutation is solely within lamin A,
but not lamin C, whereas previously reported mutations causing dilated
cardiomyopathy are located more in the rod domain of the protein.

Mercuri et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for the R644C mutation
in 4 patients with skeletal and cardiac muscle involvement of varying
severity. In 1 patient, the mutation was found in the affected brother
and the unaffected father, and was not found in the affected mother. The
mutation was not found in 100 unrelated control subjects.

Rankin et al. (2008) described 9 patients in 8 families with the same
mutation. Patients 1 and 2 presented with lipodystrophy and insulin
resistance; patient 1 also had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
Patient 3 presented with motor neuropathy, patient 4 with arthrogryposis
and dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular noncompaction, patient
5 with severe scoliosis and contractures, patient 6 with limb-girdle
weakness, and patient 7 with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.
Patients 8 and 9 were brothers who had proximal weakness and
contractures. The same LMNA was identified in 9 unaffected individuals
in these 9 families, but was not detected in 200 German and 300 British
controls. Rankin et al. (2008) suggested that extreme phenotypic
diversity and low penetrance are associated with the R644C mutation.

.0052
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, WITH HYPERGONADOTRIPIC HYPOGONADISM
LMNA, LEU59ARG

In a 17-year-old Caucasian female with dilated cardiomyopathy and
ovarian failure (212112), Nguyen et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity
for a de novo 176T-C transition in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, predicted to
result in a leu59-to-arg (L59R) substitution. Analysis of nuclear
morphology in patient fibroblasts showed more irregularity and variation
than that of control fibroblasts, with denting, blebbing, and irregular
margins. The mutation was not found in the unaffected parents or in 116
population-based controls.

In a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with dilated cardiomyopathy and ovarian
failure who died from an arrhythmia while awaiting cardiac
transplantation, McPherson et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for
the L59R mutation in the LMNA gene. The mutation was presumed to be de
novo, although the unaffected parents declined DNA testing. The patient
also had a healthy older sister, and there was no family history of
cardiomyopathy or hypogonadism.

.0053
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, ARG541GLY

In 2 sibs with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1A; 115200), Malek et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous 1621C-G transversion in exon 10 of the
LMNA gene, resulting in an arg541-to-gly (R541G) substitution in the
C-terminal tail region. The 23-year-old male proband had a history of
paroxysmal atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and was found by
echocardiogram to have dilation of the left ventricle and global
hypokinesis. Cardiac MRI showed discrete regional areas of akinesis with
muscle thinning in the left ventricle and marked hypertrabeculation in
dysfunctional regions, as well as evidence of fibrosis. The proband's
sister had sinus bradycardia and supraventricular and ventricular
arrhythmias, but normal echocardiogram and cardiac MRI. The sibs' father
and paternal aunt had both died of dilated cardiomyopathy. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the R541G mutant resulted in
the formation of abnormal lamin aggregates, most of which were

604515	TITLE *604515 B-CELL LINKER PROTEIN; BLNK
;;SH2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING LEUKOCYTE PROTEIN, 65-KD; SLP65;;
B CELL-SPECIFIC ADAPTOR PROTEIN; BASH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BLNK gene encodes a B-cell linker protein. Linker or adaptor
proteins provide mechanisms by which receptors can amplify and regulate
downstream effector proteins. BLNK is essential for normal B-cell
development (Fu et al., 1998).

CLONING

Fu et al. (1998) identified a novel B-cell linker protein, which they
called BLNK. BLNK encodes a 456-amino acid polypeptide with basic,
acidic, proline-rich, and SH2 domains. An alternatively spliced product
called BLNK-S lacks basepairs 760 to 828 within the proline-rich domain.
The murine Blnk protein shares 82% identity with human BLNK. There
appeared to be no alternatively spliced form of mouse BLNK. BLNK shows
greatest homology to the SLP76 (601603) linker protein. BLNK mRNA is
predominantly expressed in the spleen, although some level of expression
can be seen in liver, kidney, and pancreas. Expression of BLNK proteins
was detected only in B-cell lines.

Wienands et al. (1998) independently cloned BLNK, which they called
SLP65.

GENE FUNCTION

Fu et al. (1998) showed that BLNK interfaces the B-cell receptor
(BCR)-associated SYK tyrosine kinase (600085) with PLC-gamma (172420),
the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor (164875), and the GRB2
(108355) and NCK (600508) adaptor proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of
BLNK by SYK provides docking sites for these SH2-containing effector
molecules that, in turn, permits the phosphorylation and/or activation
of their respective signaling pathways. Thus, BLNK represents a central
linker protein that bridges the B-cell receptor-associated kinases with
a multitude of signaling pathways and may regulate biologic outcomes of
B-cell function and development.

Ishiai et al. (1999) demonstrated that BLNK is essential in activating
phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma-2 (PLCG2; 600220) and JNK (601158). The
BCR-induced PLC-gamma-2 activation, but not the JNK activation, was
restored by introduction of a membrane-associated form of PLC-gamma-2
into BLNK-deficient B cells. As JNK activation requires both Rac1
(602048) and PLC-gamma-2, Ishiai et al. (1999) concluded that BLNK
regulates the Rac1-JNK pathway, in addition to modulating PLC-gamma-2
localization.

Jumaa et al. (2003) showed that the differentiation regulator SLP65
inhibits pre-B-cell leukemia in mice. Reconstitution of SLP65 expression
in an SLP65 -/- pre-B-cell line led to enhanced differentiation in vitro
and prevented the development of pre-B-cell leukemia in immune-deficient
mice. Tyrosine-96 of SLP65 was required for this activity. The murine
knockout SLP65 pre-B-cell leukemia resembles human childhood pre-B ALL.
Indeed, 16 of the 34 childhood pre-B ALL samples that were tested showed
a complete loss or drastic reduction of SLP65 expression. Jumaa et al.
(2003) suggested that this loss is probably due to the incorporation of
alternative exons into SLP65 transcripts, leading to premature stop
codons. Thus, Jumaa et al. (2003) concluded that the somatic loss of
SLP65 and the accompanying block in pre-B-cell differentiation might be
one of the primary causes of childhood pre-B ALL.

Taguchi et al. (2004) identified a pre-B ALL cell line lacking BLNK
expression in which stimulation of pre-BCR resulted in an absence of
phosphorylation of PLCG2 and an increase in intracellular calcium. In
contrast, activation of MAP kinase (see 602425) and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (see 601232) signaling was not affected. Taguchi et al. (2004)
concluded that BLNK is essential for PLCG2-induced calcium influx and
that BLNK-deficient cell lines may provide an in vitro model for
investigation of the role of BLNK in the pre-B-cell receptor-mediated
signaling mechanism.

Kohler et al. (2005) found that the leucine zipper in the highly
conserved N terminus of mouse Slp65 was essential for its association
with the plasma membrane. Mutation of critical leucines in the zipper
region abolished membrane association, as demonstrated by flow cytometry
and immunofluorescence microscopy.

Sprangers et al. (2006) identified defective SLP65 expression in 7 of 28
cases of pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia and 5 of 27 cases of B-cell
lymphoma. SLP65 deficiency correlated with RAG1 (179615)/RAG2 (179616)
expression and unremitting VH gene rearrangement activity.
Reconstitution of SLP65 expression in SLP65-deficient leukemia and
lymphoma cell lines resulted in RAG1/RAG2 downregulation and prevented
de novo VH-DJH rearrangements and secondary VH replacement. Sprangers et
al. (2006) concluded that iterative VH gene rearrangement represents a
frequent feature in B-lymphoid malignancy and can be attributed to SLP65
deficiency in many cases.

GENE STRUCTURE

The BLNK gene comprises 17 exons spread over about 65 kb of DNA
(Minegishi et al., 1999).

MAPPING

Minegishi et al. (1999) mapped the BLNK gene to chromosome 10q23.2 using
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with agammaglobulinemia and absent B cells (AGM4; 613502),
Minegishi et al. (1999) identified a homozygous splice defect in the
BLNK gene (604515.0001). Although this patient had normal numbers of
pro-B cells, he had no pre-B cells or mature B cells, indicating that
BLNK plays a critical role in orchestrating the pro-B cell to pre-B cell
transition. The patient had developed recurrent otitis at 8 months of
age; after 2 episodes of pneumonia, he was evaluated for
immunodeficiency at 16 months of age. At that time, he had no detectable
serum IgG, IgM, or IgA, and he had less than 1% B cells in the
peripheral circulation. He was started on gammaglobulin replacement, and
between 2 and 20 years of age he did well except for chronic otitis and
sinusitis, hepatitis C acquired from intravenous gammaglobulin, and an
episode of protein-losing enteropathy in adolescence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pappu et al. (1999) generated mice deficient in Blnk by targeted
disruption. B-cell development in Blnk -/- mice was blocked at the
transition from B220+CD43+ progenitor B to B220+CD43- precursor B cells.
Only a small percentage of IgM M++, but not mature IgM(lo)IgD(hi), B
cells were detected in the periphery. Pappu et al. (1999) concluded that
BLNK is an essential component of the BCR signaling pathways and is
required to promote B-cell development.

Flemming et al. (2003) showed that both wildtype and Slp65 -/- bone
marrow-derived B cells required IL7 (146660) for proliferation. In the
absence of IL7, or by the reintroduction of Slp65, many mutant cells
expressed surface IgM and downregulated the pre-BCR. Cells lacking both
the pre-BCR and Slp65 had severely reduced proliferative capacity due to
a requirement for pre-B-cell receptor signaling leading to Erk (see
MAPK1; 176948) activation and Slp65 -/- cell survival. Flemming et al.
(2003) also found that Slp65-deficient mice were significantly more
likely to develop pre-B-cell lymphoma and solid tumors than were
wildtype mice. The authors concluded that SLP65 acts as an efficient
tumor suppressor by accelerating the progression of cells through a
mutation-prone developmental stage.

Hayashi et al. (2004) showed that anti-DNA Ig knockin mice had impaired
BCR editing at multiple levels in the absence of Bash. Mice lacking Bash
also had excessive antibody responses to DNA carrier immunization.
Hayashi et al. (2004) concluded that BCR-signaled receptor editing
contributes to establishing B-cell tolerance.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA 4, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE (1 family)
BLNK, IVS1DS, A-T, +3

In a 20-year-old male with early-onset hypoglobulinemia and absent B
cells (613502), Minegishi et al. (1999) identified a homozygous
alteration of the first exon of the BLNK gene and its flanking intronic
sequence. Two noncontiguous basepair substitutions were identified. The
first was a C-to-A substitution of the third basepair position in codon
10, which encoded a silent proline substitution. The second alteration
was an A-to-T transversion at the +3 position of the splice donor site
for intron 1, 20 basepairs downstream from the alteration in codon 10.
SSCP analysis of DNA from 100 unrelated individuals did not reveal the
same pattern as that of the patient. Minegishi et al. (1999) derived
cDNA directly from this patient's bone marrow and used RT-PCR analysis
to examine the abundance of BLNK transcripts. No BLNK transcripts could
be amplified from the patient's bone marrow. The patient's mother and
father, who were heterozygous for both basepair substitutions in BLNK,
were healthy and had normal concentrations of serum immunoglobulins and
normal numbers of B cells. An older brother developed recurrent otitis
at 6 months of age and died at 16 months of age of pseudomonas sepsis
and neutropenia.

609137	TITLE *609137 RECEPTOR-TRANSPORTING PROTEIN 1; RTP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human RTP1. The
deduced mouse Rtp1 protein contains 263 amino acids and shares 73%
identity with mouse Rtp2 (609138). Rtp1 lacks a signal peptide, but it
has a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected prominent expression of Rtp1 in olfactory and
vomeronasal organs. Long exposure revealed faint expression in brain. In
situ hybridization of mouse olfactory epithelium revealed specific
expression of Rtp1 in olfactory neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

Saito et al. (2004) showed that mouse Rtp1 and Rtp2 promoted functional
cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic kidney
cells. Rtp1 and Rtp2 were associated with OR proteins and enhanced the
OR responses to odorants. Similar but weaker effects were seen with a
third protein, Reep1 (609139). These findings suggested that RTP1 and
RTP2 play significant roles in the translocation of ORs to the plasma
membrane, as well as in the functioning of ORs.
