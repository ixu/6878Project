;;CL6, RAT, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By subtractive hybridization and differential screening following
induction by insulin, Diamond et al. (1993) identified a 'delayed-early
gene,' designated CL-6, from the rat H35 cell line. The deduced
256-amino acid rat protein is highly hydrophobic. CL-6 is the most
highly insulin-induced gene in H35 cells. Northern blot analysis showed
that CL-6 is expressed in normal liver and kidney as well as in
regenerating liver. Peng et al. (1997) isolated a human gene that they
designated insulin-induced gene-1 (INSIG1). They found it to share 80%
identity with the rat CL-6 gene within the translated region.

By PCR of a HepG2 cell cDNA library, Yang et al. (2002) obtained a cDNA
encoding INSIG1. The deduced 277-amino acid protein has at least 6
membrane spanning regions and differs from the sequence reported by Peng
et al. (1997) at residues 27 (ala vs thr), 31 (ala vs pro), 32 (ala vs
pro), 99 (ala vs thr), 170 (val vs gly), and 172 (val vs gly). The human
INSIG1 protein is 84.6% and 84.2% identical to rat and mouse Insig1,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected expression of INSIG1 in
all tissues tested, with high expression in liver. Immunofluorescence of
epitope-tagged INSIG1 in stably transfected CHO cells showed an
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization when the cells were cultured in
either the absence or presence of sterols.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometry, Yang et al.
(2002) identified INSIG1 as an ER protein that binds the sterol-sensing
domain of SREBP (see 184756) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP; 601510)
and facilitates retention of the SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER. In
sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs from ER to Golgi for
proteolytic processing, thereby allowing SREBPs to stimulate cholesterol
synthesis. Using blue native-PAGE, Yang et al. (2002) showed that
sterols induce binding of SCAP to INSIG1, and this binding was
correlated with the inhibition of SCAP exit from the ER. Overexpression
of INSIG1 increased the sensitivity of cells to sterol-mediated
inhibition of SREBP processing. Mutant SCAP (tyr298 to cys) failed to
bind INSIG1 and was resistant to sterol-mediated inhibition of ER exit.
The authors concluded that by facilitating sterol-dependent ER retention
of SCAP, INSIG1 plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis.

Sever et al. (2003) showed that degradation of HMG-CoA reductase
(142910) is accelerated by the sterol-induced binding of its
sterol-sensing domain to the ER protein INSIG1. Accelerated degradation
was inhibited by overexpression of the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP,
suggesting that both proteins bind to the same site on INSIG1. Whereas
INSIG1 binding to SCAP led to ER retention, INSIG1 binding to HMG-CoA
reductase led to accelerated degradation that could be blocked by
proteasome inhibitors. The authors concluded that INSIG1 plays an
essential role in the sterol-mediated trafficking of HMG-CoA reductase
and SCAP.

Song et al. (2005) found that rodent Gp78 (AMFR; 603243), a
membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase, associated with Insig1. Insig1 bound
the membrane domain of Gp78 in the absence or presence of sterols, and
upon addition of sterols, HMG-CoA reductase was recruited to the
complex. Knockdown of Gp78 by RNA interference prevented
sterol-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of endogenous reductase.
Vcp (601023), an ATPase that participates in postubiquitination steps of
ER-associated degradation and is required for reductase degradation,
indirectly associated with Insig1 by binding Gp78. The results
identified GP78 as a ubiquitin ligase that initiates sterol-dependent
degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, and INSIG1 as the bridge between
GP78/VCP and the reductase substrate.

Li et al. (2003) presented experimental results suggesting that INSIG1
expression restricts lipogenesis in mature adipocytes and blocks
differentiation in preadipocytes. They examined gene expression in the
fat tissue of normal mice at the onset of diet-induced obesity. INSIG1
mRNA rose progressively with a high-fat diet and declined on a
restricted diet. Transfection of mouse or human INSIG1 into 3T3-L1
preadipocytes completely prevented oil red O staining and blocked
upregulation of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein-2 (FABP2; 134640),
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPARG2; see 601487),
and carbohydrate response element-binding protein, while reducing
downregulation of preadipocyte factor-1 (PREF1; 176290).

Asp205 in INSIG1 and asp149 in INSIG2 are conserved residues that abut
the fourth transmembrane helix at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane.
Gong et al. (2006) found that mutation of these residues to alanine
resulted in INSIG proteins that were unable to bind SCAP and suppress
cleavage of SREBPs. The mutant INSIGs were also ineffective in
accelerating sterol-stimulated degradation of HMG CoA reductase.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Peng et al. (1997) mapped the
INSIG1 gene to chromosome 7q36.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takaishi et al. (2004) infected Zucker diabetic fatty rats (see 601007)
with recombinant adenovirus containing Insig1 or Insig2 (608660) cDNA.
Triacylglycerols in the liver and plasma of control diabetic rats rose
steeply, whereas the Insig-infected rats exhibited substantial
attenuation of hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia. Insig
overexpression was also associated with a reduction in the elevated
level of nuclear Srebp1c and reduced expression of Srebp1c lipogenic
target enzymes. In normal animals, overexpression of the Insigs reduced
the increase in Srebp1c mRNA and its target enzymes caused by refeeding.
Takaishi et al. (2004) concluded that both Insigs have antilipogenic
action.

Engelking et al. (2005) found that, whereas cholesterol feeding reduced
nuclear Srebps and lipogenic mRNAs in wildtype mice, this feedback
response was severely blunted in Insig1/Insig2 double-knockout mice, and
synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids was not repressed.

In cortical neuron culture, Taghibiglou et al. (2009) found that
activation of NMDA receptors resulted in increased activation and
nuclear accumulation of SREBP1. The activation was primarily mediated by
the NR2B (138252) subunit-containing receptor. Inhibition of
NMDAR-dependent SREBP1 activation by cholesterol decreased NMDA-induced
excitotoxic cell death. Similarly, shRNA against SREBP1 also resulted in
decreased cell death in culture. These findings implicated SREBP1 as a
mediator of NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. NMDAR-mediated activation of
SREBP1 was shown to result from increased Insig1 degradation, which
could be inhibited with an interference peptide. In a rat model of focal
ischemic stroke, systemic administration of the INSIG1 interference
peptide prevented SREBP1 activation, substantially reduced neuronal
damage, and improved behavioral outcome.

610781	TITLE *610781 GUANOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE 2; GMPR2
;;GMP REDUCTASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of GMPR1 (GMPR; 139265) as
query, Deng et al. (2002) identified and subsequently cloned GMPR2 from
a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 348-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 37.9 kD and shares 90% sequence identity
with GMPR1 and 69% identity with E. coli GMPR. Northern blot analysis
detected relatively high levels of both GMPR1 and GMPR2 in heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney, and relatively low levels of both in colon,
thymus, and peripheral blood leukocyte. Strong signals of GMPR2 were
detected in brain, liver, and placenta, whereas weak signals of GMPR1
were observed in these tissues. The apparent Km of GMPR2 for NADPH and
GMP are 26.6 and 17.4 microM, respectively.

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned GMPR2 from a human dendritic cell cDNA
library. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of an
approximately 2.2-kb transcript, with high expression in testis, ovary,
prostate, heart, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, and kidney. An
additional transcript of about 1.3 kb was detected in placenta.
Expression was also detected in most cancer cell lines studied.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) showed that recombinant GMPR2 protein was able to
reduce GMP. Transfection experiments demonstrated that overexpression of
GMPR2 promoted the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells.

EVOLUTION

Deng et al. (2002) presented evidence that the 2 types of GMP reductase
are derived from duplication of an ancient gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deng et al. (2002) determined that the GMPR2 gene contains 10 exons and
spans more than 6.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deng et al. (2002) mapped the GMPR2 gene
to chromosome 14p11.2-p11.1. By the same method, Zhang et al. (2003)
mapped the gene to chromosome 14q11-q21.

612174	TITLE *612174 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN 39; CAB39
;;MO25-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using peptide fragments of proteins that
interacted with the serine/threonine protein kinase LKB1 (STK11; 602216)
in HeLa cells, Boudeau et al. (2003) identified CAB39, which they
designated MO25-alpha. The deduced 341-amino acid protein shares a high
degree of conservation with its C. elegans and Drosophila orthologs.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb MO25-alpha transcript in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle. Western
blot analysis detected MO25-alpha in most tissues and cell lines
examined. Endogenous MO25-alpha in HeLa cells had an apparent molecular
mass of 40 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of human and rat cells, Boudeau et al.
(2003) showed that MO25-alpha associated with STRAD-alpha (608626) and
LKB1. Cotransfection and mutation analysis revealed that MO25-alpha
interacted directly with STRAD-alpha rather than with LKB1, and the
interaction required the last 3 residues of STRAD-alpha. MO25-alpha also
interacted with STRAD-beta (ALS2CR2; 607333) in a complex with LKB1.
MO25-alpha and STRAD-alpha anchored LKB1 in the cytoplasm, excluding it
from the nucleus. Moreover, MO25-alpha enhanced formation of
LKB1-STRAD-alpha complexes in vivo and stimulated LKB1 catalytic
activity about 10-fold. Boudeau et al. (2003) concluded that MO25-alpha
may function as a scaffolding component of the LKB1-STRAD complex and
regulate LKB1 activity and cellular localization.

Using mutagenesis, Boudeau et al. (2004) identified 2 binding sites on
opposite surfaces of MO25-alpha that were required for assembly of the
MO25-alpha-STRAD-alpha-LKB1 complex.

Denning et al. (2012) identified a mechanism of cell extrusion that is
caspase-independent and that can eliminate a subset of the C. elegans
cells programmed to die during embryonic development. In wildtype
animals, these cells die soon after their generation through
caspase-mediated apoptosis. However, in mutants lacking all 4 C. elegans
caspase genes, these cells were eliminated by being extruded from the
developing embryo into the extraembryonic space of the egg. The shed
cells showed apoptosis-like cytologic and morphologic characteristics,
indicating that apoptosis can occur in the absence of caspases in C.
elegans. Denning et al. (2012) described a kinase pathway required for
cell extrusion involving Par4, Strd1, and Mop25.1/25.2, the C. elegans
homologs of the mammalian tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 (602216) and its
binding partners STRAD-alpha (608626) and MO25-alpha. The AMPK-related
kinase Pig1, a possible target of the Par4-Strd1-Mop25 kinase complex,
is also required for cell shedding. Pig1 promotes shed cell detachment
by preventing the cell surface expression of cell adhesion molecules.
Denning et al. (2012) concluded that their findings revealed a mechanism
for apoptotic cell elimination that is fundamentally distinct from that
of canonical programmed cell death.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Zeqiraj et al. (2009) described the structure of the core heterotrimeric
LKB1-STRAD-alpha-MO25-alpha complex, revealing an unusual allosteric
mechanism of LKB1 activation. STRAD-alpha adopts a closed conformation
typical of active protein kinases and binds LKB1 as a pseudosubstrate.
STRAD-alpha and MO25-alpha promote the active conformation of LKB1,
which is stabilized by MO25-alpha interacting with the LKB1 activation
loop. Zeqiraj et al. (2009) suggested that this previously undescribed
mechanism of kinase activation may be relevant to understanding the
evolution of other pseudokinases, and also commented that the structure
reveals how mutations found in Peutz-Jeghers (175200) syndrome and in
various sporadic cancers impair LKB1 function.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CAB39
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH94102).

606112	TITLE *606112 RIBONUCLEASE P, 14-KD SUBUNIT; RPP14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14), 20 kD (RPP20; 606113),
25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP14. The deduced basic protein has 124 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 14 kD. Immunoblot analysis showed
that antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP14 gene to chromosome 3p14.3 based on an
alignment of the RPP14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612779	TITLE *612779 DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE DEHYDROGENASE; DPYD
;;DPD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DPYD gene encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.2), the
initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of the pyrimidine
bases uracil and thymine (Van Kuilenburg et al., 1999).

CLONING

Yokota et al. (1994) cloned and sequenced pig and human DPD cDNAs. The
pig and human enzymes contain 1,025 amino acids and have a calculated
molecular mass of 111 kD. The sequence of the gene suggested that DPD
has at least 3 distinct domains: a possible NADPH binding site and
FAD-binding site in the N terminus, 2 motifs of putative
iron/sulfur-binding sites near the C terminus, and a central peptide
domain corresponding to the uracil-binding site. Expression of the pig
enzyme in E. coli catalyzed the reduction of uracil, thymine, and
5-fluorouracil (5FU) with kinetics approximating those published for the
enzyme purified from mammalian liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wei et al. (1998) characterized the structure of the DPYD gene and
determined that it contains 23 exons spanning about 950 kb.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid strategies, Yokota et al. (1994) mapped the
DPYD gene to the centromeric region of chromosome 1 between 1p22 and
1q21.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Takai et al. (1994) assigned the
DPYD gene to 1p22.

GENE FUNCTION

Van Kuilenburg et al. (1999) studied the expression of DPD in various
blood cell components. They demonstrated that the highest level of DPD
was found in monocytes followed by that in lymphocytes, granulocytes,
and platelets, whereas no significant activity of DPD could be detected
in erythrocytes. The activity of DPD in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells was intermediate between that observed in monocytes and
lymphocytes. Van Kuilenburg et al. (1999) also observed a profound
positive correlation between the DPD activity of these cells and the
percentage of monocytes, thus introducing a large inter- and
intrapatient variability in the activity of DPD.

By cDNA microarray, Western blot analysis, and luciferase reporter
assay, Yoo et al. (2009) identified the transcription factor LSF (TFCP2;
189889) as a positive regulator of DPYD.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Dutch patient with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency
(274270) reported by Van Gennip et al. (1994), Meinsma et al. (1995)
identified homozygosity for a mutation in the DPYD gene (IVS14+1G-A;
612779.0001). Both unaffected parents and 1 unaffected sib were
heterozygous for the mutation.

Wei et al. (1996) identified heterozygosity for the IVS14+1G-A mutation
in a British cancer patient with partial DPD deficiency and severe
toxicity after 5-fluorouracil treatment (see 274270).

Vreken et al. (1997) identified a 4-bp deletion in the DPYD gene
(612779.0003) in affected members of a Dutch consanguineous family with
DPD deficiency.

Among a group of 22 patients from 17 families with complete DPD
deficiency, Van Kuilenburg et al. (1999) identified 7 different
mutations in the DPYD gene. The most common mutation by far, accounting
for 52% of mutant alleles, was the IVS14+1G-A. There were no
genotype/phenotype correlations.

Van Kuilenburg et al. (2009) identified intragenic deletions of the DPYD
gene in 4 patients with severe DPD deficiency in whom no point mutations
were found. Three patients had a homozygous 13.8-kb deletion of exon 12,
and 1 had a homozygous 122-kb deletion of exons 14 through 16 of the
DPYD gene. All of these patients were born of consanguineous parents. A
fifth patient was compound heterozygous for a 4-bp deletion
(612779.0003) in the DPYD gene and a de novo 14-Mb deletion of
chromosome 1p21.3-p13.3, including DPYD and several other genes, which
likely contributed to severe psychomotor retardation and unusual
craniofacial features in this patient. Overall, the study found genomic
deletions affecting the DPYD gene in 7% (5 of 72) of DPD-deficient
patients. These patients had a severe form of the disorder, with
psychomotor retardation, epilepsy, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features,
suggesting that gross deletions have a particularly detrimental effect.

NOMENCLATURE

To standardize DPYD allele nomenclature and to conform with the
international human gene nomenclature guidelines, McLeod et al. (1998)
described an alternative to the existing arbitrary system. Based on
recommendations for human genome nomenclature, they proposed that each
distinct allele be designed by DPYD followed by an asterisk and an
arabic numeral. Criteria for classification as a distinct allele were
also presented.

Meinsma et al. (1995) determined the molecular basis of
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency (274270) by studying the
phenotype and genotype of a family of a patient with no DPD activity.
Fibroblast mRNAs from the patient and 4 family members were subjected to
RT-PCR using primers generated from the human DPYD cDNA sequence. In the
patient, DPYD mRNA was found to lack a segment of 165 nucleotides as a
result of exon skipping. In the parents and 1 sib, DPYD mRNA was found
to be heterozygous for the deletion, while a brother had only normal
transcript. The deficient patient had no detectable DPD protein. The
precise nature of the presumed splicing defect was not identified. The
homozygous proband, who was first described by van Gennip et al. (1994),
had been admitted to hospital at the age of 25 months with bilateral
microphthalmia, coloboma of the iris and choroid, nystagmus, and a
gradually increasing psychomotor retardation. No growth retardation or
other neurologic abnormalities were detected. All other members of the
pedigree were healthy and showed no ocular abnormalities.

Wei et al. (1996) identified heterozygosity for the 165-nucleotide
deletion in a British a cancer patient with partial DPD deficiency and
severe toxicity after 5-fluorouracil treatment (see 274270). They found
that a G-to-A transition within the 5-prime splice site of intron 14
resulted in exon skipping and an inactive DPYD allele.

Independently, Vreken et al. (1996) showed that the 165-nucleotide
deletion in the mature DPD mRNA was due to a G-to-A transition in the
invariant GT dinucleotide splice donor site downstream of the skipped
exon. The same mutation was identified in another, unrelated, Dutch
patient. Because this mutation destroyed a unique MaeII restriction
site, rapid screening was possible using restriction enzyme cleavage of
the amplified genomic region encompassing this mutation. Analysis of 50
controls revealed no individuals heterozygous for the mutation. Although
both patients had psychomotor retardation, the other features were
different. The second patient presented with convulsions and had no
ocular manifestations and no microcephaly.

Van Kuilenburg et al. (1997) described another patient with severe
5-fluorouracil-related toxicity and heterozygosity for the same G-to-A
splice site mutation with a deletion of 165 basepairs. Hyperpigmentation
and cardiotoxicity were observed as side effects of 5-fluorouracil in
this patient. The enzyme activity in leukocytes of the patient proved to
be in the heterozygous range. The patients came from Denmark, Finland,
and the Netherlands. The authors stated that the G-to-A mutation had
been found in 8 of 11 patients with complete deficiency of the enzyme.

Vreken et al. (1998) stated that the deletion of exon 14 due to the
G-to-A mutation had been identified in 22 of 42 alleles from patients
with complete DPD deficiency.

Van Kuilenburg et al. (1999) found that the IVS14+1G-A mutation, leading
to deletion of exon 14 of the DPYD gene, accounted for 23 of 44 (52%)
DPD deficiency alleles.

.0002
5-@FLUOROURACIL TOXICITY
DPYD, ASP974VAL

In a patient who experienced severe 5-fluorouracil-related toxicity (see
274270), Harris et al. (1991) and Albin et al. (1995) identified a
mutation in the DPYD gene resulting in an asp974-to-val (D974V)
substitution. The aspartic acid residue at codon 974 is not within the
putative catalytic sites of the protein, but the amino acid is conserved
in the human, pig, and cow sequences.

Ridge et al. (1997) studied the frequency of the D974V mutation in 29
Scottish subjects with low DPD enzyme activity and in 274 American
subjects. They detected no mutations in the 606 alleles studied and
concluded that mutations at codon 974 are a rare event.

.0003
DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
DPYD, 4-BP DEL, 296TCAT

In a Dutch consanguineous family with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
deficiency (274270), Vreken et al. (1997) identified a 4-bp deletion
(296delTCAT) in the DPYD gene, resulting in premature termination. The
deletion was located in a TCAT tandem-repeat sequence and most likely
resulted from unequal crossing over or slipped mispairing. Three
homozygous individuals were identified in the family. Two of these
showed convulsive disorders, but 1 was clinically normal. No clear
correlation between DPYD genotype and phenotype was possible. Van
Kuilenburg et al. (2009) referred to this mutation as 299delTCAT.

.0004
DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
DPYD, CYS29ARG

Vreken et al. (1997) described 2 patients with DPD deficiency (274270)
who were both compound heterozygotes for a cys29-to-arg (C29R)
substitution and the common splice donor site mutation (612779.0001).
Only one of these patients showed a convulsive disorder during
childhood, whereas the other showed no clinical phenotype, further
illustrating the lack of correlation between genotype and phenotype in
DPD deficiency.

Vreken et al. (1997) described another patient who was a compound
heterozygote for C29R and an R886H substitution (612779.0006). The
patient had been hospitalized for upper airway infection and was being
investigated for unexplained hypokalemia. However, there were no
convulsions or other neurologic abnormalities. By assaying recombinant
C29R mutant enzyme, they found that C29R had no detectable DPYD
activity; however, R886H showed activity about 40% of normal. The
authors concluded that the C29R mutation alone was sufficient to explain
the DPD-deficient phenotype and that the R886H mutation was probably a
rare polymorphism.

.0005
DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
DPYD, 1-BP DEL, 1897C

In a child with DPD deficiency (274270), born of consanguineous parents,
Vreken et al. (1997) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (1897delC) in
the DPYD gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation. At
the age of 9 months the patient showed febrile convulsions, severe
neuromotor retardation, and spastic tetraplegia. Cerebral MRI showed
ventriculomegaly with white matter hypodensity. At the age of 6 years,
thymine-uraciluria was noted and DPD deficiency was demonstrated in
fibroblasts. An earlier-born child had died before her first birthday
with severe neuromotor retardation and febrile convulsions.
Surprisingly, the father of the patient was also completely DPD
deficient, although he had no history of convulsions. The mother of the
patient showed intermediate DPD activity consistent with obligate
carrier status. The patient was heterozygous for this 1-bp deletion,
whereas the father was thought to be homozygous. The nature of the
heterozygous mutation carried by the mother and transmitted to the son
was not determined.

.0006
DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
DPYD, ARG886HIS

Vreken et al. (1997) described a patient who was a compound heterozygote
for a C29R mutation (612779.0004) and an arg886-to-his (R886H)
substitution. By assaying recombinant C29R mutant enzyme, they found
that C29R had no detectable DPYD activity; however, R886H showed
activity about 40% of normal. The authors concluded that the C29R
mutation alone was sufficient to explain the DPD-deficient phenotype and
that the R886H mutation was probably a rare polymorphism.

601836	TITLE *601836 KINESIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; KIFAP3
;;KAP3;;
smg GDS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; SMAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system, Shimizu et al. (1996) isolated the gene
encoding a protein which interacts with smg GDS (see 179502) and named
it SMAP, for 'smg GDS-associated protein.' The cDNA encodes a 792-amino
acid polypeptide containing 9 Armadillo repeats, found in the Drosophila
'Armadillo' protein and implicated in protein-protein interactions. SMAP
protein is phosphorylated by v-src (SRC; 190090), and this
phosphorylation reduces the affinity of SMAP for smg GDS. Northern blot
and tissue distribution analyses revealed that SMAP is expressed
ubiquitously and is highly concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum.
Shimizu et al. (1996) also noted that SMAP is homologous to the sea
urchin gene SpKAP115, an accessory subunit of sea urchin kinesin.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KIFAP3
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP WI-6302).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the KIFAP3
gene and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), see 105400.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mutations in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1; 147450) gene cause
familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS1; 105400), likely due to the
toxic properties of misfolded mutant SOD1 protein. Tateno et al. (2009)
demonstrated that, starting from the pre-onset stage of ALS, misfolded
SOD1 species associated specifically with Kifap3 in the ventral white
matter of SOD1G93A-transgenic mouse spinal cord. KIFAP3 is responsible
for binding to cargoes including choline acetyltransferase (CHAT;
118490) as a component of the kinesin-2 motor complex. Motor axons in
SOD1G93A-Tg mice also showed a reduction in ChAT transport from the
pre-onset stage. Using a purified hybrid mouse neuroblastoma/rat glioma
cell line NG108-15 transfected with SOD1 mutations, the authors showed
that microtubule-dependent release of acetylcholine was significantly
impaired by misfolded SOD1 species and that impairment was normalized by
KIFAP3 overexpression. KIFAP3 was incorporated into SOD1 aggregates in
spinal motor neurons from human ALS patients as well. Tateno et al.
(2009) suggested that KIFAP3 sequestration by misfolded SOD1 species and
the resultant inhibition of ChAT transport play a role in the
pathophysiology of ALS.

;;TESTICAN 2;;
KIAA0275
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteoglycans, which consist of a core protein and covalently linked
glycosaminoglycans, are components of the extracellular matrix. SPOCK2
encodes a member of a novel Ca(2+)-binding proteoglycan family (summary
by Vannahme et al., 1999).

CLONING

By screening an immature myeloid cell line for cDNAs with the potential
to encode large proteins, Nagase et al. (1996) identified a SPOCK2 cDNA,
which they called KIAA0275, encoding a protein with sequence similarity
to testican (SPOCK1; 602264) and with a thyroglobulin type-1 repeat.
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in brain, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening a human brain cDNA library with a fragment of an EST
showing sequence similarity to the follistatin-like domain of a
BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin (182120), Vannahme et al. (1999) cloned a SPOCK2
cDNA, which they called testican-2, encoding a deduced precursor protein
of 424 amino acids with a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a calculated
molecular mass of 46.8 kD. The mature 402-amino acid protein has 5
domains: a follistatin-like domain, a Ca(2+)-binding domain, a
thyroglobulin-like domain, and a C-terminal region with 2 putative
glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The SPOCK2 protein shares 43%
overall sequence identity with SPOCK1. Northern blot analysis of adult
mouse tissues revealed expression of a major 6.1-kb transcript at high
levels in brain and at low levels in lung and testis. Minor bands of 4.4
and 2.6 kb were also detected. In situ hybridization demonstrated
widespread expression in multiple neuronal cell types in olfactory bulb,
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla. A
recombinant fragment consisting of the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand domain and
the thyroglobulin-like domain showed a reversible Ca(2+)-dependent
conformational change in circular dichroism studies.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the SPOCK2
gene to chromosome 10. By sequence analysis, Vannahme et al. (1999)
localized the gene to 10q21-q23.

601530	TITLE *601530 SEQUESTOSOME 1; SQSTM1
;;UBIQUITIN-BINDING PROTEIN P62; P62
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Src homology type 2 (SH2) domain is a highly conserved motif of
about 100 amino acids which mediates protein-protein interactions by
binding to phosphotyrosine. p56-lck (153390), a T-cell-specific src
family tyrosine kinase with an SH2 domain, is involved in T-cell signal
transduction. A 62-kD protein (p62) was identified by Park et al. (1995)
as a ligand of the p56-lck SH2 domain.

Joung et al. (1996) cloned the gene for p62 by purifying the p62 protein
to obtain peptide microsequences, producing a PCR product with
degenerate oligonucleotides, and then using this PCR product to screen a
HeLa cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis of full-length cDNAs by Joung
et al. (1996) revealed that the p62 gene encodes a 440-amino acid
polypeptide with the following conserved domains: (1) a cysteine-rich
domain, predicted to be a metal-binding site involved in protein-protein
or protein-DNA interaction; (2) a region with homology to the cdc42
GTPase binding-site; and (3) a PEST motif which is a degradation signal
found in many short-lived proteins. Northern blot analysis suggested
that p62 is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues examined.

Gong et al. (1999) screened a yeast 2-hybrid library made from rat
hippocampal mRNA against full-length Kv-beta-2 (601142). Two previously
unknown interacting proteins were identified, one of which was identical
to Zip (PKC-zeta (176982)-interacting protein), the rat homolog of p62.
Zip1 and Zip2, which arise from alternative splicing, are identical
except for 27 residues missing from Zip2.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (1995) found that the p56-lck SH2 domain binds to p62 at the
ser59 of p62 only when that serine is phosphorylated. Moreover, Park et
al. (1995) found that p62 is associated with a serine/threonine kinase
activity and also binds to ras GTP-ase-activating protein, a negative
regulator of the ras signaling pathway.

Joung et al. (1996) expressed epitope-tagged p62 in HeLa cells and
showed that the expressed protein bound to the lck SH2 domain and that
this binding was dependent on the N-terminal 50 amino acids of p62 but
not on the tyrosine residue in this region. Thus Joung et al. (1996)
proposed that the mechanism of binding of p62 to the p56-lck SH2 domain
is by a mechanism different from the previously characterized modes of
binding of SH2 domains and their ligands.

Vadlamudi et al. (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify
proteins that interact with p62. They isolated 46 clones that tested
positively for specific interaction with p62. Forty-three of the 46
clones were found by sequencing to be members of the ubiquitin family.
Ubiquitination of cellular proteins is a crucial feature in regulation
of signal transduction and cell cycle progression through
ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of important cellular
proteins. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) studied the interaction of p62 with
ubiquitin by in vitro binding studies which showed that p62 binds
noncovalently to ubiquitin. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) noted that p62
contains no homology with any known ubiquitin-binding protein and thus
represents a new class of ubiquitin-binding protein.

Gong et al. (1999) found that the rat Zip1 and Zip2 isoforms
differentially stimulated phosphorylation of Kv-beta-2 by PKC-zeta. Zip1
and Zip2 interacted to form heteromultimers, allowing for a hybrid
stimulatory activity to PKC-zeta. Gong et al. (1999) found that Zip1 and
Zip2 coexisted in the same cell type and were elevated differentially by
neurotrophic factors. They suggested that these results provide a
mechanism for specificity and regulation of PKC-zeta-targeted
phosphorylation.

By small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Rab factors in a murine
macrophage line, Pilli et al. (2012) showed that inhibition of Rab8b
(613532) caused a decrease in conversion of Mycobacterium bovis BCG
phagosomes to degradative compartments after the induction of autophagy
and autophagic killing of mycobacteria. Knockdown of Rab8b-interacting
partners showed that Tbk1 (604834) was critical for autophagic killing
of BCG by suppressing the maturation of autophagosomes.
Coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation in situ analysis, and confocal
microscopy revealed that Tbk1 associated with Rab8b on autophagic
organelles. High-content imaging analysis showed that Tbk1 was required
in bone marrow macrophages for phosphorylation of p62 on ser403, which
was in turn required for autophagic function and clearance of p62 and
associated cargo. Further analysis revealed that Il1b was necessary for
the induction of autophagy in mycobacteria-infected macrophages and that
Tbk1 was required for Il1b-induced autophagic elimination of M.
tuberculosis.

Lee et al. (2012) showed that the atypical (i.e., nontuberculous)
mycobacterium M. abscessus (Mabc) robustly activated the NLRP3 (606416)
inflammasome in human macrophages via dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264)/SYK
(600085)-dependent signaling and the cytoplasmic scaffold protein
SQSTM1. Both dectin-1 and TLR2 (603028) were required for Mabc-induced
expression of IL1B (147720), CAMP (600474), and DEFB4 (DEFB4A; 602215).
Dectin-1-dependent SYK signaling, but not MYD88 (602170) signaling, led
to activation of CASP1 (147678) and secretion of IL1B through a
potassium efflux-dependent NLRP3/ASC (PYCARD; 606838) inflammasome.
Mabc-induced SQSTM1 expression was also critically involved in NLRP3
inflammasome activation. Lee et al. (2012) concluded that the NLRP3/ASC
inflammasome is critical for antimicrobial responses and innate immunity
to Mabc infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

The 2,870-nucleotide SQSTM1 transcript is contained within 8 exons
distributed over a 16-kb genomic segment (Laurin et al., 2002).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the p62
gene to chromosome 5q35 (TMAP sts-Z40707).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using 24 French Canadian families and 112 unrelated individuals with
Paget disease of bone (602080), Laurin et al. (2002) confined the PDB3
locus (602080) on 5q35-qter to a region of approximately 300 kb. Within
this interval, 2 disease-related haplotype signatures were observed in
11 families and 18 unrelated patients. This region encoded the SQSTM1
gene, which is a candidate gene for PDB because of its association with
the RANK pathway (see 603499). Screening SQSTM1 for mutations led to the
identification of a recurrent nonconservative change (P392L;
601530.0001) flanking the ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA; position
394-440) of the protein that was not present in 291 control individuals.
The data demonstrated that 2 independent mutational events at the same
position in SQSTM1 cause Paget disease of bone in a high proportion of
French Canadian patients.

Kurihara et al. (2007) found that osteoclast precursors from PDB
patients with the P392L mutation and osteoclast precursors transduced
with p62 protein carrying the P392L mutation were hyperresponsive to
RANKL (TNFSF11; 602642) and TNF (191160) compared with control
osteoclast precursors. Mice transgenic for P392L developed increased
osteoclast numbers and progressive bone loss, but they did not manifest
the increased osteoblast numbers seen in PDB. Kurihara et al. (2007)
concluded that expression of P392L in osteoclasts is necessary to cause
predisposition to PDB, but it is not sufficient for the full PDB
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inactivation of constitutive autophagy results in formation of
cytoplasmic protein inclusions and leads to liver injury and
neurodegeneration. Using proteomic, immunoprecipitation, and
immunofluorescence microscopy analyses, Komatsu et al. (2007) found that
p62 interacted with LC3 (MAP1LC3A; 601242) in mouse lysosomes and
autophagosomes. p62 accumulated in autophagy-deficient mouse livers and
neurons lacking Atg5 (604261) or Atg7 (608760). Mice lacking p62 were
fertile and lived more than 1 year, although they developed adult-onset
obesity and diabetes. p62 -/- Atg7 -/- double-knockout mice did not
accumulate ubiquitin protein inclusions in neurons or livers. Komatsu et
al. (2007) concluded that p62 levels are regulated by autophagy and that
the pathology of autophagy deficiency is cell type specific.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, PRO392LEU

In 8 families showing linkage of Paget disease (602080) to the PDB3
locus on 5q, Laurin et al. (2002) used a haplotype signature strategy to
find ancestral haplotypes shared by affected individuals to narrow the
mapping interval. The SQSTM1 gene, which maps to that interval, was
found to have a C-to-T transition at position 1215 in exon 8 in all 5
affected individuals tested. This change caused the substitution of
proline-392 to a leucine (P392L). The P392L mutation was found in 18
(16%) of 112 sporadic cases and in 11 (46%) of 24 families with Paget
disease tested. Haplotype analysis by means of intragenic SNPs showed
that the P392L mutation was associated with 2 distinct haplotypes and
probably originated from 2 independent events. This mutation, occurring
at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide, may have arisen by deamination of a
methylated cytosine.

.0002
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, 1-BP INS, 1224T

Hocking et al. (2002) identified 4 of 62 PDB (602080) families whose
affected members were heterozygous for a T insertion after base 1224 in
the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in premature
termination at codon 396 in the ubiquitin-binding domain.

.0003
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, IVS7, G-A, +1

Hocking et al. (2002) identified an Australian family with PDB (602080)
whose affected members were heterozygous for a G-to-A substitution at
splice donor site IVS7+1 of the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in skipping of exon 7, which encodes part of the
ubiquitin-binding domain.

604142	TITLE *604142 TYRO PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE-BINDING PROTEIN; TYROBP
;;DNAX-ACTIVATION PROTEIN 12; DAP12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Natural killer (NK) cells express cell surface receptors that recognize
major histocompatibility complex class I peptides (e.g., 142800) and
inhibit NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. NK cell receptors belong to 2
distinct groups: the immunoglobulin superfamily for the killer cell
inhibitory receptors (KIRs; e.g., 602992), and the C-type lectin
superfamily for the NKG2 receptors (e.g., 161555). These inhibitory
receptors possess 'immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs'
(ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic domains that recruit SH2 domain-containing
protein-tyrosine phosphatases, resulting in inactivation of NK cells.
Certain isoforms of NK cell receptors lack ITIM sequences, and these
non-inhibitory receptors activate, rather than inhibit, NK cells. Cell
surface immunoglobulin receptors, T-cell antigen receptors (e.g.,
186880), and certain Fc receptors noncovalently associate with small
transmembrane proteins, such as CD3-delta (CD3D; 186790), -gamma (CD3G;
186740), -epsilon (CD3E; 186830), -zeta (CD3Z; 186780), CD79-alpha
(112205), -beta (147245), and FCER1G (147139), that contain an
'immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif' (ITAM) sequence and are
required for signal transduction by these receptor complexes. Lanier et
al. (1998) hypothesized that non-inhibitory NK cell receptors might
require an associated protein with similar properties to mediate
positive signal transduction. By searching an EST database with the
protein sequences of CD3D, CD3G, CD3E, CD3Z, and FCER1G, they isolated a
human CD1+ dendritic cell EST encoding an ITAM-containing protein, which
they named DAP12. The predicted 113-amino acid DAP12 protein is composed
of a signal peptide, a 14-amino acid extracellular domain, a
transmembrane segment, and a 48-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Although
DAP12 shares less than 25% similarity with the human CD3D, CD3G, CD3E,
CD3Z, and FCER1G proteins, its cytoplasmic domain contains a sequence
that precisely corresponds to the prototype ITAM consensus. Potential
sites for phosphorylation are also present in the DAP12 cytoplasmic
region. The transmembrane domain of DAP12 contains the charged amino
acid aspartic acid, which is conserved in the transmembrane domain of
the CD3 subunits.

Tomasello et al. (1998) cloned the full-length coding sequence of mouse
Tyrobp, which they called Karap for 'killer cell-activating
receptor-associated protein.' The deduced human and mouse TYROBP
proteins are 73% identical and are more similar to CD3Z and FCER1G than
to other known ITAM-bearing molecules. RT-PCR analysis of a variety of
hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic mouse cell lines revealed almost
ubiquitous expression of Tyrobp.

GENE FUNCTION

Lanier et al. (1998) demonstrated that the DAP12 protein is expressed on
the cell surface as a disulfide-bonded homodimer. DAP12 noncovalently
associated with KIR2DS2, a KIR family member that lacks an ITIM.
Crosslinking of KIR2DS2/DAP12 complexes, but not of KIR2DS2 alone,
resulted in cellular activation, as indicated by tyrosine
phosphorylation of cellular proteins and upregulation of
early-activation antigens. In addition, crosslinking of KIR2DS2/DAP12
complexes induced tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12 and resulted in the
association of phosphorylated DAP12 with the protein-tyrosine kinase SYK
(600085). Peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of DAP12
formed complexes with the protein-tyrosine kinases SYK and ZAP70
(176947) only if the tyrosine residues in the ITAM of DAP12 were
phosphorylated. Northern blot analysis detected an abundant 0.7-kb DAP12
transcript in human peripheral blood leukocytes and spleen but not in
thymus or the other tissues examined. The authors found DAP12 expression
in human NK cell lines but not in a T leukemia cell line or a B
lymphoblastoid cell line. Lanier et al. (1998) suggested that DAP12
associates with the non-inhibitory isoforms of the KIR molecules in NK
cells and permits cellular activation through these receptors, in a way
similar to the function of the CD3 subunits in the T-cell receptor
complex and the CD79 subunits in the B-cell receptor complex.

DAP12 associates with the cell surface receptor TREM2 (605086), and the
DAP12-TREM2 complex is involved in dendritic cell maturation. Paloneva
et al. (2003) analyzed differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells from DAP12- and TREM2-deficient Finnish or German polycystic
lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy
(PLOSL; 221770) patients into osteoclasts. They found that homozygous
loss-of-function mutations in DAP12 or TREM2 resulted in inefficient,
aberrant, and delayed differentiation into osteoclasts and significantly
diminished bone resorption capability in vitro. RT-PCR analysis detected
no differences between patient and control cells in the expression of
several genes, but expression of DAP12 and TREM2 increased in control
cells during osteoclastic differentiation. Paloneva et al. (2003)
concluded that the DAP12-TREM2 signaling complex is important in the
differentiation and function of osteoclasts.

MAPPING

Lanier et al. (1998) stated that the human TYROBP genomic sequence is
contained within a cosmid (GenBank GENBANK AD000833) that maps to
19q13.1. By FISH, Tomasello et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Tyrobp gene
to 7B. They noted that human 19q13 shows homology of synteny with mouse
chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing
leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL; 221770), also known as Nasu-Hakola disease,
is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by a combination of
psychotic symptoms rapidly progressing to presenile dementia and bone
cysts restricted to wrists and ankles. Identification of a shared 153-kb
ancestor haplotype in all Finnish disease alleles on 19q13.1 was the
first step in characterizing the molecular defect. The TYROBP gene was
one of those located in the critical DNA region for PLOSL. Paloneva et
al. (2000) failed to obtain products by PCR amplification of the coding
region of TYROBP in the genomic DNA of Finnish PLOSL patients with
primers flanking exons 1-4, whereas exon 5 was amplified normally. This
indicated that the patients carried a homozygous deletion encompassing
exons 1-4 of TYROBP (604142.0001). They located the 5-prime deletion
breakpoint 2,900 bp upstream of the initiation methionine, and the
3-prime breakpoint in the last intron of TYROBP, 1,300 bp upstream of
the termination codon. Sequence analysis of the 342-bp coding region of
TYROBP from the genomic DNA of a Japanese PLOSL patient demonstrated
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in exon 3 (604142.0002). This mutation
created a frameshift in the open reading frame, predicting premature
termination of the polypeptide chain after 52 amino acids. The mutation
also changed the aspartic acid residue in the transmembrane domain that
is essential in mediating the interaction between the TYROBP homodimer
and the associated ligand-binding receptors on the surface of natural
killer (NK) cells. On the plasma membrane of NK cells, TYROBP associates
with activating receptors recognizing major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class III molecules. No abnormalities in NK cell function were
detected in PLOSL patients homozygous for a null allele of TYROBP. In 1
Norwegian and 1 Swedish patient with the typical clinical features of
PLOSL, linkage to 19q13.1 was excluded, and no sign of mutation of
TYROBP was found in them or their families.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kaifu et al. (2003) noted that DAP12 is expressed in the
monocyte-macrophage lineage, and that osteoclasts and microglial cells
share a myeloid origin, providing a link between lesions in the brain
and bone in patients with presenile dementia with bone cysts due to
mutation in the DAP12 gene. In Dap12 -/- mice, Kaifu et al. (2003) found
progressive osteopetrosis beginning at about 6 weeks of age. Bone marrow
cells of Dap12 -/- mice failed to yield mature or functional osteoclasts
in vitro. Brain sections from mutant mice showed hypomyelinosis,
synaptic degeneration, and immature oligodendrocytes in the region of
the thalamus. The Dap12 -/- mice showed a reduced startle reflex in
response to acoustic stimuli and reduced prepulse inhibition, suggesting
an impairment of sensorimotor gating. Northern blot analysis of brain
tissue from wildtype mice detected Dap12 mRNA in oligodendrocytes and
microglial cells, but not in astrocytes or neurons.

Koga et al. (2004) showed that mice lacking immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-harboring adaptors Fc receptor
common gamma subunit (147139) and DAP12 exhibit severe osteopetrosis
owing to impaired osteoclast differentiation. In osteoclast precursor
cells, Fc receptor-gamma and DAP12 associated with multiple
immunoreceptors and activated calcium signaling through phospholipase
C-gamma (see 172420). Thus, ITAM-dependent costimulatory signals
activated by multiple immunoreceptors are essential for the maintenance
of bone homeostasis. Koga et al. (2004) concluded that RANKL (602642)
and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (120420) are not sufficient to
activate the signals required for osteoclastogenesis.

Hamerman et al. (2005) found that macrophages from Dap12-deficient mice
produced more Tnf (191160), Il6 (147620), and Il12b (161561) after
stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see 603030) with various
pathogen products than did macrophages from wildtype mice. Inflammatory
cytokine production returned to wildtype levels after Dap12
reconstitution, but not after reconstitution with Dap12 lacking the
ITAM. Macrophages lacking Syk, which signals downstream of Dap12, showed
a phenotype identical to that of Dap12-deficient macrophages.
Dap12-deficient mice produced Tnf at the same rate as wildtype mice but
at higher levels in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide
combined with the Tnf-sensitizing agent D-galactosamine, and none
survived endotoxic shock. Three days after infection with Listeria
monocytogenes, Dap12-deficient mice had substantially fewer bacteria in
spleen and liver compared with wildtype mice. Hamerman et al. (2005)
proposed that 1 or more DAP12-pairing receptors negatively regulate
signaling through TLRs. They noted that Nasu-Hakola patients are not
immunodeficient and, based on their findings, suggested that these
patients may have enhanced resistance to certain pathogens.

In contrast to the findings of Hamerman et al. (2005), Turnbull et al.
(2005) found that Dap12 -/- mice were less susceptible to septic shock
induced by simple endotoxemia or cecal ligation and puncture than
wildtype mice. They concluded that, during sepsis, DAP12 signaling
augments the response to microbial products, amplifying inflammation and
contributing to mortality.

Turnbull et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Trem2 were unable to
inhibit cytokine production in response to microbial products. There was
no difference in cytokine production by macrophages from Trem2-deficient
mice and Dap12-deficient mice, leading Turnbull et al. (2006) to
conclude that Trem2 is the receptor operative in the increased
macrophage cytokine production observed in Dap12-deficient cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
POLYCYSTIC LIPOMEMBRANOUS OSTEODYSPLASIA WITH SCLEROSING LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY
TYROBP, EX1-4DEL

In all 26 Finnish patients with PLOSL (221770) as well as in 2 Swedish
patients with known ancestors in Finland, Paloneva et al. (2000) found
homozygosity for a genomic deletion of 5,265 bp, including 343 bp (exons
1-4 and 5-prime untranslated region) of the 604-bp transcribed region of
the TYROBP gene.

.0002
POLYCYSTIC LIPOMEMBRANOUS OSTEODYSPLASIA WITH SCLEROSING LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY
TYROBP, 1-BP DEL, 141G

In a sequence analysis of the 342-bp coding region of the TYROBP gene
from the genomic DNA of a Japanese patient with PLOSL (221770), Paloneva
et al. (2000) found a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 3. The mutation
created a frameshift in the open reading frame, predicting premature
termination of the polypeptide chain after 52 amino acids.

.0003
POLYCYSTIC LIPOMEMBRANOUS OSTEODYSPLASIA WITH SCLEROSING LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY
TYROBP, MET1THR

In 2 unrelated Japanese patients with PLOSL (221770), both born to
consanguineous parents, Kondo et al. (2002) found a T-to-C transition in
the second nucleotide of the TYROBP gene, changing the start codon from
ATG (met) to ACG (thr). The patients had developed neuropsychiatric
signs at age 30 to 35 years and both had x-ray signs of bone cysts.

608537	TITLE *608537 VHL GENE; VHL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The evolutionarily conserved VHL gene encodes 2 protein products, a
30-kD full-length form (p30) and a 19-kD form (p19). The protein
products of the VHL gene play a role in the oxygen-sensing pathway, in
microtubule stability and orientation, tumor suppression, cilia
formation, regulation of senescence, cytokine signaling, collagen IV
(see 120130) regulation, and assembly of a normal extracellular
fibronectin matrix (summary by Nordstrom-O'Brien et al., 2010).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Latif et al. (1993) identified the VHL tumor
suppressor gene. The gene encodes a 213-amino acid protein with a
predicted acidic repeat domain found in the procyclic surface membrane
glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei. The authors identified 2 widely
expressed mRNA transcripts of approximately 6 and 6.5 kb.

Iliopoulos et al. (1995) demonstrated that the product of the VHL gene
is an approximately 30-kD protein.

By screening a rat liver cDNA library, Duan et al. (1995) isolated the
rat VHL gene, which is predicted to encode a 185-amino acid protein. The
rat protein is 88% identical to the aligned 213-amino acid human VHL
gene product. The human and rat proteins had molecular masses of 28 and
21 kD, respectively.

Richards et al. (1996) used in situ hybridization to investigate the
principal sites of VHL expression during embryogenesis. They also
analyzed a variety of fetal tissues for levels of the 2 VHL isoforms,
isoform I, which contains all 3 exons, and isoform II, which contains
only exons 1 and 3. Although VHL expression was found to be ubiquitous,
particularly high levels of expression were detected in the urogenital
system, brain, spinal cord, sensory ganglia, eyes, and bronchial
epithelium. Richards et al. (1996) noted that this expression pattern
correlated to some extent with the pattern of organ involvement in VHL
syndrome but that there were significant differences. Both isoforms of
VHL were detected in all tissues, and the ratio of isoforms was similar
between tissues.

Schoenfeld et al. (1998) identified a second native VHL gene product.
They showed that this 18-kD protein is initiated from the second
translation start site at codon 54, which contains a more conserved
Kozak consensus sequence and thus may serve as a second, internal,
translation initiation site. The significance of a second translation
start site is underscored by the lack of mutations found between the
first and second methionine codons of the VHL gene in both sporadic and
VHL-associated renal carcinomas. This observation suggested that
mutation in this region may not lead to VHL inactivation if translation
could be initiated at the second methionine codon, producing a
functional VHL protein. Furthermore, both the rat and mouse contain only
19 of the 53 amino acids present in this region in the human VHL ORF.
Schoenfeld et al. (1998) concluded that the 18-kD protein contains the
biologic activity of the VHL gene.

Iliopoulos et al. (1998) also demonstrated that in addition to the
213-amino acid VHL protein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kD
(VHL30), a second VHL protein (VHL19) resulted from internal translation
from the second methionine within the VHL ORF. VHL30 resides primarily
in the cytosol, with lower amounts found in the nucleus or associated
with cell membranes. In contrast, VHL19 is equally distributed between
the nucleus and cytosol and is not found in association with membranes.
VHL19, like VHL30, can bind to elongin B (600787), elongin C (600788),
and Hs-Cul2 in coimmunoprecipitation assays and can inhibit the
production of hypoxia-inducing proteins such as VEGF (192240) and GLUT1
(138140) when reintroduced into renal carcinoma cells that lack a
wildtype VHL allele. Thus, cells contain 2 biologically active VHL gene
products.

GENE STRUCTURE

Latif et al. (1993) determined that the VHL gene contains at least 3
exons.

Zatyka et al. (2002) analyzed the promoter region of the VHL gene and
found 4 regions of conservation between human, primate, and rodent
sequences. In silico analysis identified binding sites for numerous
transcription factors within the conserved regions, and deletion
analysis of the promoter in a reporter assay in 293 and HeLa cells
identified 1 negative and 2 positive regulatory elements. The promoter
contains a functional SP1 (189906) site and overlapping SP1/AP2 (107580)
sites.

GENE FUNCTION

- Role in Tumor Suppression

Maher et al. (1990) compared age incidence curves for sporadic
cerebellar hemangioblastoma and sporadic renal cell carcinoma to those
for familial forms of these tumors that occur as part of von
Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300). The curves for tumors in VHL syndrome
were compatible with a single mutation model, whereas the age incidence
curves for sporadic tumors suggested a 2-stage mutation process. On the
whole, the findings suggested that the VHL gene functions as a recessive
tumor suppressor gene.

Crossey et al. (1994) presented convincing evidence that the VHL
syndrome gene functions as a recessive tumor suppressor gene and that
inactivation of both alleles of the VHL gene is a critical event in the
pathogenesis of VHL neoplasms. Studies of loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
showed that in 7 tumors from 7 familial cases in which the parental
origin of the 3p26-p25 allele loss could be determined, the allele had
been lost from the chromosome inherited from the unaffected parent. In 4
VHL tumors, LOH on other chromosomes (5q21, 13q, 17q) was found,
indicating that homozygous VHL gene mutations may be required but not
sufficient for tumorigenesis in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

When expressed in COS-7 cells, Duan et al. (1995) found that both the
human and the rat VHL proteins showed predominant nuclear, nuclear and
cytosolic, or predominant cytosolic VHL staining by immunofluorescence.
A complicated pattern of cellular proteins was seen that could be
specifically coimmunoprecipitated with the introduced VHL protein. A
complex containing VHL and proteins with apparent molecular masses of 16
and 9 kD was the most consistently observed. Certain naturally occurring
VHL missense mutations demonstrated either complete or partial loss of
the p16-p9 complex. Duan et al. (1995) concluded that the VHL tumor
suppressor gene product is a nuclear protein, perhaps capable of
specifically translocating between the nucleus and the cytosol. They
suggested that VHL may execute its function via formation of specific
multiprotein complexes.

Vogelstein (1995) referred to the VHL gene as a gatekeeper gene for
cancers such as those of the kidney. Rubenstein and Yaari (1994)
suggested that the VHL gene may serve that role in relation to
astrocytoma. They presented the pedigree of a Puerto Rican family in
which at least 9 members had von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and 2 of these
had astrocytoma.

To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying tumor suppression by
the VHL protein, Duan et al. (1995) and Kibel et al. (1995) searched for
cellular proteins that bind to wildtype VHL protein but not to
tumor-derived VHL protein mutants. They found that 2 transcriptional
elongation factors, elongin B (600787) and elongin C (600788), bind in
vitro and in vivo to a short, colinear region of the VHL protein that is
frequently mutated in human tumors. Kibel et al. (1995) showed that a
peptide replica of this region inhibited binding of VHL protein to
elongin B and elongin C, whereas a point-mutant derivative,
corresponding to a naturally occurring VHL missense mutation, had no
effect. Duan et al. (1995) showed that recombinant VHL competes with
elongin A (600786) for elongin B and C binding in vitro. The results
were interpreted as indicating that the normal tumor suppression
function of VHL protein involves the inhibition of transcription
elongation by its binding to elongin B and elongin C.

In a review article, Tyers and Willems (1999) stated that the VHL
protein is part of a complex that includes elongin B, elongin C, and
cullin-2 (CUL2; 603135), proteins that are associated with
transcriptional elongation and ubiquitination. Components of the VCB
(VHL/elongin C/elongin B) complex share sequence similarities with the
E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes SCF (SKP1, (601434); CUL1, (603134); F-box
protein) and APC (anaphase promoting complex; see 603462). Thus, elongin
B is ubiquitin-like, and elongin C and CUL2 are similar to the SKP1 and
CUL1 components of SCF, respectively. Substrate recognition by E3
enzymes such as SCF and APC is crucial because protein degradation must
be highly selective. Both SCF and APC interact with a set of adaptor
proteins that recruit different binding partners through specific
protein-protein interaction domains. SOCS-box-containing proteins (see
603597) may act as adaptors for the VCB complex.

Feldman et al. (1999) demonstrated that the folding and assembly of VHL
into a complex with its partner proteins, elongin B and elongin C, is
directly mediated by the chaperonin TRiC, also called CCT (see 600114).
Association of VHL with TRiC is required for formation of the
VHL-elongin B-elongin C complex. A 55-amino acid domain of VHL (amino
acids 100 to 155) is both necessary and sufficient for binding to TRiC.
Mutation or deletion of this domain is associated with VHL syndrome, and
2 mutations that disrupt the normal interaction with TRiC and impair VHL
folding were identified. These results defined a novel role for TRiC in
mediating oligomerization and suggested that inactivating mutations can
impair polypeptide function by interfering with chaperone-mediated
folding.

Lee et al. (1996) demonstrated that there is a tightly regulated,
cell-density-dependent transport of the VHL protein into and/or out of
the nucleus. In densely grown cells, it is predominantly in the
cytoplasm, whereas in sparse cultures, most of the protein can be
detected in the nucleus. They identified a putative nuclear localization
signal in the first 60 and first 28 amino acids of the human and rat VHL
protein, respectively. Sequences in the C-terminal region of VHL protein
may also be required for localization to the cytosol. The findings
indicated a novel cell-density-dependent pathway responsible for the
regulation of VHL cellular localization.

Iliopoulos et al. (1995) showed that the renal cell carcinoma cell line
786-O, which is known to harbor a VHL mutation, fails to produce a
wildtype VHL protein. Reintroduction of wildtype, but not mutant, VHL
into these cells had no demonstrable effect on their growth in vitro but
inhibited their ability to form tumors in nude mice. Like many cancer
cells, the 786-0 RCC fails to exit the cell cycle upon serum withdrawal.
Pause et al. (1998) showed that reintroduction of the wildtype VHL gene
restores the ability of VHL-negative RCC cells to exit the cell cycle
and enter G0/quiescence in low serum. The cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p27 (CDKN1B; 600778) accumulates upon serum withdrawal, only
in the presence of VHL, as a result of an increase in protein stability.
Pause et al. (1998) proposed that loss of the wildtype VHL gene results
in a specific cellular defect in serum-dependent growth control, which
may initiate tumor formation. Thus, VHL appears to be the first tumor
suppressor involved in the regulation of cell cycle exit, which is
consistent with its gatekeeper function in the kidney.

To discover genes involved in VHL-mediated carcinogenesis, Ivanov et al.
(1998) used renal cell carcinoma cell lines stably transfected with
wildtype VHL-expressing transgenes. Large-scale RNA differential display
technology applied to these cell lines identified several differentially
expressed genes, including an alpha carbonic anhydrase gene, termed CA12
(603263). The deduced protein sequence was classified as a one-pass
transmembrane carbonic anhydrase possessing an apparently intact
catalytic domain in the extracellular CA module. Reintroduced wildtype
VHL strongly inhibited the overexpression of the CA12 gene in the
parental renal cell carcinoma cell lines. Similar results were obtained
with CA9 (603179) which encodes another transmembrane carbonic anhydrase
with an intact catalytic domain. Although both domains of the VHL
protein contributed to regulation of CA12 expression, the elongin
binding domain alone could effectively regulate CA9 expression. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ivanov et al. (1998) mapped CA12 and
CA9 to chromosome bands 15q22 and 17q21.2, respectively, regions prone
to amplification in some human cancers. Ivanov et al. (1998) stated that
additional experiments were necessary to define the role of CA IX and CA
XII enzymes in the regulation of pH in the extracellular
microenvironment and its potential impact on cancer cell growth.

Roe et al. (2006) found that VHL directly associated with and stabilized
p53 (TP53; 191170) by suppressing MDM2 (164785)-mediated ubiquitination
and nuclear export of p53. Moreover, upon genotoxic stress, VHL invoked
an interaction between p53 and p300 (EP300; 602700) and the acetylation
of p53, which led to an increase in p53 transcriptional activity and
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Roe et al. (2006) concluded that VHL
has a function in upregulating p53.

Yang et al. (2007) noted that VHL-defective renal carcinoma cells
exhibit increased NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activity, which can promote
resistance to chemotherapy or cytokines. They showed that VHL
downregulates NF-kappa-B activity by acting as an adaptor to promote
casein kinase-2 (see 115440)-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of
CARD9 (607212), an NF-kappa-B agonist.

- Role in Oxygen-Related Gene Expression

The highly vascular tumors associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
overproduce angiogenic peptides such as vascular endothelial growth
factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF; 192240). Iliopoulos et
al. (1996) found that renal carcinoma cells lacking wildtype VHL protein
produce mRNAs encoding VEGF/VPF, the glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1;
138140), and the platelet-derived growth factor B chain (190040) under
both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Reintroduction of wildtype, but
not mutant, VHL protein into these cells specifically inhibited
production of these mRNAs under normoxic conditions, thus restoring
their previously described hypoxia-inducible profile. Iliopoulos et al.
(1996) concluded that the VHL protein appears to play a critical role in
the transduction of signals generated by changes in ambient oxygen
tension.

VEGF mRNA is upregulated in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome-associated
tumors. Mukhopadhyay et al. (1997) assessed the effect of the VHL gene
product on VEGF expression. Using a VEGF promoter-luciferase construct
for cotransfection with a wildtype VHL vector in embryonic kidney and
renal cell carcinoma cell lines, they showed that wildtype VHL protein
inhibited VEGF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 5- to
10-fold. Deletion analysis defined a 144-bp region of the VEGF promoter
necessary for VHL repression. This VHL-responsive element is GC rich and
specifically bound the transcription factor Sp1 (189906) in crude
nuclear extracts. They further demonstrated that VHL and Sp1 directly
interact with an inhibitory effect on Sp1, suggesting that loss of Sp1
inhibition may be important in the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau
syndrome and renal cell carcinoma.

Maxwell et al. (1999) studied the involvement of VHL in oxygen-regulated
gene expression using ribonuclease protection analysis of 2
VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cell lines, RCC4 and 786-O. Eleven genes
encoding products involved in glucose transport, glycolysis, high energy
phosphate metabolism, and angiogenesis were examined; 9 were induced by
hypoxia in other mammalian cells and 2 were repressed by hypoxia. None
of these responses were seen in the VHL-defective cell lines. Responses
to hypoxia were restored by stable transfection of a wildtype VHL gene,
with effects ranging from a modest action of hypoxia to substantial
regulation. These results indicated that the previously described
upregulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs in VHL-defective cells extend to
a broad range of oxygen-regulated genes and involves a constitutive
'hypoxia pattern' for both positively and negatively regulated genes.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1; 603348) has a key role in cellular
response to hypoxia, including the regulation of genes involved in
energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. The alpha subunits of
HIF are rapidly degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions but
are stabilized by hypoxia. Cobaltous ions or iron chelators mimic
hypoxia, indicating that the stimuli may interact through effects on a
ferroprotein oxygen sensor. Maxwell et al. (1999) demonstrated a
critical role for the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product
VHL in HIF1 regulation. In VHL-defective cells, HIF-alpha subunits were
constitutively stabilized and HIF1 was activated. Reexpression of VHL
restored oxygen-dependent instability. VHL and HIF-alpha subunits
coimmunoprecipitated, and VHL was present in the hypoxic HIF1
DNA-binding complex. In cells exposed to iron chelation or cobaltous
ions, HIF1 is dissociated from VHL. These findings indicated that the
interaction between HIF1 and VHL is iron dependent and that it is
necessary for the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-alpha subunits.
Maxwell et al. (1999) suggested that constitutive HIF1 activation may
underlie the angiogenic phenotype of VHL-associated tumors.

In the presence of oxygen, HIF is targeted for destruction by an E3
ubiquitin ligase containing the VHL tumor suppressor protein. Ivan et
al. (2001) found that human VHL protein binds to a short HIF-derived
peptide when a conserved proline residue at the core of this peptide is
hydroxylated. Because proline hydroxylation requires molecular oxygen
and iron, this protein modification may play a key role in mammalian
oxygen sensing. Jaakkola et al. (2001) also demonstrated that the
interaction between VHL protein and a specific domain of the HIF1-alpha
subunit is regulated through hydroxylation of a proline residue
(HIF1-alpha P564) by an enzyme which they termed HIF-alpha
prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH). An absolute requirement for dioxygen as a
cosubstrate and iron as a cofactor suggests that HIF-PH functions
directly as a cellular oxygen sensor.

Mahon et al. (2001) showed that the N-terminal 155 residues of VHL
interact with HIF1AN (606615). They found that VHL functions as a
transcriptional corepressor inhibiting HIF1A transactivation by
recruiting HDAC1 (601241), HDAC2 (605164), and HDAC3 (605166). Epstein
et al. (2001) defined a conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in
C. elegans and identified Egl9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by
prolyl hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, they showed that the
HIF-prolyl hydroxylases are represented by 3 proteins, PHD1 (606424),
PHD2 (606425), and PHD3 (606426), with a conserved
2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site.
Direct modulation of recombinant enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron
chelation, and cobaltous ions mirrored the characteristics of HIF
induction in vivo, fulfilling requirements for these enzymes being
oxygen sensors that regulate HIF.

Hoffman et al. (2001) reported that the products of 4 different type 2C
VHL alleles retain the ability to downregulate HIF but are defective for
promotion of fibronectin (135600) matrix assembly. Furthermore, leu188
to val (L188V; 608537.0014), a well-studied type 2C mutation, retained
the ability to suppress renal carcinoma growth in vivo.

Clifford et al. (2001) investigated in detail the effect of 13 naturally
occurring VHL mutations (11 missense), representing each phenotypic
subclass, on HIF-alpha subunit regulation. Mutations associated with the
PHE-only phenotype (type 2C) promoted HIF-alpha ubiquitylation in vitro
and demonstrated wildtype binding patterns with VHL interacting
proteins, suggesting that loss of other VHL functions are necessary for
PHE susceptibility. Mutations causing HAB susceptibility (types 1, 2A,
and 2B) demonstrated variable effects on HIF-alpha subunit and elongin
binding, but all resulted in defective HIF-alpha regulation and loss of
fibronectin binding. All RCC-associated mutations caused complete
HIF-alpha dysregulation and loss of fibronectin binding. These studies
strengthened the notion that HIF deregulation plays a causal role in
hemangioblastoma and renal carcinoma, and raised the possibility that
abnormal fibronectin matrix assembly contributes to pheochromocytoma
pathogenesis in the setting of VHL syndrome.

Hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina in VHL
patients overexpress vascular endothelial growth factor, which
represents a potential target for anti-angiogenic drugs. In 3 VHL
patients with CNS or retinal hemangioblastomas treated by the anti-VEGF
receptor SU5416, Richard et al. (2002) observed, after 3 to 4 months of
treatment, a secondary paradoxical polycythemia. Hematocrit was normal
before the beginning of the trial, and no progression of
hemangioblastomas was observed. Polycythemia had never been reported in
SU5416 trials for advanced malignancies. In the studies of Richard et
al. (2002), the polycythemia may have represented a specific action on
red blood cell precursors occurring only in the absence of a functional
VHL gene.

Staller et al. (2003) demonstrated that the VHL tumor suppressor protein
negatively regulates CXCR4 (162643) expression owing to its capacity to
target HIF1A (603348) for degradation under normoxic conditions. This
process is suppressed under hypoxic conditions, resulting in
HIF-dependent CXCR4 activation. An analysis of clear cell renal
carcinoma that manifests mutations in the VHL gene in most cases
revealed an association of strong CXCR4 expression with poor
tumor-specific survival. Staller et al. (2003) concluded that their
results suggest a mechanism for CXCR4 activation during tumor cell
evolution and imply that VHL inactivation acquired by incipient tumor
cells early in tumorigenesis confers not only a selective survival
advantage but also the tendency to home to selected organs.

Corn et al. (2003) established that the VHL protein binds to Tat-binding
protein-1 (TBP1; 186852). TBP1 associates with the beta-domain of VHL
and complexes with VHL and HIF1A in vivo. Overexpression of TBP1
promotes degradation of HIF1A in a VHL-dependent manner that requires
the ATPase domain of TBP1. Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of the
VHL gene disrupt binding of VHL to TBP1. A VHL protein mutant containing
an exon 2 missense substitution coimmunoprecipitated with HIF1A, but not
TBP1, and did not promote degradation of HIF1A. Thus, the ability of the
VHL protein to degrade HIF1A depends in part on its interaction with
TBP1 and suggests a new mechanism for HIF1A stabilization in some
VHL-deficient tumors.

To identify novel target genes of the VHL protein, Zatyka et al. (2002)
investigated the effect of wildtype VHL protein on the expression of 588
cancer-related genes in 2 VHL-defective renal cell carcinoma cell lines.
Expression array analysis identified 9 genes that demonstrated a greater
than 2-fold decrease in expression in both RCC cell lines after
restoration of wildtype VHL protein. Three of the 9 genes, VEGF, PAI1
(173360), and LRP1 (107770), had previously been reported as targets of
the VHL protein and are hypoxia-inducible. In addition, 6 novel targets
were detected, including cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461). No evidence was
found that CCND1 expression was influenced by hypoxia, suggesting that
VHL protein downregulates these targets by an HIF-independent mechanism.

Homozygous disruption of the Vhl gene in mice results in embryonic
lethality from lack of placental vasculogenesis (Gnarra et al., 1997).
To investigate Vhl function in the adult, Haase et al. (2001) generated
a conditional Vhl-null allele (2-lox allele) and a null allele (1-lox
allele) by Cre-mediated recombination in embryonic stem cells. They
showed that mice heterozygous for the 1-lox allele developed cavernous
hemangiomas of the liver, a rare manifestation in the human disease.
Histologically, these tumors were associated with hepatocellular
steatosis and focal proliferations of small vessels. To study the
cellular origin of these lesions, Haase et al. (2001) inactivated VHL
tissue specifically in hepatocytes. Deletion of VHL in the liver
resulted in severe steatosis, many blood-filled vascular cavities, and
foci of increased vascularization within the hepatic parenchyma. These
histopathologic changes were similar to those seen in livers from mice
heterozygous for the 1-lox allele. Hypoxia-inducible mRNAs encoding
vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter-1, and
erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) were upregulated. Thus, targeted
inactivation of mouse Vhl replicated clinical features of the human
disease and underscored the importance of the VHL gene product in the
regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes in vivo.

Wang et al. (2007) showed that mice overexpressing Hif1a in osteoblasts
through selective deletion of Vhl expressed high levels of Vegf (192240)
and developed extremely dense, heavily vascularized long bones. In
contrast, mice lacking Hif1a in osteoblasts had long bones that were
significantly thinner and less vascularized than those of controls. Loss
of Vhl in osteoblasts increased endothelial sprouting from the embryonic
metatarsals in vitro but had little effect on osteoblast function in the
absence of blood vessels. Wang et al. (2007) concluded that activation
of the HIF1A pathway in osteoblasts during bone development couples
angiogenesis to osteogenesis.

Endocytosis plays a major role in the deactivation of receptors
localized to the plasma membrane, and early endocytic events require the
small GTPase RAB5 (179512) and its effector rabaptin-5 (RABEP1; 603616).
Wang et al. (2009) found that hypoxia, via the VHL-HIF2A (603349)
signaling pathway, downregulated rabaptin-5 expression, leading to
decelerated endocytosis and prolonged activation of ligand-bound EGFR
(131550). Primary kidney and breast tumors with strong hypoxic
signatures showed significantly lower expression of rabaptin-5 RNA and
protein. Wang et al. (2009) identified a conserved hypoxia-responsive
element (HRE) in the rabaptin-5 promoter that bound in vitro-translated
HIF1A and HIF2A, leading to displacement of RNA polymerase II and
attenuating rabaptin-5 transcription.

Mehta et al. (2009) reported that in C. elegans the loss of VHL1
significantly increased life span and enhanced resistance to
polyglutamine and beta-amyloid toxicity. Deletion of HIF1 (603348) was
epistatic to VHL1, indicating that HIF1 acts downstream of VHL1 to
modulate aging and proteotoxicity. VHL1 and HIF1 control longevity by a
mechanism distinct from both dietary restriction and insulin-like
signaling. Mehta et al. (2009) concluded that their findings define VHL1
and the hypoxic response as an alternative longevity and protein
homeostasis pathway.

Russell et al. (2011) demonstrated that VHL binds to SOCS1 (603597) and
promotes degradation of phosphorylated JAK2 (147796) via
ubiquitin-mediated destruction.

- Role in Protein Assembly

Ohh et al. (1998) showed that fibronectin coimmunoprecipitated with
normal VHL protein but not tumor-derived VHL mutants. Immunofluorescence
and biochemical fractionation experiments showed that fibronectin
colocalized with a fraction of VHL associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum, and cold competition experiments suggested that complexes
between fibronectin and VHL protein exist in intact cells. Assembly of
an extracellular fibronectin matrix by VHL -/- renal carcinoma cells, as
determined by immunofluorescence and ELISA assays, was grossly defective
compared with VHL +/+ renal carcinoma cells. Reintroduction of wildtype,
but not mutant, VHL protein into VHL -/- renal carcinoma cells partially
corrected this defect. Extracellular fibronectin matrix assembly by VHL
-/- mouse embryos and mouse embryo fibroblasts, unlike their VHL +/+
counterparts, was grossly impaired. Ohh et al. (1998) concluded that VHL
protein is important in fibronectin matrix assembly.

Hergovich et al. (2003) found that VHL is a microtubule-associated
protein that can protect microtubules from depolymerization in several
cell lines. Both the microtubule binding and stabilization functions
depended on amino acids 95-123, a hotspot for mutations in VHL syndrome.
They found that the syndrome-associated mutations Y98H (608537.0009) and
Y112H (608537.0012) disrupted the microtubule-stabilizing function of
the protein.

- Role in Ciliary Maintenance

Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, Lolkema et al. (2008)
showed that Vhl localized to cilia extending from basal bodies stained
with gamma-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135) in primary mouse kidney cells. Cilia
were absent in renal cell carcinoma cells derived from a VHL patient,
but reintroduction of VHL into these cells resulted in rapid cilia
assembly. The cilia function of VHL required residues 1 to 53, which
constitute an acidic domain, and residues 95 to 123, which were
previously implicated in microtubule binding and tumor suppression.

- Role in Central Nervous System Development

Kanno et al. (2000) investigated the role of the VHL gene in CNS
development using rodent CNS progenitor cells. They showed that
expression of the VHL protein is correlated with neuronal
differentiation but not with glial differentiation in CNS progenitor
cells, and also that VHL gene transduction induces neuronal
differentiation. Furthermore, a VHL mRNA antisense oligonucleotide
inhibited differentiation of CNS progenitor cells and upregulated their
cell cycle.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

The ubiquitination of HIF by VHL plays a central role in the cellular
response to changes in oxygen availability. VHL protein binds to HIF
only when a conserved proline in HIF is hydroxylated, a modification
that is oxygen-dependent. Min et al. (2002) determined the 1.85-angstrom
structure of a 20-residue HIF1A-VHL protein-elongin B-elongin C complex
that shows that HIF1A binds to VHL protein in an extended beta
strand-like conformation. The hydroxyproline inserts into a gap in the
VHL hydrophobic core, at a site that is a hotspot for tumorigenic
mutations, with its 4-hydroxyl group recognized by buried serine and
histidine residues. Although the beta sheet-like interactions contribute
to the stability of the complex, the hydroxyproline contacts are central
to the strict specificity characteristic of signaling.

Hon et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure of a hydroxylated
HIF1A peptide bound to the VHL protein, elongin C, and elongin B and
performed solution binding assays, which revealed a single, conserved
hydroxyproline-binding pocket in the VHL protein. They found that
optimized hydrogen bonding to the buried hydroxyprolyl group confers
precise discrimination between hydroxylated and unmodified prolyl
residues. Hon et al. (2002) concluded that this mechanism provides a new
focus for development of therapeutic agents to modulate cellular
responses to hypoxia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nordstrom-O'Brien et al. (2010) provided a review of the molecular
genetics of the VHL gene, including the mutational spectrum and
associated phenotypes.

- Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome

Using restriction fragment analysis, Latif et al. (1993) identified
rearrangements of the VHL gene in 28 of 221 kindreds with von
Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300). Eighteen of these rearrangements were
due to deletion in the candidate gene. Using pulsed field gel
electrophoresis and cosmid mapping, Latif et al. (1993) established a
physical map of the VHL gene region and identified 3 large
nonoverlapping constitutional deletions in 3 unrelated VHL patients; 1
of these was an in-frame 3-nucleotide deletion at nucleotide 434,
predicted to remove ile146 in the gene product (608537.0001).

Using single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis
to investigate 94 VHL patients without large deletions, Crossey et al.
(1994) identified 40 different mutations in the VHL gene in 55 unrelated
kindreds: 19 missense mutations, 6 nonsense mutations, 12 frameshift
deletions or insertions, 2 in-frame deletions, and 1 splice donor site
mutation. The 2 most frequent mutations were arg238-to-gln (608537.0005)
and arg238-to-trp (608537.0003), which were detected in 5 and 4
unrelated kindreds, respectively.

Olschwang et al. (1998) screened 92 unrelated patients with VHL syndrome
for point mutations and found 61 DNA variants. In addition, a search for
EcoRI rearrangements revealed germline anomalies in 5 patients. The 61
variants could be subdivided into 20 mutations predicted to alter the
open reading frame and 43 DNA sequence variants that on a priori grounds
were of unknown biologic consequence. The 3-prime end of the coding
sequence of the VHL gene, which encodes the elongin (see 600787)-binding
domain, was the site of 5 of 20 truncating mutations (25%) and 18 of 41
DNA variants (44%) of uncertain functional significance. A similar
screening in 18 patients with sporadic hemangioblastoma revealed 2
missense DNA variants.

Wait et al. (2004) performed genetic analysis of 5 CNS hemangioblastomas
excised from 3 related VHL patients with the same germline VHL gene
deletion. All of the tumors showed distinct 'second-hit' point mutations
on the wildtype allele, even those tumors originating in the same
patient. Moreover, the same types of tumors from the same locations also
showed different point mutations. Wait et al. (2004) concluded that the
somatic mutations were random, and that there is a unique mechanism
underlying tumorigenesis in patients with germline deletion mutations.

Using markers specific for chromosome 3, Glasker et al. (2006) mapped
the deletion size of the 'second-hit' in 16 tumor tissue specimens from
a single patient with VHL syndrome who had a germline heterozygous
partial deletion in the VHL gene. The tumors consisted of 3 central
nervous system hemangioblastomas, 7 renal cell carcinomas, 3 cystic
renal structures, 2 pancreatic tumors, and 1 pancreatic cyst. Deletion
size was highly variable, ranging from short deletions around the VHL
gene to complete deletion of chromosome 3. However, there was no
correlation between deletion size and site of the germline mutation,
affected organ, or type or biological behavior of the tumor. Glasker et
al. (2006) concluded that loss of VHL gene function alone is not
immediately causative for neoplastic growth and suggested that further
molecular events may be required for tumor formation.

(For genotype/phenotype correlations in VHL syndrome, see 193300.)

- Cancer

The Knudson model predicts that sporadic cancers should be associated
with mutations in the same locus affected in the corresponding
hereditary cancer. Using SSCP and RT-PCR techniques, Latif et al. (1993)
identified aberrant patterns in the VHL gene in 5 renal cell carcinoma
(RCC) lines. In 4 of them, the pattern was due to small, 1- to
10-nucleotide deletions that created frameshift mutations and,
presumably, truncated proteins. In the fifth RCC line, the change was a
nonsense mutation, resulting from a 761C-A transversion.

Eng et al. (1995) identified mutations in the VHL gene in 4 of 48
sporadic pheochromocytomas (171300). Two mutations were somatic and 2
were germline. In a mother and 2 sons with pheochromocytoma, Crossey et
al. (1995) identified a VHL mutation (R238W; 6085327.0003) mutation.
None of them had evidence of VHL syndrome.

In 30 (11%) of 271 unrelated patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma,
Neumann et al. (2002) identified 22 different germline mutations in the
VHL gene (see, e.g., 608537.0014 and 608537.0026).

Zhuang et al. (1996) analyzed VHL gene alterations in sporadic human
colon carcinomas and adenomas using techniques that allowed for
procurement and analysis of selected subpopulations of cells from
paraffin embedded and frozen human tumor specimens. Allelic loss of the
VHL gene was detected in 7 of 11 (64%) of informative patients with
sporadic colon carcinoma. No allelic loss was shown in colon adenomas
from 8 informative patients. The authors suggested that VHL gene loss
may represent a relatively late event in colonic neoplasia progression.

Oberstrass et al. (1996) found abnormalities of the VHL gene in 10 of 20
capillary hemangioblastomas of the CNS. Seven tumors had a frameshift
mutation due either to deletion of 1 or more basepairs (6 cases) or to
insertion of 1 basepair (1 case). The remaining 3 tumors had either
point mutations with intron splice site sequences (2 cases) or a point
mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution (1 case). Evidence for
germline alterations of the VHL gene was found in 2 patients who showed
identical mutations in both tumors and corresponding leukocyte DNA.
Oberstrass et al. (1996) noted that it is significant that one of the 2
tumors with a germline mutation was in an 18-year-old male, and the
other in a 40-year-old female. The non-germline mutations included
tumors from individuals 70, 62, 60, 55, and 52 years old.

Kenck et al. (1996) investigated 91 different parenchymal tumors of the
kidney for mutation in the VHL gene by SSCP and/or heteroduplex
techniques. Evidence of mutation of the VHL gene was associated
exclusively with nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma.

Fearon (1997) reviewed more than 20 different hereditary cancer
syndromes that had been defined and attributed to specific germline
mutations in various inherited cancer genes. In a useful diagram, he
illustrated the roles of allelic variation ('1 gene - different
syndromes') and genetic heterogeneity ('different genes - 1 syndrome')
in inherited cancer syndromes. VHL mutations were used as an example of
the former: inactivating mutations, such as nonsense mutations or
deletions, predisposed to clear-cell renal carcinoma, retinal angioma,
and cerebellar and spinal hemangioblastoma; missense mutations, e.g., in
codon 167, predisposed to these tumors and pheochromocytoma in addition.

Van der Harst et al. (1998) screened the VHL gene for germline mutations
in 68 patients who were operated on for pheochromocytoma. This was
undertaken to follow up on the work of Neumann et al. (1993), who
reported that, according to clinical criteria, approximately 23% of the
apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas may in fact be related to a
familial disorder; these disorders are, in addition to von Hippel-Lindau
syndrome, neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1; 162200) and multiple endocrine
neoplasia types IIA (MEN2A; 171400) and IIB (MEN2B; 162300). They found
mutations in the VHL gene in 8 patients; 2 patients were an uncle and
nephew who had the same missense mutation, R64P (608537.0015). In 4
other patients, missense mutations, P25L, L63P (608537.0016), G144Q, and
I147T, were identified. Three of these mutations (P25L, L63P, and R64P)
were located closer to the N terminus of the VHL protein than any
previously reported VHL mutation. In 2 other cases, the mutations were
located not in the coding region but in the intronic sequence (but not
within splice sites), adjacent to the exon, so that they were probably
not related to the syndrome. The results suggested that 8.8% of patients
(6 of 68) with apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas may carry germline
mutations in the VHL gene. This is a relatively high proportion,
although not as high as the 23% reported earlier.

Gallou et al. (1999) investigated the nature of somatic VHL mutations in
173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas using PCR and SSCP
analysis. They detected an abnormal SSCP pattern in 73 samples. After
sequencing, they identified microdeletions in 58% of cases,
microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations
in 17%. VHL mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell
carcinoma subtype, as previously reported. To compare somatic and
germline mutations, they used the VHL database, which included 507
mutations. The study of mutational events revealed a significant
difference between somatic and germline mutations. Mutations leading to
truncated proteins were observed in 78% of somatic mutations but in only
37% of germline mutations (P less than 0.001). The authors postulated
that a specific pattern of VHL mutations is associated with sporadic
RCC. This pattern corresponds to mutations leading to truncated
proteins, with few specific missense mutations.

Bender et al. (2000) studied 36 VHL-related pheochromocytomas for
somatic VHL and RET gene alterations and LOH of markers on chromosome
arms 1p, 3p, and 22q. For comparison, they performed the same analyses
in 17 sporadic pheochromocytomas. They found significantly different LOH
frequencies at 3 loci between sporadic and VHL tumors; the more than 91%
LOH of markers on 3p and the relatively low frequencies of LOH at 1p and
22q (15% and 21%, respectively) in VHL pheochromocytomas argue for the
importance of VHL gene dysregulation and dysfunction in the pathogenesis
of almost all VHL pheochromocytomas. In contrast, the relatively low
frequency of 3p LOH (24%) and the lack of intragenic VHL alterations
compared with the high frequency of 1p LOH (71%) and the moderate
frequency of 22q LOH (53%) in sporadic pheochromocytomas argue for genes
other than VHL, especially on 1p, that are significant for sporadic
tumorigenesis and suggest that the genetic pathways involved in sporadic
versus VHL pheochromocytoma genesis are distinct.

Renal cell carcinomas occur frequently in patients treated with
long-term dialysis, especially in cases of end-stage renal disease
(ESRD)/acquired cystic disease of the kidney (ACDK). In patients
receiving dialysis, Yoshida et al. (2002) examined 14 RCCs (7 clear-cell
and 7 papillary carcinomas) for somatic mutations of the VHL gene as
well as of the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET oncogene (164860) to
address the molecular pathogenesis of ESRD/ACDK-associated RCCs. They
found that 3 tumors had VHL frameshifts; 1 showed additional LOH at the
VHL gene locus. All 3 tumors were clear-cell RCCs occurring in ESRD with
55, 106, and 156 months of dialysis, respectively. No mutations were
found in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET oncogene, where mutations
had previously been found in cases of papillary RCCs.

Maranchie et al. (2004) observed a paradoxically lower prevalence of RCC
in patients with complete germline deletion of VHL. They retrospectively
evaluated 123 patients from 55 families with large germline VHL
deletions, including 42 intragenic partial deletions and 13 complete VHL
deletions. An age-adjusted comparison demonstrated a higher prevalence
of RCC in patients with partial germline VHL deletions relative to
complete deletions (48.9% vs 22.6%, p = 0.007). This striking phenotypic
dichotomy was not seen for cystic renal lesions or for CNS (p = 0.22),
pancreas (p = 0.72), or pheochromocytoma (p = 0.34). Deletion mapping
demonstrated that development of RCC had an even greater correlation
with retention of HSPC300 (C3ORF10; 611183), located within the 30-kb
region of 3p, immediately telomeric to VHL (52.3% vs 18.9%, p less than
0.001), suggesting the presence of a neighboring gene or genes critical
to the development and maintenance of RCC.

Gallou et al. (2004) studied the renal phenotype in 274 individuals from
126 unrelated VHL families in whom 92 different VHL mutations were
identified. The incidence of renal involvement was increased in families
with mutations leading to protein truncation or large rearrangement, as
compared to families with missense mutations (81% vs 63%, respectively;
p = 0.03). In the group with missense mutations, Gallou et al. (2004)
identified 2 mutation cluster regions (MCRs) associated with a high risk
of harboring renal lesions: MCR-1 (codons 74-90) and MCR-2 (codons
130-136). In addition, the incidence of RCCs was higher in families with
mutations leading to protein truncation than in families with missense
mutations (75% vs 57%, respectively; p = 0.04). Furthermore, missense
mutations within MCR-1, but not MCR-2, conferred genetic susceptibility
to RCC.

- Autosomal Recessive Familial Erythrocytosis 2

Inheritance of germline mutations in both VHL alleles was found by Ang
et al. (2002) and by others (Pastore et al., 2003; Percy et al., 2002)
as the cause of autosomal recessive familial erythrocytosis (ECYT2,
263400; see 608537.0019). The VHL protein plays an important role in
hypoxia sensing. It binds to hydroxylated HIF1-alpha and serves as a
recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In hypoxia or
secondary to a mutated VHL gene, the nondegraded HIF1-alpha forms a
heterodimer with HIF1-beta and leads to increased transcription of
hypoxia-inducible genes, including EPO. Pastore et al. (2003) reported 7
erythrocytosis patients with VHL mutations in both alleles
(608537.0021-608537.0024). Two Danish sibs and an American boy were
homozygous for the R200W mutation (608537.0019). Three unrelated white
Americans were compound heterozygous for R200W and another VHL mutation:
L188V (608537.0014) in 2 and P192A (608537.0023) in the third.
Additionally, a Croatian boy was homozygous for an H191D mutation
(608537.0024). Pastore et al. (2003) stated that they had not observed
VHL syndrome-associated tumors in subjects with erythrocytosis or their
heterozygous relatives. They found that up to half of the consecutive
patients with apparent congenital erythrocytosis and increased serum EPO
(133170) whom they had examined had mutations of both VHL alleles. They
concluded that VHL mutations are the most frequent cause of recessive
congenital erythrocytosis and define a class of disorders due to
augmented hypoxia sensing.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gemmill et al. (2002) isolated the Drosophila homolog of TRC8 (603046)
and studied its function by genetic manipulations and a yeast 2-hybrid
screen. Human and Drosophila TRC8 proteins localize to the endoplasmic
reticulum. Loss of either Drosophila Trc8 or Vhl resulted in an
identical ventral midline defect. Direct interaction between Trc8 and
Vhl in Drosophila was confirmed by GST-pull-down and
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Gemmill et al. (2002) found that in
Drosophila, overexpression of Trc8 inhibited growth consistent with its
presumed role as a tumor suppressor gene. Human JAB1 (604850)
localization was dependent on VHL mutant status. Thus, the VHL, TRC8,
and JAB1 proteins appear to be linked both physically and functionally,
and all 3 may participate in the development of kidney cancer.

Ding et al. (2006) used the Cre-loxP system to delete the Vhl gene from
podocytes in the glomerular basement membrane of mice. At about 4 weeks
of age, the mice developed rapidly progressive renal disease with
hematuria, proteinuria, and renal failure with crescentic
glomerulonephritis with prominent segmental fibrin deposition and
fibrinoid necrosis. No immune deposits were present; the phenotype was
similar to human 'pauci-immune' rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
(RPGN). Gene expression profiling showed increased expression of the HIF
target gene Cxcr4 (162643) in glomeruli from both mice and humans with
RPGN. Treatment of the mice with a Cxcr4 antibody resulted in clinical
improvement, and isolated overexpression of Cxcr4 was sufficient to
cause glomerular disease. Ding et al. (2006) hypothesized that
upregulation of Cxcr4 allowed terminally differentiated podocytes to
reenter the cell cycle, proliferate, and form cellular crescents.

Hickey et al. (2007) found that mice homozygous for the Chuvash
polycythemia-associated VHL mutation (R200W; 608537.0019) developed
polycythemia similar to the human disease. Although bone marrow
cellularity and morphology was similar to controls, spleens from the
mutant mice showed increased numbers of erythroid progenitors and
megakaryocytes, as well as erythroid differentiation of splenic cells in
vitro. Further analysis showed upregulation of HIF2A (603349) and of key
target genes, including EPO, VEGF (192240), GLUT1 (138140), and PAI1
(173360), that contribute to polycythemia.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Zehetner et al. (2008) found that
Vhl was expressed in mouse insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells.
Conditional inactivation of Vhl in beta cells promoted a diversion of
glucose away from mitochondria into lactate production, causing cells to
produce high levels of glycolytically derived ATP and to secrete
elevated levels of insulin at low glucose concentrations. Vhl-deficient
mice exhibited diminished glucose-stimulated changes in cytoplasmic
Ca(2+) concentration, electrical activity, and insulin secretion, which
culminated in impaired systemic glucose tolerance. Vhl deletion was
associated with upregulation of Hif1a and the glucose transporter Glut1,
an Hif1a target gene. Combined deletion of Vhl and Hif1a rescued the
defects due to Vhl deletion alone, implying that they resulted from
Hif1a activation.

Lee et al. (2009) generated transgenic mouse embryonic stem cells with
the homozygous VHL type 2B mutation R167Q (608537.0005). Mutant cells
had preserved regulation of both HIF-alpha factors with slightly greater
normotoxic dysregulation of HIF2-alpha. R167Q-derived teratomas had a
growth advantage and showed hemangioma formation. Homozygous mice were
embryonic lethal due to placental failure, and heterozygous mice
developed renal cysts and were predisposed to the carcinogen-promoted
renal carcinoma.

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),

In a patient with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), Latif et al.

In a cell line from a sporadic case of renal cell carcinoma (144700),
Latif et al. (1993) identified a 761C-A transversion in the VHL gene,

VHL, ARG167TRP

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),
the ARG238TRP mutation has been renumbered as ARG167TRP (R167W).

In a study of 94 VHL (193300) patients without large deletions, Crossey
et al. (1994) found that the 2 most frequent mutations were missense
mutations at codon 238: 4 kindreds had a 712C-T transition, resulting in
an arg238-to-trp (R238W) change, and 5 kindreds had a 713G-A transition,
leading to an arg238-to-gln (R238Q; 608537.0005) substitution. Another
mutation 712C-G transversion, resulting in an arg238-to-gly (R238G)
substitution (608537.0004). All 3 mutations at codon 238 occurred at a
CpG dinucleotide. The authors noted that although pheochromocytoma
occurs in only about 7% of patients with VHL, a codon 238 mutation
carried a high risk (62%) of pheochromocytoma.

The R238W mutation was found by Garcia et al. (1997) in a Spanish family
in which VHL was manifested predominantly as familial pheochromocytoma
in 2 generations, consistent with VHL syndrome type 2C.

In a mother and 2 sons with pheochromocytoma (171300), consistent with
VHL syndrome type 2C, Crossey et al. (1995) identified the R238W
mutation.

Zbar et al. (1996) confirmed previous observations that germline codon
167 mutations of the VHL gene (R167W and R167Q; 608537.0005) convey a
high risk for the development of pheochromocytoma and renal cell
carcinoma. In 21 of 33 families with mutations at codon 167,
pheochromocytoma occurred, compared to 15 of 223 families without a
mutation at codon 167. The association between codon 167 mutations and
pheochromocytoma was detected in all nationalities tested. Two of 4
Japanese VHL pheochromocytoma families had mutations at codon 167; and 3
of 10 French VHL pheochromocytoma families had mutations at codon 167.

Neumann et al. (2002) identified the R167Q substitution in the germline
of a patient with sporadic pheochromocytoma (171300).

In the germlines of 6 unrelated patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma
(171300), Neumann et al. (2002) identified the R167W substitution. The
mutation was not identified in 600 control chromosomes.

In a patient with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), Loeb et al.
(1994) identified a 694C-T transition in exon 3 of the VHL gene,
resulting in an amber stop codon arg232-to-ter (R232X).

Gilcrease et al. (1995) found the identical 694C-T transition as a
somatic mutation in a clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis
in a patient who showed no evidence of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and in
whom somatic cells did not contain this mutation.

VHL, TRP88SER

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),
the TRP159SER mutation has been renumbered as TRP88SER (W88S).

In 13 sporadic cases of cerebellar hemangioblastoma, Kanno et al. (1994)
sought somatic mutations in the VHL gene with single-strand conformation
polymorphism analyses of the tumor DNAs. An abnormal SSCP pattern was
detected in 7, and in 3 of these the mutation was successfully
characterized by direct sequencing. The somatic mutations were 2
missense mutations and 1 deletion of a single base. One of the missense
mutations was a 476G-C transversion, resulting in a trp-to-ser change.
The codon number was not noted.

In a Japanese patient with VHL (193300), the Clinical Research Group for
VHL in Japan (1995) identified the 476G-C transversion, which resulted
in a trp159-to-ser (W159S) substitution.

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),
the TYR169HIS mutation has been renumbered as TYR98HIS (Y98H), resulting
from a 292T-C transition.

In 14 apparently unrelated von Hippel-Lindau syndrome type 2A (193300)
families from the Black Forest region of Germany, Brauch et al. (1995)
found a 505T-C transition in the VHL gene, resulting in a tyr169-to-his
(Y169H) substitution. Brauch et al. (1995) suggested that more than 75
VHL germline mutations had been identified in VHL patients to that date.
The same mutation, associated with pheochromocytoma, had been identified
by Chen et al. (1995) in 2 VHL 2A families in Pennsylvania. All affected
individuals in the 16 families shared the same VHL haplotype, indicating
a founder effect. In at least one of the Pennsylvania families, the
Y169H mutation probably derived from their Pfalz ancestors, who were
among Germans who migrated to Pennsylvania.

In a patient with the Y169H mutation as the cause of VHL, Schimke et al.
(1998) found a functioning carotid paraganglioma.

Allen et al. (2001) performed a longitudinal clinical study and DNA
analysis of 24 family members, 16 of whom exhibited a 505T-C change in
exon 1 of the VHL gene. Two of the 16 were asymptomatic carriers of the
505T-C mutation. Twelve of 16 (75%) of the gene carriers had 1 or more
ocular angiomas. The mean number of ocular angiomas per gene carrier was
3.3. Six eyes had optic disc angiomas. Five gene carriers (31%) lost
vision because of ocular angiomatosis. Four patients (25%) had
cerebellar hemangioblastomas and 11 patients (69%) had
pheochromocytomas. No patient had renal cell carcinoma, consistent with
the clinical diagnosis of VHL syndrome type 2A. The authors stated that
recognition of the VHL syndrome 2A phenotype suggested the presence of a
specific mutation (505T-C) in the VHL gene. They suggested that
confirmation of this genotype would increase a clinician's ability to
provide favorable prognostic information to affected family members.

Bender et al. (2001) studied 125 individuals in southern Germany
carrying the 505T-C mutation. Forty-seven percent had pheochromocytoma;
36% had retinal angioma; 36%, hemangioblastoma of the spine; and 16% had
hemangioblastoma of the brain. Forty-seven percent of patients were
symptomatic; 30% were asymptomatic despite the presence of at least 1
VHL-related tumor; and 23% of the carriers had no detectable VHL lesion.
Of the 19 patients who died, 10 died of symptomatic VHL lesions. Overall
penetrance by cumulative incidence was estimated at 48% by 35 years and
88% by 70 years. Bender et al. (2001) suggested that the mortality rate
for those carrying this mutation was much lower than in unselected VHL
mutations and was comparable to that of the general population of
Germany.

VHL, TYR112HIS

In a large VHL (193300) family with pheochromocytoma without renal
carcinoma (VHL type 2A) studied by Tisherman et al. (1962, 1993), Zbar
et al. (1996) identified a tyr112-to-his (Y112H) mutation in the VHL
gene. Of 22 affected family members, 19 were affected with
pheochromocytoma; no affected family member had renal cell carcinoma. In
the original report (Tisherman et al., 1962), at least 7 persons had
pheochromocytoma. One or more cafe-au-lait spots (in 22 persons),
extensive hemangiomas (in 2 persons), and angiomatosis retinae (in 2
persons) were discovered in the family.

VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, VAL166PHE

In a family with VHL (193300), Gross et al. (1996) identified a
val166-to-phe (V166F) mutation in the VHL gene. Seven members had
pheochromocytoma, all without renal carcinoma.

VHL, LEU188VAL

In a family with VHL (193300), Neumann et al. (1995) identified a
leu188-to-val (L188V) mutation in the VHL gene. Nine patients had
pheochromocytoma without renal carcinoma (Zbar et al., 1996).

In 6 members of the same German family identified by Neumann et al.
(1995) with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome type 2C, Weirich et al. (2002)
found a P81S mutation in the VHL gene (608537.0020) which cosegregated
with the L188V mutation. Weirich et al. (2002) discussed the possible
impact of these mutations on protein function and phenotype.

In 2 unrelated white American children, a 15-year-old male and a
13-year-old female, who presented at 5 years of age with familial
erythrocytosis (ECYT2; 263400), Pastore et al. (2003) identified a
562C-G transversion in the VHL gene, resulting in the L188V mutation. In
both patients the mutation was in compound heterozygous state with the
common R200W mutation (608537.0019).

Neumann et al. (2002) identified the L188V mutation in the germline of a
patient with sporadic pheochromocytoma (171300). The mutation was not
identified in 600 control chromosomes.

.0015
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
VHL, ARG64PRO

In an uncle and his nephew with apparently isolated pheochromocytoma
(171300), van der Harst et al. (1998) found an arg64-to-pro (R64P)
mutation in the VHL gene. This mutation was 1 of 3 missense mutations
identified by van der Harst et al. (1998) that were located closer to
the N terminus of the VHL protein than any previously reported VHL
mutation (see also 608537.0016).

.0016
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
VHL, LEU63PRO

In a patient with apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma (171300), van der
Harst et al. (1998) found a leu63-to-pro (L63P) mutation in the VHL
gene. This mutation was 1 of 3 missense mutations identified by van der
Harst et al. (1998) that were located closer to the N terminus of the
VHL protein than any previously reported VHL mutation (see also
608537.0015).

.0017
VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, TYR112ASN

In a family with VHL (193300), Bradley et al. (1999) identified a 547T-A
transversion in exon 1 of the VHL gene, resulting in a tyr112-to-asn
(Y112N) substitution. Of 13 affected individuals, 7 had renal cell
carcinoma and 1 had pheochromocytoma. The authors contrasted this family
to 2 families reported by Chen et al. (1996) that had a mutation at the
same position but causing a different amino acid change (tyr112 to his;
608537.0012). In these families, 19 of 22 affected individuals had
pheochromocytoma and none had renal cell carcinoma. Bradley et al.
(1999) concluded that different amino acid changes at the same position
can cause very distinct clinical phenotypes.

.0018
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA WITH PARANEOPLASTIC ERYTHROCYTOSIS
VHL, LEU163PRO

Wiesener et al. (2002) described a 50-year-old man, admitted to hospital
for acute myocardial infarction, who was found to have marked
erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) was increased, and
ultrasonography demonstrated a mass at the upper pole of the left
kidney. Following nephrectomy, which confirmed the diagnosis of renal
cell carcinoma (144700), EPO serum concentration decreased within 7 days
and hemoglobin levels returned to normal. The patient was well 9 months
later with normal EPO serum concentration. In this patient, Wiesener et
al. (2002) reported that EPO mRNA was not detectable in normal kidney
tissue but markedly upregulated in the tumor. Hypoxia-inducible genes,
including VEGF (192240), GLUT1 (138140), carbonic anhydrase-9 (603179),
lactate dehydrogenase-A (150000), and aldolase A (103850), were also
strongly induced in the tumor. Immunoblots showed significant
overexpression of the HIF1A (603348) and HIF2A (603349) subunits in the
tumor, and immunohistochemistry performed for HIF1A showed nuclear
accumulation of the transcription factor in virtually every tumor cell.
A mutation analysis of the VHL gene in tumor cells revealed a
leu163-to-pro (L163P) missense mutation due to a 701T-C transition in
exon 3. This mutation had previously been identified in another RCC. The
mutation was not present in other tissues of the patient. In this case,
there was a clear indication that the pronounced erythrocytosis was a
precipitating factor in the coronary thrombosis.

.0019
POLYCYTHEMIA, CHUVASH TYPE
VHL, ARG200TRP

Chuvash polycythemia, familial erythrocytosis-2 (263400) caused by this
specific mutation, is an autosomal recessive disorder of erythrocytosis
that is endemic to the mid-Volga River region. Ang et al. (2002) studied
5 multiplex Chuvash families and confirmed that polycythemia was
associated with significant elevations of serum erythropoietin (EPO;
133170) levels and ruled out a location of the gene on chromosome 11 as
had been reported previously by Vasserman et al. (1999). They also ruled
out mutation in the HIF1A gene (603348), which is located in 14q. Using
a genomewide screen, they identified a region on 3p with a lod score
greater than 2 and identified a 598C-T transition in the VHL gene,
resulting in an arg200-to-trp (R200W) mutation in all cases. Ang et al.
(2002) concluded that the R200W substitution impairs the interaction of
VHL with HIF1-alpha, reducing the rate of degradation of HIF1-alpha and
resulting in increased expression of downstream target genes including
EPO, SLC2A1 (138140), transferrin (TF; 190000), transferrin receptor
(TFRC; 190010), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240).
Mutations in VHL had been associated with pheochromocytoma,
hemangioblastoma, and renal cell carcinoma, none of which were observed
in individuals with Chuvash polycythemia or obligate carriers of the
R200W mutation. Ang et al. (2002) stated that more than 700 mutations
had been reported in VHL (Beroud et al., 1998), but that no individual
had been found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for germline
mutations.

Pastore et al. (2003) evaluated the role of the VHL gene in 8 children
with a history of polycythemia and an elevated serum EPO level and
identified 3 different germline VHL mutations in 4 of them. One child
was homozygous for the R200W mutation, and another was compound
heterozygous for the R200W mutation and a val130-to-leu mutation (V130L;
608537.0021). Of 2 sibs who were heterozygous for an asp126-to-tyr
mutation (D126Y; 608537.0022), 1 fulfilled some criteria of VHL syndrome
(193300); a pulmonary angioma was discovered at 10 years of age and
treated by coil embolization without effect on the polycythemia, and at
15 years of age nephrectomy was performed for a subcapsular hemangioma.

Percy et al. (2002) observed homozygosity for the R200W mutation in 3
Bangladeshi families with Chuvash-type congenital polycythemia living in
the United Kingdom.

By haplotype analysis of 101 ethnically diverse individuals with the
common R200W mutation, including 72 Chuvash individuals, Liu et al.
(2004) determined that the R200W mutation is due to a founder effect
that originated from 14,000 to 62,000 years ago.

In a matched cohort study, Gordeuk et al. (2004) found that homozygosity
for the 598C-T transition in the VHL gene was associated with vertebral
hemangiomas, varicose veins, lower blood pressures, and elevated serum
VEGF concentrations (p less than 0.0005), as well as premature mortality
related to cerebral vascular events and peripheral thrombosis.
Spinocerebellar hemangioblastomas, renal carcinomas, and
pheochromocytomas typical of classic VHL syndrome were not found,
suggesting that overexpression of HIF1-alpha and VEGF is not sufficient
for tumorigenesis. Although hemoglobin-adjusted serum erythropoietin
concentrations were approximately 10-fold higher in 598C-T homozygotes
than in controls, erythropoietin response to hypoxia was identical.
Gordeuk et al. (2004) concluded that Chuvash polycythemia is a distinct
VHL syndrome manifested by thrombosis, vascular abnormalities, and
intact hypoxic regulation despite increased basal expression of
hypoxia-regulated genes.

Cario et al. (2005) reported a Turkish patient who was homozygous for
the R200W mutation. Haplotype analysis showed a different haplotype than
that associated with the Chuvash population, indicating that the
mutation arose independently and is not geographically restricted.

Perrotta et al. (2006) found that the R200W missense mutation (598C-T)
causing Chuvash polycythemia is more frequent on the island of Ischia in
the Bay of Naples (0.070) than it is in Chuvashia (0.057). The haplotype
of all patients in Ischia matched that identified in the Chuvash
cluster, thus supporting the single founder hypothesis. Perrotta et al.
(2006) also found that unaffected heterozygotes had increased HIF1-alpha
activity, which might confer a biochemical advantage for mutation
maintenance. They suggested that this form of familial polycythemia may
be endemic in other regions of the world, a hypothesis supported by the
reports of Percy et al. (2002, 2003).

Russell et al. (2011) presented evidence suggesting 2 main molecular
mechanisms by which the R200W and H191D (608537.0024) VHL mutations
result in polycythemia. In vitro studies showed that the R200W mutation
attenuated formation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase and attenuated binding
of HIF1 (603348). In patients, this would lead to overproduction of the
HIF-target erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) and thus secondary polycythemia.
In addition, VHL mutations result in conformational changes causing
increased binding to SOCS1 (603597), which inhibits binding and
degradation of phosphorylated JAK2 (147796). The resulting pJAK2
stabilization promotes hyperactivation of the JAK2-STAT5 (601511)
pathway in erythroid progenitors, causing hypersensitivity to
erythropoietin and thereby to primary polycythemia. Treatment of
R200W/R200W transgenic mice with a JAK2 inhibitor resulted in decreased
hematocrit, smaller spleen, and decreased sensitivity to EPO compared to
untreated transgenic mice.

VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, PRO81SER

In 6 members of a German family in which the L188V mutation in the VHL
gene (608537.0014) had previously been identified in association with
von Hippel-Lindau syndrome type 2C (193300), Weirich et al. (2002)
identified a 454C-T transition in exon 1 of the VHL gene, resulting in a
pro81-to-ser (P81S) mutation. The concurrent P81S mutation was
identified by novel screening approaches, including denaturing
high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing. The 2
mutations cosegregated with the syndrome. Weirich et al. (2002)
discussed the possible impact of the mutations on protein function and
phenotype.

In a 10-year-old white American boy who presented at age 9 years with

compound heterozygosity for a 574C-T transition in the VHL gene,
resulting in a pro192-to-ser (P192S) change, and the common R200W
mutation (608537.0019).

VHL, HIS191ASP

In a 17-year-old Croatian boy who presented at age 1 year with familial
erythrocytosis (263400), Pastore et al. (2003) identified homozygosity
for a 571C-G transversion in the VHL gene, resulting in a his191-to-asp
(H191D) change.

Russell et al. (2011) presented evidence suggesting 2 main molecular
mechanisms by which the H191D and R200W (608537.0019) VHL mutations
result in polycythemia. In vitro studies showed that the H191D mutation
attenuated formation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase and attenuated binding
of HIF1 (603348). In patients, this would lead to overproduction of the
HIF-target erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) and thus secondary polycythemia.
In addition, VHL mutations result in conformational changes causing
increased binding to SOCS1 (603597), which inhibits binding and

VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, VAL84LEU

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),
the VAL155LEU (V155L) mutation has been renumbered as V84L.

In 2 sibs from Wales with bilateral pheochromocytoma without other
features of VHL syndrome, consistent with VHL type 2C (193300), Crossey
et al. (1995) identified a heterozygous 463G-T transversion in exon 1 of
the VHL gene, resulting in a val155-to-leu (V155L) substitution.

Abbott et al. (2006) identified the V84L substitution in affected
individuals from 3 unrelated families with early-onset isolated
pheochromocytoma consistent with VHL syndrome type 2C. Although no other
signs of VHL syndrome were present in 7 patients, 1 patient was
suspected to have a spinal hemangioblastoma based on imaging studies.

.0026
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
VHL, GLY93SER

In the germlines of 2 unrelated patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma
(171300), Neumann et al. (2002) identified a 490G-A transition in exon 1
of the VHL gene, resulting in a gly93-to-ser (G93S) substitution. The
mutation was not identified in 600 control chromosomes.

.0027
VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, GLN164ARG

In a 2.5-year-old girl who presented with a pheochromocytoma but no
other manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), Sovinz et
al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 491A-G transition in exon 3 of the
VHL gene, resulting in an gln164-to-arg (Q164R) substitution in a
protein surface residue. Genotyping of the family indicated that she
inherited the mutation from her father, in whom it occurred de novo.
Although he was in good health and asymptomatic, detailed physical
examination found a retinal angioma, an adrenal adenoma, and bilateral
pheochromocytoma, consistent with VHL syndrome. Sovinz et al. (2010)
noted that Ong et al. (2007) had identified the Q164R mutation in a
family in which a patient developed pheochromocytoma at age 10 years and
retinal angioma at age 23 years, suggesting that this mutation may be
associated with early onset of symptoms.

603012	TITLE *603012 HEAT-SHOCK 70-KD PROTEIN 1B; HSPA1B
;;HEAT-SHOCK PROTEIN, 70-KD, 1B;;
HSP70-1B;;
HEAT-SHOCK PROTEIN, 70-KD, 2;;
HSP70-2
DESCRIPTION Heat-shock proteins, or stress proteins, are expressed in response to
heat shock and a variety of other stress stimuli including oxidative
free radicals and toxic metal ions. The human HSP70, or HSPA, multigene
family encodes several highly conserved 70-kD proteins with structural
and functional properties in common, but which vary in their
inducibility in response to metabolic stress. Sargent et al. (1989)
identified a duplicated HSP70 locus in the class III region of the major
histocompatibility complex on 6p21.3. These loci, HSP70-1 (HSPA1A;
140550) and HSP70-2 (HSPA1B), are 12 kb apart and lie 92 kb telomeric to
the C2 gene (613927). Milner and Campbell (1990) determined that the
HSP70-2 gene, like HSP70-1, lacks introns. The HSP70-1 and -2 coding
sequences, which differ by 8 bp that do not alter the derived amino acid
sequence, encode identical 641-amino acid proteins; the 3-prime
untranslated regions of these genes are completely divergent. Northern
blot analysis of HeLa cell RNA detected an approximately 2.4-kb HSP70-2
transcript that was expressed at elevated levels following heat shock.

Milner and Campbell (1992) investigated the presence of sequence
variation in the HSP70-2 gene among different HLA haplotypes. They found
only very limited sequence variation, which did not result in amino acid
substitutions.

601906	TITLE *601906 WINGLESS-TYPE MMTV INTEGRATION SITE FAMILY, MEMBER 10B; WNT10B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Several members of the Wnt gene family have been shown to cause mammary
tumors in mice. Using degenerate primer PCR on human genomic DNA and
specific PCR of cDNA libraries, Bui et al. (1997) isolated a Wnt gene
that had not previously been described in human. It is the human homolog
of mouse Wnt10b, which had been shown to be one of the oncogenes
cooperating with FGF3 (164950) in the development of mouse mammary tumor
virus (MMTV)-induced mammary carcinomas in mice. The human WNT10B
sequence is 88% and 95% identical to the mouse gene at nucleotide and
amino acid levels, respectively. WNT10B expression was not observed in
normal and benign proliferations of human breast tissue but was found to
be elevated in 3 of 50 primary breast carcinomas. Southern blot analysis
of the carcinoma expressing the highest level of WNT10B showed no
amplification or rearrangement of the gene.

Hardiman et al. (1997) demonstrated that the WNT10B gene encodes a
389-amino acid protein with 96.6% sequence identity to mouse Wnt10b. The
expression pattern showed that it is synthesized in many adult tissues
with the highest levels found in heart and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

By analyzing human genome draft sequence, Kirikoshi et al. (2001)
determined that WNT10B is encoded by 5 exons and is clustered with WNT1
(164820) in a head-to-head manner with an interval of less than 7 kb.
They hypothesized that the WNT1-WNT10B gene cluster and the WNT6
(604663)-WNT10A (606268) gene cluster on chromosome 2 might be due to
duplication of an ancestral WNT gene cluster.

MAPPING

By YAC and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping, Bui et al.
(1997) localized the WNT10B gene to 12q13, a chromosomal region
frequently rearranged in human tumors and also containing the WNT1 gene
(164820).

By PCR typing of a human/rodent monochromosomal panel and FISH, Hardiman
et al. (1997) mapped the WNT10B gene to chromosome 12q13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Ross et al. (2000) showed that WNT signaling, likely mediated by WNT10B,
is a molecular switch that governs adipogenesis. WNT signaling maintains
preadipocytes in an undifferentiated state through inhibition of the
adipogenic transcription factors CEBPA (116897) and PPAR-gamma (601487).
When WNT signaling in preadipocytes is prevented by overexpression of
axin (603816) or dominant-negative TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228), these cells
differentiate into adipocytes. Disruption of WNT signaling also causes
transdifferentiation of myoblasts into adipocytes in vitro, highlighting
the importance of this pathway not only in adipocyte differentiation but
also in mesodermal cell fate determination.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a consanguineous Turkish family with SHFM mapping to chromosome
12q31.11-q13, originally reported by Gul and Oktenli (2002), Ugur and
Tolun (2008) analyzed the candidate gene WNT10B and identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation (R332W; 601906.0001) in all but the
most mildly affected individual; it was also found in homozygosity in 1
unaffected family member. Ugur and Tolun (2008) proposed that either a
second locus contributed to the phenotype or a suppressor locus
prevented trait manifestation in the nonpenetrant female. Linkage
analysis for the 5 known SHFM loci (see SHFM1, 183600) excluded 4 of
them; however, a rare insertion polymorphism (dbSNP rs34201045) at an
alternate promoter used for transcription of an N-terminal-truncated p63
isotype (see TP63, 603273) was detected in heterozygosity or
homozygosity in all but 1 affected individual.

In a 30-year-old pregnant Swiss woman with SHFM6, who presented for
genetic counseling, Blattner et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
truncating mutation in the WNT10B gene (601906.0001). Blattner et al.
(2010) emphasized that this patient, who presented with apparent
sporadic occurrence of the disorder and could have been presumed to have
a de novo dominant mutation, was found to be homozygous for the WNT10B
mutation, resulting in serious implications for genetic counseling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPLIT-HAND/FOOT MALFORMATION 6
WNT10B, ARG332TRP

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with
split-hand/foot malformation-6 (SHFM6; 225300), originally reported by
Gul and Oktenli (2002), Ugur and Tolun (2008) identified homozygosity
for a 994C-T transition in exon 5 of the WNT10B gene, resulting in an
arg332-to-trp (R332W) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation, which was not detected in 200 controls, was not found in the
most mildly affected individual, a man with only cutaneous syndactyly of
the right hand; however, it was present in homozygosity in 1 unaffected
female family member. All but 1 affected individual also carried a TP63
(603273) promoter polymorphism, dbSNP rs34201045, in homozygosity or
heterozygosity.

.0002
SPLIT-HAND/FOOT MALFORMATION 6
WNT10B, 4-BP DUP, 458AGCA

In a 30-year-old pregnant Swiss woman with split-hand/foot
malformation-6 (SHFM6; 225300) who presented for genetic counseling,
Blattner et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 4-bp duplication
(458dupAGCA) in exon 4 of the WNT10B gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature truncation. Both unaffected parents and several other
unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation.
Consanguinity of the parents of the patient was not known. At 12 years
of age, based on radiographs, the malformation was described as
presenting with loss of second, third, and fourth toes of both feet,
bifid fifth toe on the right foot and fusion of the third and fourth
metatarsal of both feet. A surgical osteotomy of the fourth and fifth
metatarsal on the right foot was performed at 5 years. The right hand
impressed at birth with complete cutaneous syndactyly of the fourth and
fifth finger, hypoplasia of the third finger with loss of the distal
phalanx. The left hand showed proximal cutaneous syndactyly of the third
and fourth finger. Blattner et al. (2010) emphasized that this patient,
who presented with apparent sporadic occurrence of the disorder and
could have been presumed to have a de novo dominant mutation, was found
to be homozygous for the WNT10B mutation, resulting in serious
implications for genetic counseling.

605876	TITLE *605876 Fc RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN 4; FCRL4
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY RECEPTOR TRANSLOCATION-ASSOCIATED GENE
1; IRTA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosomal abnormalities involving translocation breakpoints at
1q21-q23 are frequent in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see BCL9; 602597)
and multiple myeloma (MM; see 254500). By cloning the breakpoints of a
(1;14)(q21;q32) chromosomal translocation in the FR4 multiple myeloma
cell line, followed by exon trapping and screening a spleen cDNA
library, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs encoding 3 isoforms
of IRTA1 and 4 isoforms of IRTA2 (605877). The differences in the
IRTA1A, IRTA1B, and IRTA1C isoforms arise from alternate usage of 3
potential polyadenylation sites in the 3-prime untranslated region;
however, the isoforms are identical at the amino acid level. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 515-amino acid IRTA1 protein contains a
signal peptide; 4 extracellular Ig-type domains with 3 potential
N-linked glycosylation sites; a 16-amino acid transmembrane region; and
a 106-amino acid cytoplasmic domain with 3 putative consensus
SH2-binding domains. The SH2-binding domains exhibit features of both
ITIMs (immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs) and ITAMs
(immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) and have the
potential to give rise to either 3 ITIMs or 1 ITAM and 1 ITIM. Northern
blot analysis detected very low levels of 3.5-, 2.7-, and 2.5-kb
transcripts in spleen and lymph node, with no expression in other
tissues or lymphocyte cell lines tested. Expression of IRTA1 could be
induced in an estrogen-deprived, Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized cell
line. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis showed that
IRTA1 expression is concentrated in the perifollicular area of tonsil
tissue, a site rich in memory B cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001) determined
that the IRTA1 and IRTA2 genes are separated by 21 kb and are
transcribed in the same orientation. Furthermore, the IRTA1 and IRTA2
genes form a contig on 1q21 with additional IRTA-related genes (IRTA3,
IRTA4, and IRTA5) and are telomeric to the MUC1 gene (158340) and
centromeric to the FCGR2B gene (604590).

CYTOGENETICS

By Northern blot, RT-PCR, sequence, and Western blot analyses,
Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001) demonstrated that the signal peptide and
first 2 extracellular residues of IRTA1 are fused to the extracellular
spacer, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail of the membrane IgA1
receptor (IGHA1; 146900) in the FR4 multiple myeloma cell line, but not
in other MM or lymphoma cell lines. They concluded that the IRTA1-IGHA1
fusion may be a rare event in B-cell malignancy.

114210	TITLE *114210 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A4; S100A4
;;CALCIUM PLACENTAL PROTEIN; CAPL;;
FIBROBLAST-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 1; FSP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100 proteins, such as S100A4, are small, acidic calcium-binding
proteins that transduce Ca(2+)-signals via interaction with
intracellular target proteins (Mandinova et al., 1998).

CLONING

Engelkamp et al. (1992) cloned S100A4, which they called CAPL, from a
human heart cDNA library. The deduced 101-amino acid protein has the
domain structure of an S100 protein, with N- and C-terminal hydrophobic
regions and 2 central calcium loops. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 650-bp transcript, with highest expression in
thymus, lung, and heart.

Ambartsumian et al. (1995) described 2 alternative splice variants of
S100A4 that differ in their 5-prime untranslated regions.

Using immunofluorescence analysis and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that S100A1 (176940), S100A2
(176993), S100A4, and S100A6 (114110) localized to distinct
intracellular compartments in cultured human vascular and intestinal
smooth muscle cells. S100A1 and S100A4 were associated predominantly
with the sarcoplasmic reticulum and with actin stress fibers.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) led to
relocalization of S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 from sarcoplasmic reticulum
to vesicle-like structures around the nucleus in human vascular smooth
muscle cells. The localization of stress fiber-associated S100A1 and
S100A4 remained unchanged.

Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2005) found that S100B (176990) and S100A4
bound the C-terminal tetramerization domain of p53 (191170) when the
domain was exposed in lower oligomerization states, disrupting p53
tetramerization. S100B bound to the negative regulatory and nuclear
localization domains of p53, resulting in very tight binding. Because
trafficking of p53 depends on its oligomerization state,
Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2005) proposed that S100B and S100A4 may
regulate subcellular localization of p53 but with different effects on
p53 function in cell cycle control due to their differences in binding
p53.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ambartsumian et al. (1995) showed that the S100A4 gene consists of 4
exons.

MAPPING

Jackson-Grusby et al. (1987) isolated a probe for the mouse placental
protein for which the human equivalent was symbolized CAPL by van
Heyningen et al. (1989). By Southern blot analysis of DNAs from somatic
cell hybrids, van Heyningen et al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) showed
that the CAPL gene in man cosegregates with CAGA (123885), CAGB
(123886), and calcyclin (114110). In the hands of van Heyningen et al.
(1989), Southern blot analysis of DNA from BxD recombinant inbred strain
mice showed a TaqI polymorphism for CAPL probe 18A2 to distinguish the
parental strains. CAPL cosegregated in the BxD mice with a fifth member
of this gene family, the p11 protein (mouse symbol Cal11) which had been
mapped to chromosome 3 by Saris et al. (1987). In the mouse Capl is
within 8 kb of Cacy; thus, by homology, the CAPL gene in man is probably
in region 1q21-q25 where the CACY gene has been mapped.

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC clone from the 1q21 region on which
9 different genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be
localized. The clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction
of a new logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome, with S100A1 (176940) being closest to the telomere and
S100A9 being closest to the centromere. In this revised nomenclature,
CAPL became S100A4.

1,25-@DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D3 24-HYDROXYLASE;;
VITAMIN D 24-HYDROXYLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, the physiologically active form of vitamin D3,
exerts its functions through a receptor (VDR; 601769)-mediated
mechanism. In addition to its fundamental role in calcium metabolism,
1,25-(OH)2D3 acts on a variety of tissues. One of its most important
functions is its differentiating activity. The best-characterized
incidence of this activity is induction of differentiation of
promyelocytes into monocytes/macrophages. 1,25-(OH)2D3 is biologically
inactivated through a series of reactions beginning with
24-hydroxylation. 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces the 24-hydroxylase, whereas
hypocalcemia, through increased parathyroid hormone, suppresses this
enzyme. Chen et al. (1993) isolated the cDNA encoding the human
24-hydroxylase, sequenced it, and demonstrated that it is active when
expressed in genetic expression systems.

Vitamin D 24-hydroxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for
inactivating vitamin D metabolites through the C-24 oxidation pathway.
Ohyama et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA encoding 25-hydroxyvitamin
D(3)24-hydroxylase from a rat kidney cDNA library by use of specific
antibodies to the enzyme. The amino acid sequence showed less than 30%
similarity to those of previously reported cytochrome P450s.

Labuda et al. (1993) cloned part of the CYP24 gene: 776 bp of the coding
and 720 bp of the 3-prime untranslated region interrupted by an intron.
In the coding region, they found 79.8% similarity in DNA and 87.5%
similarity in deduced amino acid sequence between human and rat, with no
similarity in the 3-prime untranslated region.

Independently, Hahn et al. (1993) isolated a human kidney cDNA clone for
vitamin D 24-hydroxylase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen and DeLuca (1995) determined that the promoter region of CYP24
contains a TATA box, a CAAT box, GC boxes, 2 vitamin D-responsive
elements (VDREs), and AP1 (165160)- and AP2 (107580)-binding sites.
Functional characterization of the VDREs indicated that both are
required for optimal induction of CYP24 expression by
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of DNA from human-hamster somatic cell
hybrids and by in situ immunofluorescence hybridization, Labuda et al.
(1993) mapped the CYP24 gene to 20q13.1. Hahn et al. (1993) mapped the
CYP24 gene to 20q13.2-q13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By study of an interspecific backcross, Malas et al. (1994) demonstrated
that the mouse homolog is located on chromosome 2 in a region of
conserved synteny with human chromosome 20.

GENE FUNCTION

Using DNA microarray and quantitative PCR analyses, Liu et al. (2006)
found that activation of TLR2 (603028) and TLR1 (601194) by a
mycobacterial ligand upregulated expression of VDR and CYP27B1 (609506),
the vitamin D 1-hydroxylase that catalyzes the conversion of vitamin D
to its active form, in monocytes and macrophages, but not dendritic
cells. Intracellular flow cytometric and quantitative PCR analyses
showed that treatment of monocytes with vitamin D upregulated expression
of CYP24 and cathelicidin (CAMP; 600474), an antimicrobial peptide, but
not DEFB4 (602215). Confocal microscopy demonstrated colocalization of
CAMP with bacteria-containing vacuoles of vitamin D-treated monocytes,
and vitamin D treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages reduced
the number of viable bacilli. Ligand stimulation of TLR2 and TLR1
upregulated CYP24 and CAMP in the presence of human serum, but not
bovine serum, and CAMP upregulation was more efficient in Caucasian than
in African American serum, in which vitamin D levels were significantly
lower. Vitamin D supplementation of African American serum reversed the
CAMP induction defect. Liu et al. (2006) proposed that vitamin D
supplementation in African and Asian populations, which may have a
reduced ability to synthesize vitamin D from ultraviolet light in
sunlight, might be an effective and inexpensive intervention to enhance
innate immunity against microbial infection and neoplastic disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), Albertson et al.
(2000) resolved 2 regions of amplification within an approximately 2-Mb
region of recurrent aberration at 20q13.2 in breast cancer (114480). The
putative oncogene ZNF217 (602967) mapped to one peak, and CYP24, whose
overexpression is likely to lead to abrogation of growth control
mediated by vitamin D, mapped to the other. Fine mapping demonstrated
that ZNF217 lies proximal to CYP24. As transcription of CYP24 is closely
coupled to the level and activity of VDR, Albertson et al. (2000)
measured both CYP24 and VDR transcript levels using quantitative PCR in
breast tumors. Expression of CYP24, normalized with respect to VDR,
correlated with copy number of CYP24 in the tumors, further supporting
an oncogenic role for CYP24.

In 7 patients from 8 unrelated families with infantile hypercalcemia
(143880), Schlingmann et al. (2011) identified homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the CYP24A1 gene (see, e.g.,
126065.0001-126065.0007). In 1 patient, a heterozygous complex deletion
in CYP24A1 was identified, but no other mutation was detected by
sequence analysis. Overexpression of the mutant CYP24A1 enzymes in a
eukaryotic cell line revealed complete or near-complete loss of function
for all identified mutations.

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that among
the 4 missense mutations reported by Schlingmann et al. (2011), only
L409S (126065.0006) weakens the binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to
24-hydroxylase. Noting that the catabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
by 24-hydroxylase is heme-dependent, Ji and Shen (2011) analyzed the
influence of these mutations on heme binding and found that the other 3
mutations, R159Q (126065.0004), R396W (126065.0005), and E322K
(126065.0007), all change interactions between the heme molecule and
24-hydroxylase.

In a 47-year-old man who had an episode of nephrolithiasis at 19 years
of age and was subsequently asymptomatic until hypercalcemia was
discovered on routine testing at 39 years of age, Streeten et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the CYP24A1 gene
(E143del; 126065.0002). Streeten et al. (2011) noted that this mutation
had been identified by Schlingmann et al. (2011) in patients with
infantile hypercalcemia. Noting that vitamin D prophylaxis was a factor
in the development of symptomatic hypercalcemia in the children reported
by Schlingmann et al. (2011), Schlingmann et al. (2011) suggested that
information on lifestyle, nutrition, and vitamin supplementation in the
patient described by Streeten et al. (2011) might identify a potential
trigger for clinical symptoms in adulthood.

OTHER FEATURES

Ogunkolade et al. (2006) hypothesized that chewing betel nut, an
addictive habit common throughout South Asian communities, contributes
to hypovitaminosis D by modulating the enzymes regulating circulating
activated vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) concentration. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cell 24-hydoxylase (CYP24A1) mRNA correlated
positively and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D negatively with betel quids
per day. Betel chewing is a more powerful independent determinant of
increased 24-hydoxylase expression and of decreased serum calcitriol
than serum 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, supporting the hypothesis that this
habit could aggravate the effects of vitamin D deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kasuga et al. (2002) found that transgenic rats constitutively
expressing CYP24 showed significantly low levels of plasma
24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. They also developed albuminuria and
hyperlipidemia shortly after weaning. Plasma lipid profiles revealed
that all lipoprotein fractions were elevated. Transgenic rats showed
atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta, which progressed with high-fat and
high-cholesterol feeding.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, 2-BP DEL, 1425TC

In an infant girl born of consanguineous Turkish parents, who developed
infantile hypercalcemia (143880) while receiving a 500 IU daily dose of
vitamin D, Schlingmann et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 2-bp
deletion (1425delTC) in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
predicted to cause premature termination of the protein. The mutation
was not found in at least 204 control alleles, and transfection studies
demonstrated complete loss of CYP24A1 catabolic activity with the mutant
compared to wildtype.

.0002
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, 3-BP DEL, 427GAA

In monozygotic twin brothers from a German family, who developed
infantile hypercalcemia (143880) while receiving a 500 IU daily dose of
vitamin D, Schlingmann et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 3-bp deletion (427delGAA) in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in the
in-frame deletion of a glutamic acid residue at codon 143 (E143del), and
a 451G-T transversion, resulting in a gln151-to-ter (E151X; 126065.0003)
substitution. In a Turkish infant who also developed hypercalcemia on
500 IU per day of vitamin D, Schlingmann et al. (2011) identified
compound heterozygosity for the 3-bp deletion and a 476G-A transition in
the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in an arg159-to-gln (R159Q; 126065.0004)
substitution. The mutations were not found in at least 204 control
alleles, and transfection studies demonstrated ablation of CYP24A1
catabolic activity with either the 3-bp deletion or the R159Q mutation
compared to wildtype.

In a 47-year-old man who had an episode of nephrolithiasis at 19 years
of age and was subsequently asymptomatic until hypercalcemia was
discovered on routine testing at 39 years of age (see 143880), Streeten
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the E143del mutation in
CYP24A1. The patient had a suppressed parathyroid hormone level,
elevated levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and
low levels of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. His adult son with
normocalciuria was heterozygous for the E143del mutation.

.0004
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, ARG159GLN

See 126065.0002 and Schlingmann et al. (2011).

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that the
R159Q mutation changes interactions between the heme molecule and
24-hydroxylase, due to destruction of hydrogen bonds between the heme
propionate group and arginine.

.0005
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, ARG396TRP (dbSNP rs114368325)

In a German patient who developed infantile hypercalcemia (143880)
following a 600,000 IU oral dose of vitamin D, Schlingmann et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 1186C-T transition in the CYP24A1 gene,
resulting in an arg396-to-trp (R396W) substitution. In 2 Russian
brothers who developed infantile hypercalcemia while taking 500 IU of
vitamin D per day, the R396W mutation was found in compound
heterozygosity with a 1226T-C transition in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting
in a leu409-to-ser (L409S; 126065.0006) substitution; and in 2 unrelated
patients from Germany who developed hypercalcemia of infancy after 2 and
3 oral boluses of 600,000 IU of vitamin D, respectively, previously
reported by Misselwitz and Hesse (1986), Schlingmann et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygosity for the R396W mutation and a 964G-A
transition in CYP24A1, resulting in a glu322-to-lys (E322K; 126065.0007)
substitution. The E322K mutation was not found in at least 204 control
alleles; the R396W and L409S mutations, which had previously been
annotated as putative polymorphisms in the dbSNP database, were tested
in a sample of 1,024 control alleles, and L409S was not detected, but
R396W was identified in 4 of the control alleles. Transfection studies
demonstrated that R396W and E322K mutations resulted in complete loss of
CYP24A1 catabolic activity, whereas the L409S mutation retained small
but measurable levels of activity.

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that the
R396W mutation changes interactions between the heme molecule and
24-hydroxylase, due to destruction of hydrogen bonds between the heme
propionate group and arginine.

.0006
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, LEU409SER (dbSNP rs6068812)

See 126065.0005 and Schlingmann et al. (2011).

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that the
L409S mutation weakens the binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to
24-hydroxylase.

.0007
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, GLU322LYS

See 126065.0005 and Schlingmann et al. (2011).

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that the
E322K mutation changes interactions between the heme molecule and
24-hydroxylase. Schlingmann et al. (2011) stated that the E322K mutation
abolishes important hydrogen bonding between the I-helix and the
B-prime/C loop backbone, affecting their relative orientation and that
of the B-prime helix and thereby preventing correct protein folding and
stability.

610837	TITLE *610837 BCL2-LIKE 12; BCL2L12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BCL2L12 belongs to the BCL2 family of apoptosis-regulating proteins (see
BCL2; 151430) (Scorilas et al., 2001).

CLONING

Scorilas et al. (2001) identified a BAC clone encoding a BH2 domain,
which is conserved among BCL2 proteins, and by database analysis,
RT-PCR, and 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, they obtained a full-length cDNA
encoding BCL2L12. The deduced 334-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 36.8 kD. It contains several PxxP motifs, a C-terminal
BH2 domain, and multiple sites for O-glycosylation, phosphorylation, and
N-myristoylation. Scorilas et al. (2001) also cloned a BCL2L12 splice
variant lacking exon 3, which encodes a C-terminally truncated 176-amino
acid protein that lacks several PxxP motifs and the BH2 domain. RT-PCR
detected both variants in all adult and fetal tissues examined. The
full-length transcript showed highest expression in thymus, prostate,
fetal liver, mammary gland, colon, placenta, small intestine, kidney,
and bone marrow. The splice variant showed highest expression in
skeletal muscle, fetal liver, and spinal cord. The full-length
transcript was expressed at higher levels than the splice variant in all
tissues examined except skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray analysis, Stegh et al. (2007) found that BCL2L12
expression was upregulated in 53 of 55 human primary glioblastomas
relative to surrounding normal brain tissue. Immunohistochemical
analysis detected BCL2L12 in tumor cell cytoplasm and in endothelial
cells within abnormal tumor vasculature. A modest amount was detected in
normal neurons, but no staining was detected in normal glia. Expression
of human BCL2L12 conferred marked resistance to apoptosis in mouse
primary cortical astrocytes. Conversely, knockdown of BCL2L12 via RNA
interference sensitized human glioma cell lines to apoptotic stimuli and
impaired tumor growth in mouse xenografts via increased intratumoral
apoptosis. BCL2L12 expression did not affect cytochrome c (123970)
release or protect the mitochondrial membrane, but instead inhibited
postmitochondrial apoptotic signaling at the level of effector caspase
activation. BCL2L12 interacted directly with and neutralized caspase-7
(CASP7; 601761), and it neutralized caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) by an
indirect mechanism. While BCL2L12 overexpression inhibited apoptosis, it
also induced a necrotic state following activation of apoptotic
signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Scorilas et al. (2001) determined that the SLC2L12 gene contains 7
coding exons and spans 8.8 kb. The promoter region contains a TATA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Scorilas et al. (2001) mapped the BCL2L12
gene to chromosome 19q13.3, between the RRAS gene (165090) and the PRMT1
gene (602950).

613593	TITLE *613593 BUTYROPHILIN, SUBFAMILY 3, MEMBER A1; BTN3A1
;;BT3.1;;
BTF5;;
CD277
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The butyrophilin (BTN) genes are a group of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC)-associated genes that encode type I membrane proteins with
2 extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and an intracellular B30.2
(PRYSPRY) domain. Three subfamilies of human BTN genes are located in
the MHC class I region: the single-copy BTN1A1 gene (601610) and the
BTN2 (e.g., BTN2A1; 613590) and BTN3 (e.g., BNT3A1) genes, which have
undergone tandem duplication, resulting in 3 copies of each (summary by
Smith et al., 2010).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, RT-PCR of peripheral blood leukocytes and
human cell lines, and 3-prime RACE of a fetal tissue cDNA library,
Rhodes et al. (2001) cloned BTN3A1. They also identified a BTN3A1 splice
variant encoding a truncated protein lacking the B30.2 domain, and this
variant was more abundant than the full-length form.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rhodes et al. (2001) determined that the BTN3A1 gene spans approximately
12 kb and contains 9 coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rhodes et al. (2001) mapped the BTN3A1
gene within the BTN gene cluster on chromosome 6p22.1. The BTN gene
cluster is located about 4 Mb telomeric to the classical MHC class I
genes.

603071	TITLE *603071 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 17; GPR17
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily contain 7
transmembrane domains and transduce extracellular signals through
heterotrimeric G proteins. By PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides
based on regions conserved between IL8RA (146929) and the angiotensin II
chemokine GPCR (106165), Raport et al. (1996) isolated the GPR17 gene,
which they called R12. Independently, Blasius et al. (1998) used RT-PCR
to identify novel P2 nucleotide (P2Y) GPCRs (see 601167) and isolated
GPR17 cDNAs. They identified 2 GPR17 splice variants, designated HIP4
and FB1, which encode predicted proteins of 339 and 367 amino acids,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that human GPR17 is
expressed as 2.3- and 6.3-kb mRNAs exclusively in brain. The 2
transcripts appear to represent alternatively polyadenylated variants.
Based on protein sequence homology and the conservation of certain key
residues, GPR17 appears to be closely related to the P2Y family of
GPCRs. However, Blasius et al. (1998) stated that preliminary functional
data did not support the hypothesis that classical P2Y agonists serve as
ligands for this receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciana et al. (2006) expressed GPR17 in different cell lines and found
that stimulation with both uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes
(CysLTs) resulted in specific and concentration-dependent responses. In
vivo, knockdown of Gpr17 by either CysLT receptor (CYSLTR1; 300201) or
P2Y receptor (e.g., P2RY12; 600515) antagonists or by antisense
technology prevented evolution of brain damage in a rat focal ischemia
model. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of GPR17 in human and rat
organs prone to ischemic damage, including brain, kidney, and heart.
GPR17 appeared to possess 2 distinct binding sites, one for nucleotides
and the other for CysLTs. Ciana et al. (2006) concluded that GPR17 is a
common molecular target that may mediate ischemia and inflammatory
effects induced by nucleotides and CysLTs.

Using mouse cDNAs, Maekawa et al. (2009) showed that Gpr17 downregulated
the function, but not the membrane localization, of the cysteinyl
leukotriene receptor Cyslt1r (CYSLTR1; 300201). Cotransfection of Gpr17
with Cyslt1r suppressed LTD4 binding and inhibited Cyslt1r-mediated Erk
(see MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation in response to LTD4.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that Gpr17 and Cyslt1r interacted
directly. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization
of GPR17 and CYSLT1R on the surface of human peripheral blood monocytes.
Silencing of Gpr17 in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages increased
Cyslt1r membrane expression and increased the magnitude and sensitivity
to LTD4-induced calcium flux. Gpr17 deficiency in mice increased
Cyslt1r-mediated vascular permeability in IgE-dependent mast
cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The vascular leak in
Gpr17-deficient mice was markedly and significantly suppressed by
pharmacologic inhibition of Cyslt1r. Maekawa et al. (2009) concluded
that GPR17 functions as a negative regulator of CYSLT1R.

Mouse hypothalamic neurons expressing Agrp (602311) are involved in
feeding behavior. Ren et al. (2012) found that ablation of Foxo1
(136533) specifically in Agrp-positive hypothalamic neurons resulted in
reduced food intake, leanness, improved glucose homeostasis, and
increased sensitivity to leptin and insulin in mice. Quantitative PCR
and microarray analysis showed that Gpr17 was highly expressed in
Agrp-positive mouse neurons and that Gpr17 expression increased during
fasting. Gpr17 expression was decreased in Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive
neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Foxo1
bound the Gpr17 promoter. Ren et al. (2012) concluded that
downregulation of Gpr17, at least in part, mediates the anorexigenic
phenotype of Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blasius et al. (1998) noted that the organization of the GPR17 gene
differs from that of many other GPCRs in that the ORF is distributed on
2 exons, with an additional exon containing the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Raport et al. (1996) mapped the R12
gene to chromosome 2. Blasius et al. (1998) regionalized the HIP4/FB1
gene to chromosome 2q21 using fluorescence in situ hybridization.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNM1L belongs to the dynamin (see DNM1; 602377) family of large GTPases
that mediate membrane remodeling during a variety of cellular processes.
DNM1L has an important role in the division of growing mitochondria and
peroxisomes (summary by Pitts et al. (2004)).

CLONING

By PCR amplification of human hepatoma HepG2 cDNA using oligonucleotides
based on human ESTs homologous to Vps1 and Dnm1 (602377), Shin et al.
(1997) obtained a partial cDNA which they used to screen a HepG2 cDNA
library. They isolated cDNAs encoding a predicted 736-amino acid
protein, DNM1L, which they designated DVLP. DVLP contains the highly
conserved N-terminal tripartite GTP-binding domain, but it lacks the
pleckstrin homology domain and proline-rich region. It shares 45% and
42% amino acid identity with yeast Dnm1 and Vps1, respectively.
Immunofluorescence studies of mammalian cells showed that DVLP localized
to the perinuclear region and did not colocalize with endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) or Golgi marker proteins.

By searching an EST database with a rat dynamin-3 (see 611445) amino
acid sequence, Imoto et al. (1998) identified a human cDNA encoding
DNM1L, which they called DRP1. Northern blot analysis indicated that
DRP1 was expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with highest levels in
skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and brain. Immunolocalization studies
showed that DRP1 was enriched in a perinuclear compartment that labeled
with ER and Golgi markers. The localization of DRP1 was highly similar
to the localization of the ER and cis-Golgi GTPase RAB1 (179508), but
not to the localization of the trans-Golgi GTPase RAB6 (179513).

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA expression library with serum from a
scleroderma (181750) patient, Kamimoto et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs
encoding DNM1L, which they referred to as DYMPLE. They identified cDNAs
corresponding to 3 alternatively spliced DYMPLE transcripts, which
encode a deduced 736-amino acid protein and deduced isoforms containing
a 29- or 37-amino acid deletion in the C-terminal region. RT-PCR
analysis of mouse tissues demonstrated that alternative splicing
occurred in a tissue-specific manner. Northern blot analysis detected
2.5- and 4.2-kb DYMPLE transcripts in all human tissues examined. The
authors reported that these transcripts were alternatively
polyadenylated. In situ hybridization analysis of mouse brain showed
abundant expression of Dymple mRNA in the cerebellum and in several
regions of the cerebrum and diencephalon. High levels of Dymple mRNA
were found in cerebellar Purkinje cells and pontile giant neurons.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with
glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK3B; 605004), Hong et al. (1998)
isolated a human fetal liver cDNA encoding DNM1L, which they called
dynamin-like protein-4 (DYNIV). The deduced protein contains 699 amino
acids.

Howng et al. (2004) identified 4 DYNIV splice variants that encode the
full-length 736-amino acid protein and 699-, 710-, and 725-amino acid
isoforms. All isoforms contain an N-terminal tripartite
GTPase/GTP-binding site, and the shorter isoforms bear various in-frame
deletions in their C-terminal halves relative to full-length DYNIV.
RT-PCR detected variable expression of all 4 splice variants in 6 human
cell lines examined.

Pitts et al. (2004) noted that DLP1 has a dynamin-like protein
structure, with a conserved N-terminal GTPase domain, followed by a
conserved middle domain, a nonconserved region, and a conserved
C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Yoon (2010) stated that there are 12
splice variants of rat Dlp1 that encode proteins of 705 to 761 amino
acids. The differential splicing results in changes within the GTPase
and nonconserved domains.

GENE FAMILY

The dynamin superfamily of GTPases is divided into subfamilies on the
basis of structural similarity. Members of the dynamin subfamily,
including dynamin-1 (DNM1; 602377), dynamin-2 (DNM2; 602378), and
dynamin-3 (DNM3; 611445), contain an N-terminal tripartite GTPase
domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich
region. Dynamin subfamily members have been shown to participate in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Members of the
dynamin-related subfamily, including the S. cerevisiae proteins Dnm1 and
Vps1, contain the N-terminal tripartite GTPase domain but do not have
the pleckstrin homology or proline-rich domains. Vps1 has been shown to
play a role in vesicular transport from the late Golgi compartment to
vacuoles, and Dnm1 is thought to be involved in endosomal trafficking.
Furthermore, Dnm1 has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of
mitochondrial morphology (Otsuga et al., 1998). Mitochondria exist as a
dynamic tubular network with projections that move, break, and reseal in
response to local environmental changes. Dnm1 is required for the
cortical distribution of this network.

GENE FUNCTION

To determine the function of DRP1 (DNM1L), Smirnova et al. (1998)
expressed mutant DRP1 in COS-7 cells. A mutation in the GTPase domain
caused profound alterations in mitochondrial morphology. In cells
expressing mutant DRP1, the tubular projections normally present in
wildtype cells were retracted into large perinuclear aggregates. By
electron microscopy, the mitochondrial aggregates appeared as clusters
of tubules rather than as a large mass of coalescing membrane. The
morphology of other organelles was unaffected by mutant DRP1. In
addition, mutant DRP1 had no effect on the transport functions of the
secretory and endocytic pathways. The authors proposed that DRP1
establishes mitochondrial morphology through a role in distributing
mitochondrial tubules throughout the cytoplasm. They suggested that DRP1
is the functional equivalent of yeast Dnm1.

Imoto et al. (1998) demonstrated that overexpression of wildtype human
DRP1 in mammalian cells increased secretion of a luciferase reporter
protein, whereas overexpression of a GTP-binding site mutant of DRP1
decreased secretion of this marker.

Using an in vitro GTPase assay, Kamimoto et al. (1998) showed that a
bacterially expressed DYMPLE fusion protein hydrolyzed GTP without
additive modifications or coactivators.

Hong et al. (1998) showed that the C-terminal region of the 699-amino
acid DYNIV protein bound to GSK3B.

Shin et al. (1999) found that DNM1L was oligomeric, probably tetrameric,
under physiologic salt conditions, and that it aggregated into
sedimentable complexes under low salt conditions. Analyses using the
yeast 2-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation showed that the N-terminal
and C-terminal regions of DNM1L could interact with each other.

Pitts et al. (1999) transiently transfected normal rat liver cells with
wildtype rat Dlp1 and Dlp1 containing point mutations within conserved
GTP-binding domains. Wildtype Dlp1 localized to distinct nonrandom foci
along the length of mitochondria and in linear arrays on microtubules
and the ER. Expression of the mutant proteins caused a pronounced
collapse of mitochondria into the cell center. The ER of cells
expressing mutant Dlp1 was also less distinct and appeared vesiculated.

Unlike the diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of wildtype DRP1, Santel and
Fuller (2001) found that a GTPase-dead DRP1 mutant distributed to
punctate structures in transfected COS-7 cells. In addition,
mitochondria formed perinuclear aggregates similar to the aggregates
formed in cells overexpressing mitofusin-2 (MFN2; 608507). COS-7 cells
cotransfected with the GTPase-dead DRP1 and MFN2 developed mitochondrial
tubules that extended from the perinuclear mitochondrial cluster towards
the cell periphery. Santel and Fuller (2001) concluded that the size and
morphologic arrangement of mitochondria are due to a dynamic balance
between MFN-dependent mitochondrial fusion and DRP1-dependent
mitochondrial fission.

Yoon et al. (2003) observed that human FIS1 (609003) and rat Dlp1 formed
a complex in transfected cells and could interact with each other
directly in vitro. These and other findings provided evidence that FIS1
regulates mitochondrial fission through a protein-protein interaction
that recruits DLP1 from the cytosol to the mitochondrial surface.

Li and Gould (2003) showed that overexpression of PEX11-beta (PEX11B;
603867) in human fibroblasts induced peroxisome division in a multistep
process involving elongation of preexisting peroxisomes followed by
their division. They found that DLP1 was essential for the peroxisome
division. The 710-amino acid DLP1 isoform, DLP1a, associated with
peroxisomes, and PEX11-beta overexpression recruited DLP1a to peroxisome
membranes. DLP1a and PEX11 proteins did not appear to interact directly.

By swapping domains between rat Dnm2 and rat Dlp1, Pitts et al. (2004)
showed that the coiled-coil domain of Dlp1 conferred mitochondrial
targeting to the protein. However, the mitochondria-specific function of
Dlp1 also required the middle and nonconserved domains.

Jagasia et al. (2005) showed that Drp1, a key component of the
mitochondrial fission machinery, was required and sufficient to induce
mitochondrial fragmentation and programmed cell death during C. elegans
development.

Germain et al. (2005) found that fluorescence-tagged rodent Drp1 was
expressed in the cytosol of COS-7 cells, and that treatment of COS-7 and
human cells with the apoptotic protein BIK (603392) resulted in
recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria prior to mitochondrial
fragmentation. Drp1 maintained association with mitochondria during
their initial shape change and following loss of mitochondrial potential
and mobilization of cytochrome c (123970). Transmission electron
microscopy showed that BIK expression caused profound opening of
mitochondrial cristae, and these changes were inhibited by expression of
a dominant-negative Drp1 mutant. Germain et al. (2005) concluded that
DRP1 is involved in remodeling and opening of mitochondrial cristae
during apoptosis, and that this function of DRP1 is distinct from its
role in mitochondrial fission.

Type III, or necrosis-like, programmed cell death (PCD) is defined
exclusively by cytoplasmic features and seems to operate in a
caspase-independent manner. Bras et al. (2007) showed that ligation of
CD47 (601028) triggered type III PCD in B cells from healthy volunteers
and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; 151400), and they
identified DRP1 as a key mediator of this PCD. CD47 ligation induced
DRP1 translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria. In mitochondria,
DRP1 provoked impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain,
resulting in dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential,
generation of reactive oxygen species, and a drop in ATP levels.
Responsiveness of cells to CD47 ligation increased following DRP1
overexpression, while resistance to CD47-mediated death was observed
following DRP1 downregulation. In CLL B cells, DRP1 mRNA levels strongly
correlated with death sensitivity.

Cho et al. (2009) found that nitric oxide produced in response to
beta-amyloid protein (104760), thought to be a key mediator of Alzheimer
disease (see 104300), triggered mitochondrial fission, synaptic loss,
and neuronal damage, in part via S-nitrosylation of DRP1 (forming
SNO-DRP1). Preventing nitrosylation of DRP1 by cysteine mutation
abrogated these neurotoxic events. Cho et al. (2009) showed that
SNO-DRP1 is increased in brains of human Alzheimer disease patients and
may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.

Malena et al. (2009) tested the hypothesis that altering the balance
between mitochondrial fusion and fission could influence the segregation
of mutant and wildtype mtDNA variants, because it would modify the
number of organelles per cell. Human cells heteroplasmic for the
pathologic 3243A-G (MTTL1; 590050.0001) mitochondrial DNA mutation were
transfected with constructs designed to silence DRP1 or human FIS1
(TTC11; 609003), whose gene products are required for mitochondrial
fission. DRP1 and FIS1 gene silencing were both associated with
increased levels of mutant mitochondrial DNA. The authors concluded that
the extent of the mitochondrial reticular network appears to be an
important factor in determining mutant load.

Huntington disease (HD; 143100) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused
by abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in huntingtin
(HTT; 613004). Song et al. (2011) found mitochondrial abnormalities,
including fragmentation, altered cristae morphology, and arrested
intracellular movement, in fibroblasts from a patient with HD and in
neurons of rodent models of HD. Immunoprecipitation of normal and HD
human or mouse brain indicated that mutant, but not normal, huntingtin
interacted with Drp1. In vitro assays with liposomes that mimicked the
mitochondrial outer membrane revealed that mutant huntingtin stimulated
Drp1 GTPase activity. Expression of a dominant-negative Drp1 mutant
rescued mutant huntingtin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation, defects
in mitochondrial transport, and neuronal cell death. Electron microscopy
showed that the normal ring- and spiral-like organization of DRP1
oligomers had an additional layer of density with the addition of
mutant, but not normal, huntingtin.

Using Western blot analysis, Wang et al. (2011) found that the
phosphorylated form of Drp1 accumulated in the cytosol of control
neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, whereas the unphosphorylated form of Drp1
accumulated in mitochondria-enriched fractions following anoxia
treatment. Drp1 translocation to mitochondria was associated with
anoxia-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis. Wang et al.
(2011) characterized upstream events in this apoptotic pathway and found
that p53 (TP53; 191170) downregulated expression of microRNA-499
(MIR499; 613614), which relieved Mir499-dependent repression of the
calcineurin catalytic subunits Cna-alpha (PPP3CA; 114105) and Cna-beta
(PPP3CB; 114106). Knockdown of either Cna-alpha or Cna-beta via small
interfering RNA attenuated dephosphorylation-dependent Drp1 accumulation
in mitochondria, mitochondria fragmentation, and anoxia-induced cell
death.

Endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria exhibit tightly coupled dynamics
and have extensive contacts. In yeast and mammalian cells, Friedman et
al. (2011) tested whether endoplasmic reticulum plays a role in
mitochondrial division. They found that mitochondrial division occurred
at positions where endoplasmic reticulum tubules contacted mitochondria
and mediated constriction before Drp1 recruitment. Friedman et al.
(2011) concluded that endoplasmic reticulum may play an active role in
defining the position of mitochondrial division sites.

Wang et al. (2012) found that RIP1 (RIPK1; 603453), RIP3 (RIPK3;
605817), and MLKL (615153) formed a necrosis complex in human cell
lines. Upon induction of necrosis by TNF-alpha (191160), both isoforms
of PGAM5 (614939), PGAM5L and PGAM5S, interacted with the RIP1-RIP3-MLKL
necrosis complex and were phosphorylated. Phosphorylated PGAM5S then
recruited DRP1 and activated DRP1 by dephosphorylation, resulting in
mitochondrial fragmentation and execution of necrosis. Blockade of
phosphorylation or dephosphorylation signaling at several points in this
signaling cascade, or knockdown of PGAM5 expression, blocked
TNF-alpha-induced necrosis. Knockdown experiments showed that both PGAM5
isoforms and DRP1, but not RIP1, RIP3, or MLKL, were also involved in
necrosis induced by reactive oxygen species or ionophore-mediated
calcium shock.

Korobova et al. (2013) found that actin polymerization through
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized inverted formin-2 (INF2; 610982)
was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells.
INF2 functioned upstream of DRP1. Actin filaments appeared to accumulate
between mitochondria and INF2-enriched ER membranes at constriction
sites. Thus, INF2-induced actin filaments may drive initial
mitochondrial constriction, which allows DRP1-driven secondary
constriction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Howng et al. (2004) determined that the DNM1L gene contains 20 exons and
spans 64 kb. Exons 15 and 16 are subject to differential splicing. The
5-prime flanking sequence contains 3 GC boxes that concatenate AP2
(TFAP2A; 107580)- and SP1 (189906)-binding motifs, but it lacks TATA or
CAAT consensus sequences. Deletion analysis located the minimal promoter
at nucleotides -108 to -100.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Howng et al. (2004) mapped the DNM1L gene
to chromosome 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a newborn girl with a lethal encephalopathy due to defective
mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission (EMPF; 614388), Waterham et al.
(2007) identified a de novo heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in
the dynamin gene DLP1 (A395D; 603850.0001). The affected infant showed
microcephaly, abnormal brain development, optic atrophy and hypoplasia,
persistent lactic acidemia, and a mildly elevated plasma concentration
of very long-chain fatty acids. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
detected an abnormal gyral pattern in both frontal lobes and was
associated with dysmyelination. Death occurred at 37 days of age.
Immunofluorescence microscopic analyses showed fewer peroxisomes in
fibroblasts from the patient of Waterham et al. (2007) than in
fibroblasts from control subjects. Furthermore, the peroxisomes from the
patient varied markedly in size and were frequently arranged in rows.
This arrangement was similar to that seen in mammalian cells
overexpressing dominant-negative mutant DLP1 or those with DLP1
expression that had been downregulated owing to RNA interference (Koch
et al., 2003; Li and Gould, 2003). Because such mammalian cells also
showed a defect in mitochondrial fission (Smirnova et al., 2001; Yoon et
al., 2001), Waterham et al. (2007) studied the mitochondria of
fibroblasts from the patient using a fluorescent mitochondrial probe.
Mitochondria in the patient's fibroblasts were elongated, tangled,
tubular structures concentrated predominantly around the nucleus.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ishihara et al. (2009) found that Drp1 deletion in mice was embryonic
lethal. Drp1 -/- embryos showed reduced development of the heart and
liver, as well as thinned neural tube cell layer. Electron microscopy
revealed that Drp1 -/- embryos had enlarged mitochondria with normal
cristae and cytochrome c oxidase (see 516030) activity. Embryonic
fibroblasts and stem cells from Drp1 -/- mice were healthy and
proliferated normally. The ER and Golgi of Drp1 -/- cells appeared
normal, but their mitochondria were abnormally extended and clustered
near the nucleus. Peroxisomes were also swollen in Drp1 -/- cells.
Cytokinesis in Drp1 -/- fibroblasts proceeded asymmetrically, with
filamentous and highly clustered mitochondria cleaved at a constriction
site of the cell in concert with cytokinesis and segregated unequally
into the daughter cells. Treatment of Drp1 -/- cells with proapoptotic
reagents suggested that Drp1 is involved in later apoptotic events,
including cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Mice with neural
cell-specific Drp1 deletion (NS-Drp1 -/- mice) died shortly after birth
as a result of brain hypoplasia and apoptosis. Primary cultures of
NS-Drp1 -/- mouse forebrain showed decreased number of neurites and
defective synapse formation, suggesting that aggregated mitochondria
fail to distribute properly within neural cell processes. NS-Drp1 -/-
neuronal cells were also highly sensitive to Ca(2+)-dependent apoptosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ENCEPHALOPATHY, LETHAL, DUE TO DEFECTIVE MITOCHONDRIAL AND PEROXISOMAL
FISSION
DNM1L, ALA395ASP

In an infant with a lethal encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial
and peroxisomal fission (EMPF; 614388), Waterham et al. (2007) found
heterozygosity for a 1184C-A transversion in the DNM1L gene that
resulted in an ala395-to-asp (A395D) substitution in the middle domain
of the protein. The mutation was not found in genomic DNA from blood
cells from either parent, indicating that the mutation either was de
novo or was present only in germline cells of 1 parent. The patient
presented in the first days of life with microcephaly, abnormal brain
development, optic atrophy and hypoplasia, and lactic acidemia, and died
at age 37 days. Overexpression of mutant DNM1L from the patient in
fibroblasts from control subjects induced aberrant mitochondrial and
peroxisomal phenotypes, indicating that the mutation acted in a
dominant-negative manner.

605453	TITLE *605453 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 9; ABCB9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691). In addition to the 'full' ABC
transporters with 2 transmembrane domains and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain only 1 of each domain
(e.g., ABCB1; 171050). Full transporters are usually found in the plasma
membrane, whereas half transporters are found in subcellular organelles.

By searching an EST database and screening a T-lymphoblast cDNA library,
Zhang et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCB9. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 766-amino acid ABCB9 protein has 10 potential
N-terminal transmembrane segments. ABCB9 shares 94% identity with the
rodent sequences and is approximately 39% identical to 2 human
endoplasmic reticulum half transporters, TAP1 (ABCB2; 170260) and TAP2
(ABCB3; 170261). RT-PCR and genomic sequence analysis established the
existence of a splice variant with a 129-bp deletion expressed in testis
and brain. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of a 3.7-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with an additional 2.2-kb transcript
detected in tissues with relatively high expression, such as testis.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 72-kD nonglycosylated
protein, significantly smaller than the predicted mass of 84.5 kD, that
was enriched in lysosomes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of ABCB9 with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and
LAMP2 (309060). Immunohistochemical analysis detected ABCB9 expression
in Sertoli cells of rodent seminiferous tubules.

Allikmets et al. (1996) mapped an EST corresponding to the ABCB9 gene to
12q24.

601089	TITLE *601089 FORKHEAD BOX F1; FOXF1
;;FORKHEAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE 5; FKHL5;;
FORKHEAD-RELATED ACTIVATOR 1; FREAC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The forkhead genes are transcription factors distinguished by a
characteristic 100-amino acid motif that was originally identified in
Drosophila (see 164874).

CLONING

Pierrou et al. (1994) identified 7 human genes containing forkhead
domains and designated them forkhead-related activators (FREAC) 1
through 7. Northern blot analysis revealed that the FREAC1, or FKHL5,
gene is expressed as a 2.6-kb mRNA in placenta and adult and fetal lung.

Hellqvist et al. (1996) reported the FREAC1 cDNA sequence. The predicted
354-amino acid protein is nearly identical to FREAC2 (FKHL6; 603250)
within a 112-residue region containing the forkhead domain and adjacent
sequences, and within the C-terminal region. Hellqvist et al. (1996)
reported that the mouse HFH8 gene and FREAC1 share 90% nucleotide
sequence identity. By resequencing of HFH8, these authors demonstrated
that 5 frameshifts in the HFH8 sequence reported by Clevidence et al.
(1994) were due to sequencing errors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Madison et al. (2009) found that the upstream region of the FOXF1 gene
contains 2 conserved GLI (see GLI1; 165220)-binding sites, as well as
MEF2 (see 600660) and forkhead consensus sites.

Szafranski et al. (2013) reported that the 5.5-kb FOXF1 promoter region,
which is located immediately upstream of the FOXF1 translation start
site, contains several GLI-binding sites and partly overlaps a long
noncoding RNA (lncRNA), FOXF1AS1 (614975), on the opposite strand. The
promoter region is located within a large CpG island that extends into
FOXF1 exon 1. Szafranski et al. (2013) also identified a 75-kb distant
regulatory region located in a region lacking protein-coding genes
between 332 and 257 kb upstream of the FOXF1 translation start site.
This region contains several sequences conserved among vertebrates,
including 2 lncRNAs, TCONS_00024764 (614977) and TCONS_00024492
(614978), a cluster of predicted binding sites for GLI1, GLI2 (165230),
and GLI3 (165240), and a CpG island. Chromosome conformation capture
analysis suggested chromatin looping between the distant regulatory
region and the FOXF1 promoter.

MAPPING

Larsson et al. (1995) mapped the FKHL5 gene to chromosome 16q24 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analysis.

Madison et al. (2009) stated that mouse Foxf1 maps to a region of
chromosome 8 containing several genes encoding forkhead transcription
factors.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a reporter gene construct containing FREAC2 binding sequences in
the promoter, Hellqvist et al. (1996) demonstrated that both FREAC1 and
FREAC2 have C-terminal transcriptional activation domains. FREAC1/FREAC2
binding sequences are present in the promoters of several lung-specific
genes, including CC10 (192020) and SPB (SFTPB; 178640). While both
FREAC1 and FREAC2 transactivated an SPB promoter construct, CC10 was
activated only by FREAC1. CC10 activation occurred specifically in a
lung cell line with Clara cell-like characteristics.

Madison et al. (2009) found that expression of Foxf1 and Foxl1 (603252)
in developing mouse stomach and intestine was dependent on Gli2 (165230)
and Gli3 (165240) and was induced by an N-terminal fragment of Shh
(600725). Several highly conserved Gli-binding sites appeared crucial
for Gli-mediated binding and transcriptional activation of Foxf1 and
Foxl1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 10 patients with alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of
pulmonary veins (ACDMPV; 265380) associated with multiple congenital
anomalies, Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified 6 overlapping
microdeletions encompassing the FOX transcription factor gene cluster,
all but 1 of which included the FOXF1 gene. By sequencing the FOXF1 gene
in 18 additional patients with ACDMPV, Stankiewicz et al. (2009)
identified heterozygosity for 1 nonsense, 1 no-stop, and 2 frameshift
mutations in 4 unrelated patients (601089.0001-601089.0004,
respectively). Stankiewicz et al. (2009) noted that in contrast to the
association of point mutations in FOXF1 with bowel malrotation,
microdeletions of FOXF1 were associated with hypoplastic left heart
syndrome and gastrointestinal atresias, which they suggested was due to
haploinsufficiency for the neighboring FOXC2 (602402) and FOXL1 (603252)
genes.

Sen et al. (2013) provided a comprehensive list of 42 identified FOXF1
variants in patients with ACDMPV. Twenty-five (60%) of the variants were
located within the putative DNA-binding domain, indicating its plausible
role in FOXF1 function. The majority of the ACDMPV cases were sporadic.
Only 4 cases were familial, of which 3 showed maternal inheritance
consistent with paternal imprinting of the gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kalinichenko et al. (2002) reported that haploinsufficiency of the Foxf1
gene caused pulmonary abnormalities with perinatal lethality from lung
hemorrhage in a subset of Foxf1 +/- newborn mice. They found that Foxf1
was expressed in embryonic septum transversum and gallbladder
mesenchyme, and that gallbladders of Foxf1 +/- mice showed severe
structural abnormalities. The Foxf1 +/- phenotype correlated with
decreased expression of Vcam1 (192225), alpha-5 integrin (135620), Pdgf
receptor-alpha (173490), and Hgf (142409), all of which are critical for
cell adhesion, migration, and mesenchymal cell differentiation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS
FOXF1, TYR50TER

In a male infant with congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia and
misalignment of the pulmonary veins (265380), previously reported by Sen
et al. (2004), who died on day 10 of life and was also found to have a
partial atrioventricular canal defect, patent ductus arteriosus,
intestinal malrotation, annular pancreas and duodenal stenosis,
bilateral hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and dilatation of the urinary
bladder, Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a
150C-A transversion in exon 1 of the FOXF1 gene, resulting in a
tyr50-to-ter (Y50X) substitution in the forkhead box F1 domain.

.0002
ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS
FOXF1, TER355ARG

In a male infant with congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia and
misalignment of the pulmonary veins (265380), who died at 47 days of
life and was also found to have intestinal malrotation and Meckel
diverticulum, Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a
1063T-C transition in exon 2 of the FOXF1 gene, resulting in a
ter355-to-arg (X355R) substitution, predicted to lengthen the protein by
73 amino acids.

.0003
ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS
FOXF1, 1-BP DUP, 775T

In a male infant with congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia and
misalignment of the pulmonary veins (265380), who died 12 hours after
birth and was also found to have obstructive renal dysplasia,
Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp
duplication in exon 1 of the FOXF1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination of the protein.

.0004
ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS
FOXF1, 2-BP DEL, 956TT

In a female infant with congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia and
misalignment of the pulmonary veins (265380), who died at 1 day of life
and who was also found to have partial anomalous pulmonary venous
connection with absence of the left upper lobe pulmonary vein,
congenital short bowel with malrotation, a small omphalocele, bilateral
severe hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and bladder dilatation, as well as
micrognathia and low-set ears, Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (956delTT) in exon 2 of the FOXF1
gene, predicted to add 29 amino acids to the protein.

;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT C1q, C CHAIN;;
COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 1, q SUBCOMPONENT, GAMMA POLYPEPTIDE; C1QG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

C1q, the first subcomponent of C1, has a complicated 18-chain structure:
6 A, 6 B, and 6 C chains. Each chain has a stretch of about 80 amino
acids with the collagenous triplet Gly-X-Y where X and Y can include
hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. The A (120550), B (120570), and C
chains combine to form 6 heteromeric triple helices in the collagenous
regions of the chains (Sellar et al., 1991).

MAPPING

Sellar et al. (1991) found that the genes encoding the A, B, and C
chains of human C1q are aligned, 5-prime to 3-prime, in the same
orientation in the order A-C-B on a 24-kb stretch of DNA on chromosome
1p. A and C are separated by 4 kb and B and C are separated by 11 kb.
Hybridization of cDNA probes to a hybrid cell line containing the
derived X chromosome from an X;1(q21.2;p34) translocation described in a
female patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Lindenbaum et al.,
1979; Boyd et al., 1988) showed that the A and B genes are located in
the region 1p36.3-p34.1 (Sellar et al., 1992).

GENE STRUCTURE

The A- (120550), B- (120570), and C-chain C1q genes are approximately
2.5, 2.6, and 3.2 kb long, respectively, and each contains 1 intron
located within a codon for a glycine residue found halfway along the
collagen-like region present in each chain. These glycine residues are
located just before the point where the triple-helical portions of the
C1q molecule appear to bend when viewed by electron microscopy. Southern
blot analysis showed that there is only one gene per chain.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with C1q deficiency (613652), Slingsby et al. (1996)
identified homozygous mutations in the C1QC gene
(120575.0001-120575.0003).

in-frame at position 108.

.0002

In a patient with C1q deficiency (613652), Slingsby et al. (1996)

In patients from 2 racially distinct groups, Slingsby et al. (1996) and
Kirschfink et al. (1993) described the same homozygous point mutation as
the cause of dysfunctional C1q deficiency (613652): a G-to-A transition
at position 6 of the C chain.

606305	TITLE *606305 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 4; PCDHGC4
;;PCDH-GAMMA-C4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGC4
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

Using PCR on a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) obtained cDNAs
encoding PCDHGC4. Sequence analysis predicted that the 938-amino acid
PCDHGC4 protein (GenBank GENBANK AAD43732) is 48% identical to PCDHGA3
(606290). The C-terminal 134 amino acids of PCDHGC4 and PCDHGA3 are
identical and have a lysine-rich motif. PCDHGC4 has a signal peptide, 2
putative N-linked glycosylation sites, 6 cadherin ectodomains, a
transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic domain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGC4 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between PCDHGC3 (603627) and PCDHGC5 (606306). They
localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

607274	TITLE *607274 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 14; USP14
;;tRNA-GUANINE TRANSGLYCOSYLASE, 60-KD SUBUNIT;;
TGT, 60-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Eukaryotes synthesize queuosine by the irreversible exchange of queuine
for guanine at tRNA position 34, a reaction catalyzed by tRNA-guanine
transglycosylase (TGT). Mammalian TGT appears to be a dimer of 60- and
43-kD subunits. Deshpande et al. (1996) determined that the purified
rabbit 60-kD Tgt subunit, or Usp14, shares significant sequence identity
with human TRE2 (USP6; 604334) and ORF8 (USP8; 603158), particularly in
the conserved cys and his domains. Using the rabbit sequence, they
identified an EST containing human USP14 and cloned the cDNA from a
placenta cDNA library. The deduced human protein contains 494 amino
acids and shares 98% sequence identity with the rabbit protein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the USP14
gene to chromosome 18 (TMAP SJGC-11272). Wilson et al. (2002) stated
that 2 human neurologic disorders possibly involving alterations of
synaptic function map to 18p near USP14: major affective disorder-1
(MAFD1; 125480) and schizophrenia disorder 8 (SCZD8; 603206).

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2010) showed that USP14, a proteasome-associated
deubiquitinating enzyme, can inhibit the degradation of
ubiquitin-protein conjugates both in vitro and in vivo and in cells. A
catalytically inactive variant of USP14 has reduced inhibitory activity,
indicating that inhibition is mediated by trimming of the ubiquitin
chain on the substrate. A high-throughput screen identified a selective
small-molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of human
USP14. Treatment of cultured cells with this compound enhanced
degradation of several proteasome substrates that have been implicated
in neurodegenerative disease. USP14 inhibition accelerated the
degradation of oxidized proteins and enhanced resistance to oxidative
stress.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice that are homozygous with respect to the spontaneous mutation ax(J)
in the ataxia (ax) gene develop severe tremors by 2 to 3 weeks of age
followed by hindlimb paralysis and death by 6 to 10 weeks of age. Wilson
et al. (2002) showed that ax encodes Usp14, one of the large family of
cysteine proteases that specifically feed ubiquitin conjugates. Although
Usp14 can cleave a ubiquitin-tagged protein in vitro, it is unable to
process polyubiquitin, which is believed to be associated with the
protein aggregates seen in Parkinson disease, spinocerebellar ataxia
type 1 (SCA1; 164400), and gracile axonal dystrophy (GAD) in mice. The
physiologic substrate of Usp14 may therefore contain a monoubiquitin
side chain, the removal of which would regulate processes such as
protein localization and protein activity. Expression of Usp14 is
altered in homozygous ax(J) mice as a result of the insertion of an
intracisternal A particle (IAP) into intron 5 of Usp14. In contrast to
other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease and SCA1 in
humans and GAD in mice, neither ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates
nor neuronal cell loss was detectable in the CNS of ax(J) mice. Instead,
these mice had defects in synaptic transmission in both the central and
peripheral nervous systems. These results suggested that ubiquitin
proteases are important in regulating synaptic activity in mammals.

;;SCAVENGER RECEPTOR EXPRESSED BY ENDOTHELIAL CELLS; SREC;;
SREC1;;
SREC I;;
KIAA0149
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Scavenger receptors mediate the endocytosis of chemically modified
lipoproteins. SCARF1 specifically mediates the selective uptake of
acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) into endothelial cells.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a myeloid leukemia cell cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (1995) cloned SCARF1, which they designated KIAA0149. The
deduced 830-amino acid protein contains a putative transmembrane domain
and an EGF-like pattern of cysteine repeats. SCARF1 shares about 33%
identity over 147 amino acids with mouse Tie2 (600221), an epithelial
receptor tyrosine kinase. The 3-prime untranslated region contains an
Alu repeat. Northern blot analysis detected expression in most tissues
examined, with highest levels in lung and spleen. No expression was
detected in HeLa cells, pancreas, or colon.

Adachi et al. (1997) cloned SCARF1, which they designated SREC, using an
expression cloning strategy in which they assayed for uptake of
fluorescence-labeled Ac-LDL into CHO cells transfected with a human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library. The deduced
830-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 86 kD.
SCARF1 contains a hydrophobic signal sequence followed by 5 EGF-like
cysteine pattern signatures in its extracellular N-terminal half, a
transmembrane region, and an intracellular C-terminal half containing a
serine/proline-rich region followed by a glycine-rich region. It has 3
potential N-glycosylation sites and several putative sites for serine
and threonine phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.5-kb
transcript expressed in HUVECs and in coronary artery endothelial cells,
but not in coronary artery smooth muscle cells.

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) identified several SCARF1 variants in a
peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library. Alternative splicing introduces
a stop codon before the transmembrane region in 2 of the variants,
resulting in soluble forms of SCARF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Adachi et al. (1997) determined that CHO cells stably expressing SCARF1
bound radiolabeled Ac-LDL with high affinity and degraded it via an
endocytic pathway. The association between SCARF1 and Ac-LDL was
inhibited by oxidized LDL, malondialdehyde-modified LDL, dextran
sulfate, and polyinosinic acid, but not by natural LDL or heparin.

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) determined that all membrane-bound splice
variants of SCARF1 showed receptor activity toward Ac-LDL. They
identified a transcriptional activator of SCARF1, ZNF444 (607874).
Overexpression of ZNF444 in HUVECs increased SCARF1 promoter activity
nearly 2.5-fold. An intact SP1 (189906) motif and an intact inverted
repeat sequence with a triple-nucleotide spacer (IR3), which binds
ZNF444, were required for maximal SCARF1 expression. Several
inflammatory cytokines inhibited SCARF1 promoter activity in vitro and
decreased Ac-LDL uptake in vivo.

Means et al. (2009) showed that the scavenger receptors Scarf1 and Cd36
(173510) mediated mouse defense against 2 fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus
neoformans and Candida albicans, by enabling production of antimicrobial
peptides. Studies in C. elegans indicated that the homologous proteins
protected nematodes. Macrophage binding and cytokine production required
Cd36, but not Tlr2 (603028), and binding was dependent on recognition of
pathogen beta-glucans. Mice lacking Cd36, but expressing other
beta-glucan receptors (e.g., CLEC7A; 606264), had a higher fungal burden
and greater mortality after intravenous infection with C. neoformans
compared with wildtype mice. Means et al. (2009) concluded that SCARF1
and CD36 are beta-glucan-binding receptors and are involved in an
evolutionarily conserved pathway for the innate sensing of fungal
pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) determined that the SCARF1 gene contains 11
exons and spans 12 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks TATA and CCAAT
boxes, but it contains several putative motifs for DNA-binding elements,
including an SP1 motif and an IR3 sequence that binds ZNF444.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human/rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the
SCARF1 gene to chromosome 17.

606591	TITLE *606591 MUS81, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; MUS81
;;SLX3, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SLX3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences with similarity to S. pombe and S. cerevisiae
Mus81, followed by PCR using a cerebellum cDNA library, Chen et al.
(2001) cloned the human homolog of yeast Mus81. The open reading frame
of human MUS81 predicts a translation product of 551 amino acids with a
molecular mass of 59 kD. The predicted protein has 25% identity to Mus81
of fission yeast. Sequence alignment of the human, mouse, fission yeast,
and budding yeast proteins revealed that the similarity is highest
around the VERKX3D motif, which is conserved in the XPF family of
nucleases. Helix-hairpin-helix DNA-binding domains in the N and C
termini of the protein also appeared to be conserved. Northern blot
analysis showed that MUS81 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in several
human cell types and cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2001) showed that MUS81 has associated endonuclease
activity against structure-specific oligonucleotide substrates,
including synthetic Holliday junctions. MUS81-associated endonuclease
resolved Holliday junctions into linear duplexes by cutting across the
junction exclusively on strands of like polarity. In addition, MUS81
protein abundance increased in cells following exposure to agents that
block DNA replication. Taken together, these findings suggested a role
for MUS81 in resolving Holliday junctions that arise when DNA
replication is blocked by damage or by nucleotide depletion. The authors
stated that MUS81 is not related by sequence to previously characterized
Holliday junction-resolving enzymes, and it has distinct enzymatic
properties that suggest it uses a novel enzymatic strategy to cleave
Holliday junctions.

Ciccia et al. (2003) showed that recombinant MUS81 interacted with
recombinant EME1 (610885) and EME2 (610886). EME1/MUS81 heterodimers
showed DNA endonuclease activity against 3-prime flap and replication
fork substrates, but activity was much lower against splayed arm and
Holliday junction substrates. Neither EME1 nor MUS81 alone showed
nuclease activity.

Ciccia et al. (2007) found that the EME2/MUS81 heterodimer exhibited DNA
endonuclease activity against 3-prime flap and splayed arm substrates.

Zeng et al. (2009) showed that MUS81 contributes to the alternative
lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway for maintenance of telomere
length in telomerase-negative human cancer cell lines that utilized the
ALT pathway. In ALT cells only, MUS81 localized to PML (102578)-positive
nuclear bodies and with telomeric DNA, which was enriched during the G2
phase of the cell cycle in synchronized ALT cells. Depletion of MUS81
via short hairpin RNA in ALT cells resulted in reduced ALT-specific
recombination, defective S phase and proliferation, and loss of telomere
signals. MUS81 did not participate in global telomere maintenance in
non-ALT cell lines. Mutation analysis showed that the endonuclease
activity of MUS81 was required for recombination-based ALT cell
survival. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and mass spectrometry revealed
that MUS81 interacted with TRF2 (TERF2; 602027) as well as EME1. The
interaction of MUS81 with TRF2 inhibited the nuclease activity of MUS81;
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the binding of MUS81
to TRF2 interfered with the binding of MUS81 to DNA. Zeng et al. (2009)
concluded that MUS81 is involved in the maintenance of ALT cell survival
at least in part by homologous recombination of telomeres.

Wechsler et al. (2011) used Bloom syndrome (210900) cells, in which the
BLM gene (604610) is inactive, to analyze human cells compromised for
the known Holliday junction dissolution/resolution pathways. Wechsler et
al. (2011) showed that depletion of MUS81 and GEN1 (612449), or SLX4
(613278) and GEN1, from Bloom syndrome cells results in severe
chromosome abnormalities, such that sister chromatids remain interlinked
in a side-by-side arrangement and the chromosomes are elongated and
segmented. Wechsler et al. (2011) concluded that normally replicating
human cells require Holliday junction processing activities to prevent
sister chromatid entanglements and thereby ensure accurate chromosome
condensation. This phenotype was not apparent when both MUS81 and SLX4
were depleted from Bloom syndrome cells, suggesting that GEN1 can
compensate for their absence. Additionally, Wechsler et al. (2011)
showed that depletion of MUS81 or SLX4 reduces the high frequency of
sister chromatid exchanges in Bloom syndrome cells, indicating that
MUS81 and SLX4 promote sister chromatid exchange formation, in events
that may ultimately drive the chromosome instabilities that underpin
early-onset cancers associated with Bloom syndrome.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2001) mapped the MUS81 gene to chromosome 11q13 by FISH and
confirmed the localization by genomic sequence analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

McPherson et al. (2004) used gene targeting to study the physiologic
requirements of Mus81 in mammals. Mus81-null mice were viable and
fertile, which indicates that mammalian Mus81 is not essential for
recombination processes associated with meiosis. Mus81-deficient mice
and cells were hypersensitive to the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C
but not to gamma-irradiation. Remarkably, both homozygous Mus81-null
mice and heterozygous Mus81 +/- mice exhibited a similar susceptibility
to spontaneous chromosomal damage and a profound and equivalent
predisposition to lymphomas and other cancers. McPherson et al. (2004)
concluded that their studies demonstrated a critical role for the proper
biallelic expression of the mammalian Mus81 in the maintenance of
genomic integrity and tumor suppression.

603354	TITLE *603354 GASTRULATION BRAIN HOMEOBOX 1; GBX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The homeobox is a 180-bp DNA sequence that encodes a DNA-binding domain
known as a homeodomain. See 142950. To identify additional homeobox
genes, Matsui et al. (1993) performed PCR using genomic DNA and
degenerate primers based on conserved regions of the homeodomain. They
isolated fragments of 2 novel homeobox genes, GBX1 and GBX2 (601135).
The amino acid sequence of the predicted GBX1 and GBX2 homeodomains were
identical. Sequence comparisons indicated that the GBX1/GBX2 homeodomain
was most similar to that of chicken CHox-7. Northern blot analysis
revealed that GBX1 was expressed as a 2.2-kb mRNA in 2 hematopoietic
cell lines. Matsui et al. (1993) reported that the GBX1 gene is the
human homolog of the mouse MMoxB, or Gbx1, gene identified by Murtha et
al. (1991).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Matsui et al. (1993) mapped the
GBX1 gene to 7q36.1. They noted that a second homeobox gene, EN2
(131310), has been mapped to the same region. The Gbx1 gene resides on
mouse chromosome 5.

PMR1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA1347
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP2C1 is a Golgi-localized ATPase that mediates Golgi uptake of
cytosolic Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and has a role in regulating Ca(2+) and
Mn(2+) cellular content (Ton et al., 2002).

CLONING

Hu et al. (2000) identified an EST corresponding to the ATP2C1 gene
within a 1.3-Mb YAC/BAC contig spanning the region of chromosome
3q21-q24 deleted in a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600).
This EST had been annotated as homologous to a yeast gene encoding a
calcium ATPase with a function predicted to be related to that of SERCA2
(ATP2A2; 108740). Hu et al. (2000) isolated the full-length cDNA
corresponding to the human EST. Similar to other Ca(2+) ATPase genes,
the ATP2C1 gene encodes 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, ATP2C1a and
ATP2C1b. These transcripts differed in their C termini (encoding amino
acids 877 to the end), but had the same expression patterns in all
tissues examined. ATP2C1a was predicted to encode 919 amino acids, and
ATP2C1b was predicted to encode 888 amino acids. The protein encoded by
ATP2C1 was highly homologous (97% identity) to rat Pmr1, which in turn
is homologous to the yeast calcium pump Pmr1, but less homologous to
other calcium pumps. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb ATP2C1
transcript in keratinocytes and in all 12 whole tissues examined.
Highest expression was in kidney and heart, and lowest expression was in
colon, thymus, and leukocytes. Patients with HHD are not known to have
extracutaneous manifestations of the disease. Hu et al. (2000) found no
differences in ATP2C1 mRNA levels between skin taken from the axilla and
skin from the buttock (sites particularly prone vs resistant to
blistering, respectively, in HHD patients) of one normal individual and
little change in ATP2C1 mRNA levels in normal human epidermal
keratinocytes cultured with glucocorticoid.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ATP2C1 clone, which they designated
KIAA1347. The deduced 918-amino acid protein shares 97% identity with
its rat ortholog, a calcium-transporting ATPase. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ATP2C1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary, followed by lung, testis, brain, liver, and
kidney. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression was
detected in thalamus, followed by amygdala and substantia nigra.

Ton et al. (2002) showed that epitope-tagged human SPCA1 localized to
the Golgi compartment following expression in yeast and Chinese hamster
ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2000) detected 27 exons in the ATP2C1 gene. Dobson-Stone et
al. (2002) detected 28 translated exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1
gene to chromosome 3. Hu et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Pmr1, the yeast ortholog of SPCA1, is expressed in the Golgi compartment
and functions as a high-affinity Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) pump involved in Ca(2+)
and Mn(2+) secretion. Deletion of Pmr1 in yeast causes hypersensitivity
to Ca(2+) chelators and Mn(2+) toxicity, with defects in protein
glycosylation, processing, sorting, and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-related glycosylation. Ton et al. (2002) found that heterologous
expression of human SPCA1, but not SERCA-type Ca(2+)-transporting
ATPases, reduced Mn(2+) toxicity and complemented Ca(2+)-related
phenotypes in Pmr1-null yeast. Yeast Golgi vesicles expressing human
SPCA1 showed high-affinity Ca(2+) transport activity that was
inhibitable by Mn(2+), but not by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of
SERCA-type ATPases. Ton et al. (2002) proposed that SPCA1 plays a role
in maintaining Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) concentrations in Golgi and the
secretory pathway.

Using RNA interference with HeLa cells, Van Baelen et al. (2003) showed
that SPCA1 was completely responsible for thapsigargin-insensitive
Ca(2+) uptake into Golgi vesicles. Knockdown of SPCA1 did not alter
Ca(2+) handling in the ER and had only a small effect on baseline
histamine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in whole cells.

Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt (2011) found that exposure of HeLa cells to
increased extracellular Mn(2+), but not Ca(2+), induced trafficking of
the Golgi phosphoprotein GPP130 (GOLIM4; 606805) from the Golgi to
multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes, followed by GPP130
degradation. They showed that a gln747-to-ala (Q747A) point mutation in
SPCA1 increased Golgi uptake of cellular Mn(2+), leading to increased
GPP130 degradation and reduced Mn(2+) toxicity via secretion. In
contrast, SPCA1 containing either an asp350-to-ala (D350A) mutation,
which blocks autophosphorylation and transport of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+), or
a gly309-to-cys (G309C) mutation, which blocks transport of Mn(2+), but
not Ca(2+), reduced Golgi uptake of Mn(2+), resulting in reduced GPP130
degradation and increased Mn(2+) toxicity.

Kourtis et al. (2012) demonstrated that heat stroke triggers pervasive
necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Preconditioning
of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protected from
heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 (140580)
and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by
preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions
with the calcium- and magnesium-transporting ATPase PMR1 to maintain
calcium homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also suppresses
cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects mammalian neurons
from heat cytotoxicity. Kourtis et al. (2012) concluded that their
findings revealed an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that defends
against diverse necrotic stimuli. In mouse cortical neurons and striatal
cells, Kourtis et al. (2012) found that overexpression of crystallin
alpha-A (123580), which colocalizes with the Golgi marker
alpha-mannosidase-II (154582) and the PMR1 ATPase, was sufficient to
protect mammalian neurons from heat stroke-induced death, even in the
absence of preconditioning. Heat stroke caused massive necrotic death
and axonal degeneration in neurons expressing short hairpin RNAs against
Pmr1, even after preconditioning.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by persistent blisters and erosions of the skin. By family
linkage studies, the HHD region was localized to 3q21-q24. Study of a
family carrying a deletion helped narrow the location. To screen HHD
patients for ATP2C1 mutations, Hu et al. (2000) identified intron sites
by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences, designed primers flanking
the 27 identified exons, and assessed PCR products from patients and
controls by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or
conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analyses. Among 51
unrelated kindreds of European descent and 10 of Japanese descent, they
identified 21 abnormalities (16/51 and 5/10). Of the abnormal sequences,
6 predicted single amino acid substitutions, 2 predicted aberrant
splicing, and 13 predicted prematurely truncated products through
frameshifts or single-basepair substitution. A high frequency of the
last type of mutation supported a haploinsufficiency pathogenesis
consistent with the complete deletion of the gene in 1 kindred and
further suggested that calcium pumps of the PMR1 family function as
monomers. The mechanism by which mutant ATPC1 causes acantholysis is
unknown, but it may be through abnormally elevated cytoplasmic calcium
or abnormally low Golgi Ca(2+) levels. Elevated cytoplasmic calcium
might act by altering posttranslational modification of proteins or by
inducing changes in gene expression.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified 13 different mutations, including
nonsense, frameshift insertion and deletions, splice-site mutations, and
nonconservative missense mutations, in ATP2C1 in patients with
Hailey-Hailey disease. The identification of ATP2A2 as the gene
defective in Darier disease (124200) provided further evidence of the
critical role of Ca(2+) signaling in maintaining epidermal integrity.

Ikeda et al. (2001) reported ATP2C1 mutations in 11 Japanese patients
with Hailey-Hailey disease. Some affected individuals had unique
clinical features (generalization of Hailey-Hailey disease and
generalized skin eruption resembling keratotic papules in Darier
disease), but other affected individuals did not, suggesting the
presence of intrafamilial phenotypic variations. These findings
reinforced the conclusion that differences in clinical phenotypes in
Hailey-Hailey disease are probably related to factors other than the
type of causative mutation.

Chao et al. (2002) identified 7 different ATP2C1 mutations, 6 of them
novel, in 7 Taiwanese kindreds with Hailey-Hailey disease. They found 3
deletion mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 1 missense mutation, and 1
splicing mutation.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2002) screened all 28 translated exons of ATP2C1 in
24 Hailey-Hailey disease families and 3 sporadic cases and identified 22
mutations (18 novel) in 25 probands. The novel mutations comprised 3
nonsense, 6 insertion/deletion, 3 splice site, and 6 missense mutations,
and were distributed throughout the ATP2C1 gene. They noted that 6 of
the mutations were found in multiple families in their study as well as
in the studies of Sudbrak et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000). Haplotype
analysis revealed that 2 of these were recurrent mutations. Comparison
between genotype and phenotype in 23 families failed to yield any clear
correlation between the nature of the mutation and clinical features of
Hailey-Hailey disease. The extensive inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic
variability suggested that modifying genes and/or environmental factors
may greatly influence the clinical features of this disease.

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease, Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation in exon 22 of the ATP2C1 gene (604384.0009).
Haplotype analysis of the more severely affected segmental skin regions
revealed consistent loss of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the
authors' hypothesis that such segmental exacerbations represent a form
of mosaicism with hemizygosity for the mutation.

insertion resulted in a frameshift with a premature termination codon 42
amino acids downstream of the mutation.

.0002
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000)
identified a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide 910 of the ATP2C1 gene,
resulting in an ala304-to-thr amino acid substitution.

In 2 unrelated families with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al.
(2000) found an identical 4-bp deletion of 2374delTTTG in the ATP2C1
gene. The 2 families had different alleles of the D3S1587 marker, a
locus less than 100 kb from the mutant gene, on the mutant chromosome.
This may indicate that these were independent mutations. The deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 10 amino acids downstream of
the mutation.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at the 3-prime end
of intron 11 (nucleotide position 852) of the ATP2C1 gene in a family
with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600). The effect on the cDNA was not
determined.

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a

Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a T-to-C
transition at nucleotide 1751 in exon 19 of the ATP2C1 gene, resulting
in a leu584-to-pro (L584P) amino acid substitution.

.0009
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS22, G-A, +1

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease (169600), originally reported by Vakilzadeh and Kolde (1985),
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the first base of the consensus splice donor site of exon
22 of the ATP2C1 gene. The mutation, which they designated 2146+1G-A,
resulted in the skipping of the 69-bp exon 22. Haplotype analysis of the
more severely affected segmental skin regions revealed consistent loss
of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the authors' hypothesis that
such segmental exacerbations represent a form of mosaicism with
hemizygosity for the mutation.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is spatially and functionally separated
from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope. All molecular transport
across the nuclear envelope takes place exclusively through the nuclear
pore. Small molecules, such as ions and polypeptides smaller than
approximately 40 kD, pass freely through the nuclear pore, but larger
molecules require a carrier protein. The nuclear pore is formed by the
nuclear pore complex (NPC), an 8-fold symmetrical structure composed of
multiple copies of about 30 different proteins called nucleoporins. The
NUP98 gene encodes a NUP98-NUP96 precursor protein that is cleaved by
its own peptidase activity to produce 2 distinct nucleoporins, NUP98 and
NUP96. Alternative splicing also generates NUP98 transcripts that encode
NUP98, but not NUP96. NUP98 is a peripheral nucleoporin located at both
the cytoplasmic and nuclear sides of the central channel of the NPC. It
contains a characteristic gly-leu-phe-gly (GFLG) repeat region that
contributes to nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking, including mRNA export.
NUP98 also plays roles in gene expression, mitotic checkpoint, and
pathogenesis. NUP96 is a scaffold component of the NPC (review by
Iwamoto et al., 2010).

CLONING

Fontoura et al. (1999) identified NUP96 as a nucleoporin with a
predicted molecular mass of 96 kD. NUP96 is generated through an unusual
biogenesis pathway that involves synthesis of a 186-kD precursor
protein. Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor yields 2 nucleoporins:
NUP98 and NUP96. NUP96 is proteolytically cleaved in vivo. NUP96 is
localized to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC at or near the
nucleoplasmic basket. The correct targeting of both NUP96 and NUP98 to
the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC was found to be dependent on
proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that the cleavage process may regulate
NPC assembly.

In their review, Iwamoto et al. (2010) noted that alternative splicing
produces 4 human NUP98 variants. Variants 1 and 4 are generated by
alternative splicing in exon 20 and are translated into the NUP98-NUP96
precursor protein. Variants 2 and 3 are generated without splicing in
exon 20 and are translated into NUP98 connected to a 57-amino acid
polypeptide tail that is removed from NUP98 by autocleavage. Variants 1
and 4 differ from one another due to alternative splicing in exon 29,
and variants 2 and 3 differ from one another due to alternative splicing
in exon 10.

MAPPING

Nakamura et al. (1996) mapped the NUP98 gene to 11p15 by analysis of a
panel of somatic cell hybrids and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunogold electron microscopy, Radu et al. (1995) localized the
NUP98 protein to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore. Nakamura et
al. (1996) stated that ligand blot analysis suggested that NUP98
functions as a docking protein for cytosol-mediated docking of import
substrates. The docking function has been localized to the N-terminal
half of NUP98, the part of NUP98 that is retained in the NUP98/HOXA9
fusion (Radu et al., 1995).

Rosenblum and Blobel (1999) determined that no protease is involved in
the processing of the NUP98-NUP96 precursor, but the molecule
specifically cleaves itself between phe863 and ser864. The 2 fragments
then form a low-affinity complex.

Von Kobbe et al. (2000) demonstrated that NUP98 is a target of the
vesicular stomatitis virus M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear
export.

Enninga et al. (2002) demonstrated that NUP98 and NUP96 are upregulated
by interferon. M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear export was
reversed when cells were treated with interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) or
transfected with a cDNA encoding NUP98 and NUP96. Enninga et al. (2002)
concluded that increased NUP98 and NUP96 expression constitutes an
IFN-mediated mechanism that reverses M protein-mediated inhibition of
gene expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Enninga et al. (2003) determined that
SEC13L1 (600152) and an N-terminal region of NUP96 interact. By mutation
analysis, they determined that the WD repeat region of SEC13L1 and
residues 201 to 378 of NUP96 were required for the interaction. SEC13L1
did not bind NUP98. During mitosis, SEC13L1 was dispersed throughout the
cell, whereas a pool of NUP96 colocalized with the spindle apparatus.

Jeganathan et al. (2005) showed that in mitosis, timely destruction of
securin (604147) by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is regulated by
the nucleocytoplasmic transport factors Rae1 (603343) and Nup98. They
showed that combined haploinsufficiency for Rae1 and Nup98 in mice
results in premature separation of sister chromatids, severe aneuploidy,
and untimely degradation of securin. They also determined that Rae1 and
Nup98 form a complex with cadherin-1 (Cdh1; 192090)-activated APC,
APC(Cdh1), in early mitosis and specifically inhibit APC(Cdh1)-mediated
ubiquitination of securin. Dissociation of Rae1 and Nup98 from APC(Cdh1)
coincides with the release of the mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1
(602860) from Cdc20 (603618)-activated APC at the metaphase to anaphase
transition. Jeganathan et al. (2005) concluded that together, their
results suggest that Rae1 and Nup98 are temporal regulators of APC(Cdh1)
that maintain euploidy by preventing unscheduled degradation of securin.

Wang et al. (2009) reported that fusing an histone H3 lysine-4
trimethylation (H3K4me3)-binding PHD finger, such as the C-terminal PHD
finger of PHF23 (612910) or JARID1A (180202), to a common fusion partner
NUP98, as identified in human leukemias (Reader et al., 2007; van Zutven
et al., 2006), generated potent oncoproteins that arrested hematopoietic
differentiation and induced acute myeloid leukemia in murine models. In
these processes, a PHD finger that specifically recognizes H3K4me3/2
marks was essential for leukemogenesis. Mutations in PHD fingers that
abrogated H3K4me3 binding also abolished leukemic transformation.
NUP98-PHD fusion prevented the differentiation-associated removal of
H3K4me3 at many loci encoding lineage-specific transcription factors
such as Hox(s) (see 142950), Gata3 (131320), Meis1 (601739), Eya1
(601653), and Pbx1 (176310), and enforced their active gene
transcription in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.
Mechanistically, NUP98-PHD fusions act as 'chromatin boundary factors,'
dominating over polycomb-mediated gene silencing to 'lock'
developmentally critical loci into an active chromatin state (H3K4me3
with induced histone acetylation), a state that defined leukemia stem
cells. Wang et al. (2009) concluded that their studies represented the
first report that deregulation of the PHD finger, an effector of
specific histone modification, perturbs the epigenetic dynamics on
developmentally critical loci, leading to catastrophic cell fate
decision making and oncogenesis during mammalian development.

Rapid disassembly of the NPC during mitotic entry requires the master
mitotic kinase CDK1 (116940) and involves phosphorylation of many
nucleoporins. Laurell et al. (2011) identified phosphorylation of NUP98
as an early and crucial step during NPC disassembly in HeLa cells.
Recombinant NUP98 was hyperphosphorylated by PLK1 (602098), NEK6
(604884), and other NEK family members in vitro. Mass spectrometric
analysis revealed that NUP98 was phosphorylated on ser591 and ser822 by
NEK6 and on thr529, thr536, ser595, ser606, and thr653 by CDK1.
Phosphomimetic mutants of NUP98 localized to the cytoplasm instead of
NPCs. Conversely, phosphodeficient NUP98 mutants significantly delayed
NPC disassembly and loss of the nuclear envelope permeability barrier.
Laurell et al. (2011) concluded that NUP98 phosphorylation is critical
for NPC disassembly at the onset of mitosis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hodel et al. (2002) reported that the 3-dimensional structure of the
C-terminal domain of NUP98 revealed a novel protein fold, and thus a new
class of autocatalytic proteases. The structure further indicated that
the nucleoporin RNA-binding motif is unlikely to bind to RNA. The C
terminus was found to contain sequences that target NUP98 to the nuclear
pore complex. Noncovalent interactions between the C-terminal domain and
the cleaved peptide tail were visible and suggested a model for
cleavage-dependent targeting of NUP98 to the nuclear pore.

CYTOGENETICS

Lam and Aplan (2001) reviewed gene fusions involving NUP98. The NUP98
gene is fused to 1 of a considerable number of other genes in various
hematologic malignancies as a consequence of chromosomal translocation.
The common theme in all NUP98 chimeras is a transcript consisting of the
5-prime part of NUP98 and the 3-prime portion of the partner gene.
However, apart from the frequent fusion to different homeobox genes,
there is no apparent similarity among the other partners.

Nakamura et al. (1996) showed that in 3 patients with t(7;11), the
chromosome rearrangement created a genomic fusion between the HOXA9 gene
(142956) and the nucleoporin gene NUP98 on 11p15. Expression of Hoxa7
and Hoxa9 is activated by proviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid
leukemias; this result, combined with the mapping of the HOXA cluster to
7p15, suggested that one of the HOXA genes may be involved in the human
t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation found in some myeloid leukemia patients.
The translocation produced an invariant chimeric NUP98/HOXA9 transcript
containing the amino terminal half of NUP98 fused in-frame to HOXA9.
These studies identified HOXA9 as an important human myeloid leukemia
gene and suggested an important role for nucleoporins in human myeloid
leukemia, given that a second nucleoporin, NUP214 (114350), had also
been implicated in human myeloid leukemia. The 11p15 gene was identified
by exon trapping experiments.

Borrow et al. (1996) likewise identified the HOXA9 and NUP98 genes as
the parents of the fusion in t(7;11)(p15;p15) in acute myeloid leukemia
of the FABM2 and M4 types. Borrow et al. (1996) suggested that the
predicted NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein may promote leukemogenesis through
inhibition of HOXA9-mediated terminal differentiation and/or aberrant
nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Hussey et al. (1999) identified the breakpoint genes of the
translocation t(4;11)(q21;p15) that occurred in a case of adult T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL). By analysis of somatic cell hybrids,
they showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint occurred within the NUP98
gene, which is rearranged in several acute myeloid leukemia
translocations. Using 3-prime RACE, Hussey et al. (1999) identified the
fusion partner of NUP98 as RAP1GDS1 (179502). This was the first report
of the involvement of RAP1GDS1 in any malignancy. The product of the
RAP1GDS1 gene, usually referred to as smgGDS, has guanine nucleotide
exchange factor activity (Mizuno et al., 1991). In the fusion
transcript, which the authors referred to as NRG, the 5-prime end of the
NUP98 gene was joined in-frame to the coding region of the RAP1GDS1
gene. This joined the FG repeat-rich region of NUP98 to RAP1GDS1, which
largely consists of tandem armadillo repeats. Hussey et al. (1999) found
that the NRG fusion maintained the reading frame of RAP1GDS1. The
RAP1GDS1 sequence in NRG started at nucleotide 5 of the coding sequence.
The methionine and the first G of the codon for aspartic acid were lost.
However, the first aspartic acid was retained in the fusion protein,
because the last base of NUP98 exon B is a G. Hussey et al. (1999)
showed that this translocation is recurrent in T-ALL.

Nakamura et al. (1999) studied a translocation fusion gene in acute
myelogenous leukemia in which the promoter of the nucleoporin gene on
11p15 was fused to the DNA-binding domain of PRRX1 (167420).

Jaju et al. (1999) identified a recurrent cryptic translocation,
t(5;11)(q35;p15.5), associated with a deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 5 in de novo childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML; see
601626). Jaju et al. (2001) confirmed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint
gene is NUP98 and cloned the chromosome 5 fusion partner, NSD1 (606681).
Nucleotide 1552 of NUP98 was fused in-frame to nucleotide 3504 of NSD1.

Constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases, such as the BCR/ABL
(151410, 189980) fusion associated with t(9;22)(q34;q22), is a hallmark
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) in humans. Expression of
BCR/ABL is both necessary and sufficient to cause a chronic
myeloproliferative syndrome in murine bone marrow transplantation
models, and depends absolutely on kinase activity. Progression of CML to
acute leukemia (blast crisis) in humans had been associated with
acquisition of secondary chromosomal translocations, including the
t(7;11)(p15;p15) resulting in the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein. Dash et
al. (2002) demonstrated that BCR/ABL cooperates with NUP98/HOXA9 to
cause blast crisis in the murine model. The phenotype depends on
expression of both BCR/ABL and NUP98/HOXA9, but tumors retain
sensitivity to the ABL inhibitor STI571 in vitro and in vivo. This
paradigm is applicable to other constitutively activated tyrosine
kinases such as TEL/PDGFRB (600618, 173410). The experiments of Dash et
al. (2002) documented cooperative effects between constitutively
activated tyrosine kinases, which confer proliferative and survival
properties to hematopoietic cells, with mutations that impair
differentiation, such as the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion, giving rise to the
acute myeloid leukemia phenotype. Furthermore, these data indicated that
despite acquisition of additional mutations, CML blast crisis cells
retain their dependence on BCR/ABL for proliferation and survival.

Rosati et al. (2002) reported a fusion between the NUP98 and NSD3
(607083) genes in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia associated with
t(8;11)(p11.2;p15). Hitherto, acute myeloid leukemia had been reported
with translocations creating chimeric genes between NUP98 and PMX1
(PRRX1), HOXD13 (142989), NSD1, HOXA9, LEDGF, DDX10 (601235), and TOP1
(126420). In patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
t(4;11)(q21;p21), fusion of the NUP98 gene to the RAP1GDS1 gene had been
observed (Hussey et al., 1999).

Arai et al. (1997) showed that the recurrent chromosome abnormality
inv(11)(p15q22), which is associated with de novo and therapy-related
myeloid malignancies, results in fusion of the nucleoporin gene NUP98
with DDX10. In DDX10 and NUP98, the inv(11) breakpoints occurred within
2 introns of each gene, and the 2 genes merged in-frame to produce the
chimeric transcripts characteristic of this translocation. Although 2
reciprocal chimeric products, NUP98-DDX10 and DDX10-NUP98, were
predicted, only NUP98-DDX10 appeared to be implicated in tumorigenesis.
DDX10 is involved in ribosome assembly, and NUP98 is a nuclear pore
complex protein and a target of other chromosomal translocations found
in AML. Arai et al. (1997) predicted the NUP98-DDX10 fusion protein may
promote leukemogenesis through aberrant nucleoplasmic transport of mRNA
or alterations in ribosome assembly.

Ahuja et al. (1999) cloned and characterized a t(11;20)(p15;q11)
translocation from patients with therapy-related AML and therapy-related
myelodysplastic syndromes. They found that the breakpoint on 11p15
targets the NUP98 gene and results in the separation of the N-terminal
FXFG repeats from the RNA-binding domain located in the C terminus. The
breakpoint on 20q11 occurred within the TOP1 gene. As a result, a
chimeric mRNA encoding the NUP98 FXFG repeats fused to the body of TOP1.
Ahuja et al. (1999) concluded that NUP98 is a recurrent target in
therapy-related malignancies and that TOP1 is a previously unrecognized
target for chromosomal translocations.

Taketani et al. (2002) found that in the t(2;11)(q31;p15) translocation
2 alternatively spliced 5-prime NUP98 transcripts were fused in-frame to
the HOXD11 gene (142986). The NUP98/HOXD fusion genes encode similar
fusion proteins, suggesting that NUP98/HOXD11 and NUP98/HOXD13 fusion
proteins play a role in leukemogenesis through similar mechanisms.

The NUP98 gene had been found at the breakpoints of several distinct
chromosomal translocations in patients with both de novo and
therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and AML. Using combined
cytogenetic and molecular analyses, Ahuja et al. (2001) found
rearrangements of the NUP98 gene in the leukemic cells of 2 patients
with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML during disease evolution.
Analysis of the t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation from 1 of the patients
showed an in-frame NUP98/HOXA9 fusion. The fusion points were similar to
those previously reported from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
or AML. The results indicated that the NUP98 gene is an additional,
albeit infrequent, genetic target during clonal evolution of CML.

Panagopoulos et al. (2003) reported a patient with de novo AML with a
t(11;12)(p15;q13) translocation resulting in a novel NUP98/HOXC13
(142976) fusion gene. FISH analyses showed a fusion signal on the
derivative chromosome 11, indicating a NUP98/HOXC chimera, whereas no
fusion was found on the derivative chromosome 12, suggesting that the
reciprocal fusion gene was deleted. Thus, NUP98/HOXC13 is of
pathogenetic importance in t(11;12)-positive AML.

Lahortiga et al. (2003) noted that the NUP98 gene had been reported to
be fused to 13 partner genes in hematologic malignancies with 11p15
translocations. Twelve of the 13 had been identified in patients with
myeloid neoplasias and only 1, RAP1GDS1, was fused with NUP98 in 5
patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Three of these
patients coexpressed T cell and myeloid markers, suggesting a specific
association of RAP1GDS1 fusion with a subset of T-ALL originated from an
early progenitor, which has a potential to express mature T-cell
antigens as well as myeloid markers. Lahortiga et al. (2003) described a
new NUP98 partner involved in a t(10;11)(q25;p15) in a patient with
acute biphenotypic leukemia, showing coexpression of mature T cell and
myeloid markers. The gene involved, located at 10q25, was identified as
adducin-3 (ADD3; 601568) using 3-prime RACE. ADD3 codes for the
ubiquitously expressed subunit gamma of the adducin protein and it seems
to play an important role in the skeletal organization of the cell
membrane. Both NUP98/ADD3 and ADD3/NUP98 fusion transcription were
expressed in the patient. Adducin shares with the product of RAP1GDS1,
and with all of the nonhomeobox NUP98 partners, the presence of a region
with significant probability of adopting a coiled-coil conformation.
This region is always retained in the fusion transcript with the NH2
terminus FG repeats of NUP98, suggesting an important role in the
mechanism of leukemogenesis.

Panagopoulos et al. (2006) reported the case of a fourth NUP98 chimera
in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; a t(11;18)(p15;q12) resulted in
a novel NUP98 fusion. They found that exon 12 of NUP98 was fused
in-frame with exon 5 SETBP1. Nested PCR did not amplify the reciprocal
SETBP1/NUP98, suggesting that the NUP98/SETBP1 transcript is
pathogenetically important.

In a 42-year-old man with AML, Reader et al. (2007) identified a cryptic
translocation, t(11;17)(p15;p13), that resulted in in-frame fusion of
exon 13 of NUP98 to exon 4 of PHF23 (612910). The deduced chimeric
protein contains the N-terminal half of NUP98 fused to the C-terminal
functional domains of PHF23.

Such et al. (2011) identified a NUP98/RARG (180190) fusion gene
resulting from a t(11;12)(p15;p13) translocation in bone marrow cells
derived from a 35-year-old man with AML that had morphologic and
immunophenotypic features of the hypergranular subtype of acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376). Sequence analysis determined that
NUP98 exon 12 was fused in-frame to RARG exon 4, predicted to encode an
862-residue protein with aberrant RARG receptor function. The patient
was treated with standard chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation;
response to ATRA was not assessed.

Tosi et al. (2005) identified a translocation, t(6;11)(q24.1;p15.5), in
a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. RT-PCR and sequencing
revealed a transcript that contained exon 13 of NUP98 fused in-frame
with exon 2 of C6ORF80 (CCDC28A; 615353). The reciprocal fusion
transcript was not detected.

Petit et al. (2012) found that the NUP98-CCDC28A transcript contains
1,833 nucleotides of NUP98 fused in-frame to nucleotide 384 of CDCD28A.
The resultant 712-amino acid protein contains the N-terminal
transactivating GLFG repeats of NUP98 fused to CCDC28A beginning at
amino acid 77 and including its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The
fusion protein was expressed in the nucleus following transfection of
primary mouse bone marrow cells. Immortalized mouse cells expressing
human NUP98-CCDC28A exhibited myeloblast morphology, proliferated in a
cytokine-independent manner, and caused fatal myeloproliferative
neoplasms in transplanted mice, with selective expansion of
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in bone marrow.

ANIMAL MODEL

Iwasaki et al. (2005) generated transgenic mice in which the NUP98/HOXA9
fusion gene was specifically expressed in the myeloid lineage under the
control of the cathepsin G promoter. Approximately 20% of the transgenic
mice developed acute myeloid leukemia after a long latency period. When
NUP98/HOXA9 was introduced into the sensitive BXH2 mouse strain, it
promoted onset of retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemia. By examining
common retrovirus integration sites in these mice, Iwasaki et al. (2005)
found that Meis1 (601739), Dnalc4 (610565), Fcgr2b (604590), Fcrl
(606891), and Con1 cooperated with NUP98/HOXA9 in promoting the
development of myeloid leukemias. Using a transformation assay with
mouse NIH3T3 cells, Iwasaki et al. (2005) confirmed that these genes
cooperated with NUP98/HOXA9 in inducing the transformed phenotype,
although none alone were transforming.

603889	TITLE *603889 SIGNAL REGULATORY PROTEIN, BETA-1; SIRPB1
DESCRIPTION Signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulates the growth
of many cell types. The transmembrane protein SIRP-alpha-1 (602461) is a
substrate of activated RTKs and binds to SH2 domains. Kharitonenkov et
al. (1997) defined 2 subfamilies of SIRPs (signal regulatory proteins).
Members of the SIRP-alpha subfamily have a cytoplasmic SHP2-binding
domain; members of the SIRP-beta subfamily lack this cytoplasmic tail.
Kharitonenkov et al. (1997) cloned 4 homologous SIRP genes. The
SIRP-beta-1 gene encodes a 398-amino acid polypeptide which lacks the
C-terminal SHP2-binding cytoplasmic domain.

114090	TITLE *114090 CALPASTATIN; CAST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calpastatin is an endogenous inhibitor of calpains (see 114170)
consisting of 4 inhibitory repeats, each of which neutralizes an
activated calpain. Unlike proteinases, it is an intrinsically
unstructured protein, adopting a defined structure only upon binding to
active calpain ().

GENE FUNCTION

In erythrocytes of patients with essential hypertension (see 145500),
the level of calpastatin activity is significantly lower than in the red
cells of normotensive subjects. Pontremoli et al. (1988) demonstrated by
Western blot analysis that the decreased inhibitor activity is the
result of a decrease in the amount of the inhibitor protein. Calpastatin
isolated and purified from erythrocytes of normotensive and hypertensive
patients had identical specific activities. Pontremoli et al. (1988)
also presented evidence indicating that the decreased level of
calpastatin cannot be ascribed to accelerated decay during the red cell
life span.

Mimori et al. (1995) demonstrated that anti-calpastatin autoantibodies
are present in as many as 57% of rheumatoid arthritis patients and
concluded that they may participate in pathogenic mechanisms of this and
other rheumatic diseases which showed a lower frequency.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe encoding the 5-prime terminal region of CAST for
spot-blot analysis of sorted chromosomes and chromosomal in situ
hybridization, Inazawa et al. (1990) assigned the CAST gene to 5q14-q22.
Inazawa et al. (1991) mapped CAST to 5q15-q21 by 2 methods of in situ
hybridization and confirmed the results by spot-blot analysis of sorted
chromosomes.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Moldoveanu et al. (2008) reported the 3.0-angstrom crystal structure of
calcium-bound m-calpain (CAPN2; 114230) in complex with the first
calpastatin repeat, both from rat, revealing the mechanism of exclusive
specificity. The structure highlighted the complexity of calpain
activation by calcium, illustrating key residues in a peripheral domain
that serve to stabilize the protease core on calcium binding. Fully
activated calpain binds 10 Ca(2+) atoms, resulting in several
conformational changes allowing recognition by calpastatin. Calpain
inhibition is mediated by the intimate contact with 3 critical regions
of calpastatin. Two regions target the penta-EF-hand domains of calpain,
and the third occupies the substrate-binding cleft, projecting a loop
around the active site thiol to evade proteolysis.

Hanna et al. (2008) reported the 2.4-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of the calcium-bound calpain-2 (m-calpain) heterodimer bound
by 1 of the 4 inhibitory domains of calpastatin. They observed that
calpastatin inhibits calpain by occupying both sides of the active site
cleft. Although the inhibitor passes through the active site cleft it
escapes cleavage in a novel manner by looping out and around the active
site cysteine. The inhibitory domain of calpastatin recognizes multiple
lower affinity sites present only in the calcium-bound form of the
enzyme, resulting in an interaction that is tight, specific, and
calcium-dependent. Hanna et al. (2008) concluded that this crystal
structure, and that of the related complex described by Moldoveanu et
al. (2008), also revealed the conformational changes that calpain
undergoes on binding calcium, which include opening of the active site
cleft and movement of the domains relative to each other to produce a
more compact enzyme.

ANIMAL MODEL

Reduced sarcolemmal integrity in dystrophin (300377)-deficient muscles
of mdx mice and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200) patients had
been reported to result in altered calcium homeostasis. Previous studies
had shown a correlative relationship between calpain activity in
dystrophic muscle and muscle necrosis, but had not tested whether
calpain activation precedes cell death or is a consequence of it.
Spencer and Mellgren (2002) generated mdx mice that overexpressed a
calpastatin transgene in muscle. Normal-appearing transgenic mice
overexpressing calpastatin were crossed with mdx mice. Two lines of mice
were examined, with different levels of calpastatin overexpression. Both
lines of transgenic/mdx mice showed reductions in muscle necrosis at 4
weeks of age. The extent of improvement correlated with the level of
calpastatin protein expression. Membrane damage, as assessed by procion
orange and creatine kinase assays, was unchanged, supporting the idea
that calpains act downstream of the primary muscle defect. The authors
hypothesized that calpains may play an active role in necrotic processes
in dystrophic muscle, and that inhibition of calpains might provide a
therapeutic option for treatment of DMD.

607021	TITLE *607021 SEIZURE-RELATED 6-LIKE; SEZ6L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Allelic losses on 22q are frequently found in small cell lung carcinomas
(SCLCs) and advanced non-small cell lung carcinomas, indicating the
presence of tumor suppressor gene(s) on that chromosome arm. In an SCLC
cell line, Nishioka et al. (2000) detected a homozygous deletion at
22q12.1. Cloning of the breakpoints revealed that the deletion was
interstitial and was 428,131 bp in size. The deleted region contained
the SEZ6L (seizure 6-like) gene, whose structure had been partially
determined by the chromosome 22 sequencing project (Dunham et al.,
1999). The SEZ6L cDNA contains a 3,072-bp open reading frame encoding a
1,024-amino acid transmembrane protein with multiple domains involved in
protein-protein interaction and signal transduction. SEZ6L expression
was detected in a variety of human tissues, including lung, while its
expression was detected in 14 (30%) of 46 lung cancer cell lines
examined. Missense mutations were detected in 3 (7%) of 46 cell lines,
and a 1-bp deletion in the polypyrimidine tract preceding exon 4 was
detected in 1 (2%) of 46 primary lung cancers. Therefore, Nishioka et
al. (2000) considered it possible that genetic and/or epigenetic SEZ6L
alterations are involved in the development and/or progression in a
subset of lung cancer, although functional analysis of the SEZ6L gene as
well as molecular analysis of other genes in the homozygously deleted
region would be necessary in order to understand the pathogenetic
significance of 22q deletions in human lung carcinogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishioka et al. (2000) concluded that the SEZ6L gene consists of 17
exons within a 210-kb region.

MAPPING

Nishioka et al. (2000) identified the SEZ6L gene within a deletion at
chromosome 22q12.1.

GENE FUNCTION

SEZ6L was one of the genes studied by Suzuki et al. (2002) in a
microarray genome screen for genes upregulated by demethylation and
histone deacetylase inhibition in human colorectal cancer.

615187	TITLE *615187 POST-GPI ATTACHMENT TO PROTEINS 2; PGAP2
;;FGF RECEPTOR-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1; FRAG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification of plasma membrane
proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and GPI-anchored
proteins are incorporated into rafts in the Golgi during their transport
to the cell surface. PGAP2 appears to be involved in maturation of the
GPI anchor on GPI-anchored proteins (Tashima et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening an M426 human embryonic fibroblast cell line with rat
Frag1, Lorenzi et al. (1999) cloned PGAP2, which they called FRAG1. The
deduced 316-amino acid protein has 2 N-terminal FRAG1 homology (FH)
domains and 4 possible isoprenylation signals. Hydropathy analysis
suggested that FRAG1 has 7 transmembrane segments. Human and rat FRAG1
share 92% amino acid identity, but the rat protein has only 1 FH domain.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 2.0-kb FRAG1
transcript in all 16 tissues examined, with highest expression in testis
and pancreas, and lowest expression in brain and thymus. A transcript of
about 3.2 kb was also detected in several tissues, predominantly
pancreas, spleen, and prostate. FRAG1 was also detected in a number of
tumor cell lines at a level comparable to that observed in normal
tissues.

By database analysis and cloning using rat and hamster cDNA libraries,
Tashima et al. (2006) identified human, rat, and hamster cDNAs encoding
a 254-amino acid PGAP2 protein. They also identified a splice variant in
human and hamster that encodes a 250-amino acid isoform lacking a VSQE
sequence. Rat Pgap2 localized to Golgi in transfected NRK cells.

Hansen et al. (2013) stated that the PGAP2 gene encodes 16 different RNA
transcripts, 8 of which encode different isoforms and 8 that are
noncoding RNA. Isoform 8, which is 254 amino acids long and contains 5
alpha-helix domains embedded in the Golgi membrane, is believed to be
the biologically active isoform. The N terminus is in the cytoplasm and
the C terminus is in the Golgi lumen.

GENE FUNCTION

Tashima et al. (2006) found that transfected CHO cells lacking Pgap2
were deficient in cell surface expression of the human GPI-anchored
proteins CD59 (107271) and CD55 (125240). Cotransfection of rat Pgap2 or
the human or hamster variant encoding the short PGAP2 isoform restored
CD59 surface expression. GPI-anchored proteins appeared to traffic
normally through the ER and Golgi, but they were secreted upon arrival
at the plasma membrane via phospholipid D (see 602382)-like activity.
The secreted proteins showed an altered GPI anchor. Tashima et al.
(2006) proposed that remodeling of the GPI anchor occurs in GPI-anchored
proteins, and that in Pgap2-deficient cells, this remodeling is
defective, resulting in GPI-anchored proteins that are sensitive to
cleavage then secretion from the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lorenzi et al. (1999) determined that the PGAP2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans over 7 kb. The tandem FH domains in the FRAG1 protein are
encoded by exons 1 and 2.

MAPPING

Using FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Lorenzi et al. (1999) mapped
the PGAP2 gene to chromosome 11p15.5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous families with
hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome-3 (HPMRS3; 614207),
Hansen et al. (2013) identified 2 different homozygous missense
mutations in the PGAP2 gene (615187.0001 and 615187.0002, respectively).
In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant alleles
were hypomorphic and caused decreased enzyme activity. Hansen et al.
(2013) commented that the disorder due to PGAP2 mutations can be viewed
as part of a disease family representing a spectrum of disorders due to
mutations in genes involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor
biosynthesis. Mutations in genes earlier in the pathway appear to cause
a more severe phenotype, including dysmorphic features (e.g., MCAHS1,
614080), than mutations in genes that act later in the pathway.

Among 13 individuals with intellectual disability and increased serum
alkaline phosphatase who were screened for mutations in genes encoding
proteins in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway, Krawitz et al. (2013)
found that 2 unrelated patients carried biallelic missense mutations in
the PGAP2 gene (615187.0003-615187.0005). In vitro studies showed that
the mutations caused decreased enzyme activity.

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Syrian family (MR043) with
autosomal recessive hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation-3 (HPMRS3;
614207) originally reported by Abou Jamra et al. (2011), Hansen et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous c.296A-G transition in the PGAP2 gene,
resulting in a tyr99-to-cys (Y99C) substitution between transmembrane
segments 1 and 2 in the Golgi lumen. The mutation, which was found by
exome sequencing of the linked region on chromosome 11p15, was confirmed
by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family. In
vitro functional expression studies in CHO cells showed that the mutant
protein was expressed but had significantly decreased activity compared
to wildtype. Patient lymphoblastoid cells showed essentially normal
expression of the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (125240) and CD59 (107271),
supporting a hypomorphic effect of the Y99C mutation.

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family (MR5) with

al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.530G-C transversion in the PGAP2
gene, resulting in an arg177-to-pro (R177P) substitution between
transmembrane segments 3 and 4 in the Golgi lumen. The mutation, which
was found by exome sequencing of the linked region on chromosome 11p15,
was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the disorder in
the family. In vitro functional expression studies in CHO cells showed
that the mutant protein was expressed but had significantly decreased
activity compared to wildtype. Patient lymphoblastoid cells showed
essentially normal expression of the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (125240)
and CD59 (107271), supporting a hypomorphic effect of the R177P
mutation.

Krawitz et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.380T-C transition in the
PGAP2 gene, resulting in a leu127-to-ser (L127S) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation segregated with the disorder in
the family. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had decreased activity compared to wildtype.

.0004
HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 3
PGAP2, ARG16TRP

In a 28-year-old Finnish woman with mild HPMRS3 (614207), Krawitz et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PGAP2
gene: a c.46C-T transition resulting in an arg16-to-trp (R16W)
substitution, and a c.479C-T transition resulting in a thr160-to-ile
(T160I; 615187.0005) substitution. Both mutations occurred at highly
conserved residues. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the mutant proteins had decreased activity compared to wildtype. Higher
residual activity of R16W may explain the milder phenotype in this
patient.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP2C1 is a Golgi-localized ATPase that mediates Golgi uptake of
cytosolic Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and has a role in regulating Ca(2+) and
Mn(2+) cellular content (Ton et al., 2002).

CLONING

Hu et al. (2000) identified an EST corresponding to the ATP2C1 gene
within a 1.3-Mb YAC/BAC contig spanning the region of chromosome
3q21-q24 deleted in a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600).
This EST had been annotated as homologous to a yeast gene encoding a
calcium ATPase with a function predicted to be related to that of SERCA2
(ATP2A2; 108740). Hu et al. (2000) isolated the full-length cDNA
corresponding to the human EST. Similar to other Ca(2+) ATPase genes,
the ATP2C1 gene encodes 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, ATP2C1a and
ATP2C1b. These transcripts differed in their C termini (encoding amino
acids 877 to the end), but had the same expression patterns in all
tissues examined. ATP2C1a was predicted to encode 919 amino acids, and
ATP2C1b was predicted to encode 888 amino acids. The protein encoded by
ATP2C1 was highly homologous (97% identity) to rat Pmr1, which in turn
is homologous to the yeast calcium pump Pmr1, but less homologous to
other calcium pumps. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb ATP2C1
transcript in keratinocytes and in all 12 whole tissues examined.
Highest expression was in kidney and heart, and lowest expression was in
colon, thymus, and leukocytes. Patients with HHD are not known to have
extracutaneous manifestations of the disease. Hu et al. (2000) found no
differences in ATP2C1 mRNA levels between skin taken from the axilla and
skin from the buttock (sites particularly prone vs resistant to
blistering, respectively, in HHD patients) of one normal individual and
little change in ATP2C1 mRNA levels in normal human epidermal
keratinocytes cultured with glucocorticoid.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ATP2C1 clone, which they designated
KIAA1347. The deduced 918-amino acid protein shares 97% identity with
its rat ortholog, a calcium-transporting ATPase. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ATP2C1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary, followed by lung, testis, brain, liver, and
kidney. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression was
detected in thalamus, followed by amygdala and substantia nigra.

Ton et al. (2002) showed that epitope-tagged human SPCA1 localized to
the Golgi compartment following expression in yeast and Chinese hamster
ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2000) detected 27 exons in the ATP2C1 gene. Dobson-Stone et
al. (2002) detected 28 translated exons.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1
gene to chromosome 3. Hu et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Pmr1, the yeast ortholog of SPCA1, is expressed in the Golgi compartment
and functions as a high-affinity Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) pump involved in Ca(2+)
and Mn(2+) secretion. Deletion of Pmr1 in yeast causes hypersensitivity
to Ca(2+) chelators and Mn(2+) toxicity, with defects in protein
glycosylation, processing, sorting, and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-related glycosylation. Ton et al. (2002) found that heterologous
expression of human SPCA1, but not SERCA-type Ca(2+)-transporting
ATPases, reduced Mn(2+) toxicity and complemented Ca(2+)-related
phenotypes in Pmr1-null yeast. Yeast Golgi vesicles expressing human
SPCA1 showed high-affinity Ca(2+) transport activity that was
inhibitable by Mn(2+), but not by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of
SERCA-type ATPases. Ton et al. (2002) proposed that SPCA1 plays a role
in maintaining Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) concentrations in Golgi and the
secretory pathway.

Using RNA interference with HeLa cells, Van Baelen et al. (2003) showed
that SPCA1 was completely responsible for thapsigargin-insensitive
Ca(2+) uptake into Golgi vesicles. Knockdown of SPCA1 did not alter
Ca(2+) handling in the ER and had only a small effect on baseline
histamine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in whole cells.

Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt (2011) found that exposure of HeLa cells to
increased extracellular Mn(2+), but not Ca(2+), induced trafficking of
the Golgi phosphoprotein GPP130 (GOLIM4; 606805) from the Golgi to
multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes, followed by GPP130
degradation. They showed that a gln747-to-ala (Q747A) point mutation in
SPCA1 increased Golgi uptake of cellular Mn(2+), leading to increased
GPP130 degradation and reduced Mn(2+) toxicity via secretion. In
contrast, SPCA1 containing either an asp350-to-ala (D350A) mutation,
which blocks autophosphorylation and transport of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+), or
a gly309-to-cys (G309C) mutation, which blocks transport of Mn(2+), but
not Ca(2+), reduced Golgi uptake of Mn(2+), resulting in reduced GPP130
degradation and increased Mn(2+) toxicity.

Kourtis et al. (2012) demonstrated that heat stroke triggers pervasive
necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Preconditioning
of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protected from
heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 (140580)
and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by
preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions
with the calcium- and magnesium-transporting ATPase PMR1 to maintain
calcium homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also suppresses
cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects mammalian neurons
from heat cytotoxicity. Kourtis et al. (2012) concluded that their
findings revealed an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that defends
against diverse necrotic stimuli. In mouse cortical neurons and striatal
cells, Kourtis et al. (2012) found that overexpression of crystallin
alpha-A (123580), which colocalizes with the Golgi marker
alpha-mannosidase-II (154582) and the PMR1 ATPase, was sufficient to
protect mammalian neurons from heat stroke-induced death, even in the
absence of preconditioning. Heat stroke caused massive necrotic death
and axonal degeneration in neurons expressing short hairpin RNAs against
Pmr1, even after preconditioning.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by persistent blisters and erosions of the skin. By family
linkage studies, the HHD region was localized to 3q21-q24. Study of a
family carrying a deletion helped narrow the location. To screen HHD
patients for ATP2C1 mutations, Hu et al. (2000) identified intron sites
by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences, designed primers flanking
the 27 identified exons, and assessed PCR products from patients and
controls by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or
conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analyses. Among 51
unrelated kindreds of European descent and 10 of Japanese descent, they
identified 21 abnormalities (16/51 and 5/10). Of the abnormal sequences,
6 predicted single amino acid substitutions, 2 predicted aberrant
splicing, and 13 predicted prematurely truncated products through
frameshifts or single-basepair substitution. A high frequency of the
last type of mutation supported a haploinsufficiency pathogenesis
consistent with the complete deletion of the gene in 1 kindred and
further suggested that calcium pumps of the PMR1 family function as
monomers. The mechanism by which mutant ATPC1 causes acantholysis is
unknown, but it may be through abnormally elevated cytoplasmic calcium
or abnormally low Golgi Ca(2+) levels. Elevated cytoplasmic calcium
might act by altering posttranslational modification of proteins or by
inducing changes in gene expression.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified 13 different mutations, including
nonsense, frameshift insertion and deletions, splice-site mutations, and
nonconservative missense mutations, in ATP2C1 in patients with
Hailey-Hailey disease. The identification of ATP2A2 as the gene
defective in Darier disease (124200) provided further evidence of the
critical role of Ca(2+) signaling in maintaining epidermal integrity.

Ikeda et al. (2001) reported ATP2C1 mutations in 11 Japanese patients
with Hailey-Hailey disease. Some affected individuals had unique
clinical features (generalization of Hailey-Hailey disease and
generalized skin eruption resembling keratotic papules in Darier
disease), but other affected individuals did not, suggesting the
presence of intrafamilial phenotypic variations. These findings
reinforced the conclusion that differences in clinical phenotypes in
Hailey-Hailey disease are probably related to factors other than the
type of causative mutation.

Chao et al. (2002) identified 7 different ATP2C1 mutations, 6 of them
novel, in 7 Taiwanese kindreds with Hailey-Hailey disease. They found 3
deletion mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 1 missense mutation, and 1
splicing mutation.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2002) screened all 28 translated exons of ATP2C1 in
24 Hailey-Hailey disease families and 3 sporadic cases and identified 22
mutations (18 novel) in 25 probands. The novel mutations comprised 3
nonsense, 6 insertion/deletion, 3 splice site, and 6 missense mutations,
and were distributed throughout the ATP2C1 gene. They noted that 6 of
the mutations were found in multiple families in their study as well as
in the studies of Sudbrak et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000). Haplotype
analysis revealed that 2 of these were recurrent mutations. Comparison
between genotype and phenotype in 23 families failed to yield any clear
correlation between the nature of the mutation and clinical features of
Hailey-Hailey disease. The extensive inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic
variability suggested that modifying genes and/or environmental factors
may greatly influence the clinical features of this disease.

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease, Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation in exon 22 of the ATP2C1 gene (604384.0009).
Haplotype analysis of the more severely affected segmental skin regions
revealed consistent loss of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the
authors' hypothesis that such segmental exacerbations represent a form
of mosaicism with hemizygosity for the mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 4-BP INS, 767CCCT

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000) found
a 4-bp insertion after nucleotide 767 in exon 10 of the ATP2C1 gene. The
insertion resulted in a frameshift with a premature termination codon 42
amino acids downstream of the mutation.

.0002
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ALA304THR

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000)
identified a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide 910 of the ATP2C1 gene,
resulting in an ala304-to-thr amino acid substitution.

.0003
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ARG468TER

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000) found
a 1402C-T transition in the ATP2C1 gene that altered codon 468 from
arginine to stop.

.0004
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 4-BP DEL, 2374TTTG

In 2 unrelated families with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al.
(2000) found an identical 4-bp deletion of 2374delTTTG in the ATP2C1
gene. The 2 families had different alleles of the D3S1587 marker, a
locus less than 100 kb from the mutant gene, on the mutant chromosome.
This may indicate that these were independent mutations. The deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 10 amino acids downstream of
the mutation.

.0005
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS11, G-A, -1

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at the 3-prime end
of intron 11 (nucleotide position 852) of the ATP2C1 gene in a family
with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600). The effect on the cDNA was not
determined.

.0006
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, CYS490PHE

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a
cys490-to-phe (C490F) amino acid substitution that arose from a 1469G-T
transversion in exon 17 of the ATP2C1 gene.

.0007
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 1-BP DEL, 2460G

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a
frameshift mutation in the ATP2C1 gene, 2460delG, that resulted in a
premature termination codon at exon 25.

.0008
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, LEU584PRO

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a T-to-C
transition at nucleotide 1751 in exon 19 of the ATP2C1 gene, resulting
in a leu584-to-pro (L584P) amino acid substitution.

.0009
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS22, G-A, +1

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease (169600), originally reported by Vakilzadeh and Kolde (1985),
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the first base of the consensus splice donor site of exon
22 of the ATP2C1 gene. The mutation, which they designated 2146+1G-A,
resulted in the skipping of the 69-bp exon 22. Haplotype analysis of the
more severely affected segmental skin regions revealed consistent loss
of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the authors' hypothesis that
such segmental exacerbations represent a form of mosaicism with
hemizygosity for the mutation.
