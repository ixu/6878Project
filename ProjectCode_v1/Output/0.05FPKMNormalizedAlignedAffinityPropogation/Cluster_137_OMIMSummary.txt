602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

611030	TITLE *611030 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 30C; TMEM30C
;;CDC50, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, C; CDC50C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of yeast Cdc50 family proteins,
which are involved in polarized cell division, Katoh and Katoh (2004)
identified 3 human CDC50 genes, including TMEM30C, which they called
CDC50C. The predicted CDC50C protein contains 341 amino acids. The human
and yeast CDC50 proteins all have 2 transmembrane domains and an
extracellular loop with 3 cysteines and an N-glycosylation site.

Osada et al. (2007) obtained TMEM30C cDNAs by 3-prime RACE of human and
chimpanzee testis RNA. In both species, the TMEM30C transcripts were
truncated due to mutations in splicing or poly(A) signals relative to
the macaque gene, which encodes 2 splice variants derived from 7 or 8
exons that produce proteins with 1 or 2 transmembrane domains,
respectively. In contrast, the major human transcript originates from 3
exons and lacks a stop codon, suggesting it does not produce a
functional protein. A minor human transcript transcribed from 2 exons
encodes a predicted 113-amino acid protein with 1 transmembrane domain.
RT-PCR showed that TMEM30C was expressed exclusively in testis of human,
macaque, and mouse. Expression of exons 5 through 8 in human and exons 6
through 8 in chimpanzee was not detected, suggesting that the
2-transmembrane form of TMEM30C is dispensable in hominoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the TMEM30C gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the TMEM30C
gene to chromosome 3q12.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Osada et al. (2007) showed that an accelerated
rate of amino acid substitutions in TMEM30C occurred after the
divergence of chimps and humans from Old World monkeys. They suggested
that the excess of substitutions might result from positive selection
for a new function or, more likely, relaxation of selection, as occurs
in pseudogenes.

;;PROTEASOME ACTIVATOR 28-GAMMA; PA28G;;
PA28-GAMMA;;

KI ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PSME3 belongs to the proteasome activator subunit (PSME) gene family.
For background information on the PSME gene family, see PSME1 (600654).

CLONING

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) produce
autoantibodies against a number of nuclear antigens, including SNRP70
(180740), PCNA (176740), CDR1 (302650), and Ki. By screening a human
placenta cDNA library with a probe obtained by screening a bovine retina
cDNA library with anti-Ki sera from an SLE patient, Nikaido et al.
(1990) isolated a cDNA encoding PSME3, which they called Ki. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 254-amino acid, hydrophilic PSME3 protein
contains a nuclear localization signal and has a molecular mass of
approximately 30 kD, close to the 32 kD observed by Western blot
analysis. PSME3 shares over 99% amino acid identity with the bovine
sequence. RNA blot analysis of human placenta, bovine brain, and mouse
embryos detected 3.0- and 1.5-kb PSME3 transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC3, or NCOA3; 601937) is an oncogene
frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis, Li et al. (2006) found that endogenous
SRC3 and REG-gamma interacted in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and MCF-7
breast cancer cells. Protein pull-down assays showed the REG-gamma
interacted specifically with the HAT domain of SRC3. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNA interference (RNAi) in breast cancer and human
embryonic kidney cell lines resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in SRC3
protein levels. Conversely, REG-gamma overexpression in HeLa cells
reduced SRC3 protein levels. In vitro proteasome assays using purified
proteins showed that REG-gamma promoted degradation of SRC3 by the 20S
proteasome in a ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNAi increased estrogen receptor (ER; see 133430) target
gene expression and enhanced estradiol-mediated cell growth in MCF-7
cells, and these effects were secondary to the effect of REG-gamma on
SRC3.

MAPPING

By analysis of overlapping YAC contigs and by FISH, Albertsen et al.
(1994) mapped the PSME3 gene to 17q12-q21. Kandil et al. (1997) mapped
the mouse Psme3 gene to chromosome 14 using interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barton et al. (2004) found that mice lacking Psme3 had normal levels of
surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules,
slightly reduced Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, and normal responses
to infection with influenza or SV40 virus. However, the ability of Psme3
-/- mice to clear the pulmonary fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum
was slower than wildtype mice. Barton et al. (2004) proposed that PSME3
functions in the MHC class I antigen-processing pathway and that it
exerts an influence on proteasome cleavage specificity.

DESCRIPTION Receptors for the Fc region (FcRs) of immunoglobulins (Igs) modulate
cellular and humoral immunity by linking their antibody ligands with
effector cells of the immune system. FcRs sense humoral concentrations
of antibody, initiate cellular responses in host defense, and
participate in autoimmune disorders.

CLONING

By EST database searching for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
motif (ITIM)-bearing receptor proteins, Xu et al. (2001) identified a
cDNA encoding SPAP1A (SH2 domain-containing phosphatase anchor
protein-1A). The deduced 255-amino acid transmembrane protein contains 2
ITIMs. Further searches and sequencing identified a 192-amino acid
splice variant, SPAP1B, lacking the intracellular ITIMs, and a 144-amino
acid isoform, SPAP1C, lacking the transmembrane segment. RT-PCR analysis
detected SPAP1A expression in spleen, peripheral blood, bone marrow, and
B-cell lines, but not in other tissues. SPAP1C was also detected in
Jurkat and B-cell lines but SPAP1B was not detected in any samples
tested. Western blot analysis showed expression of SPAP1A as a 38- and
40-kD doublet protein reduced to 32 kD or 28 kD by N-glycosidase or
O-glycosidase treatment, respectively. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that SPAP1A ITIMs recruit the SHP1 (PTPN6; 176883), but not the SHP2
(PTPN11; 176876), tyrosine phosphatase, a major negative regulator of
hematopoietic cell signaling.

By database searching using a consensus sequence corresponding to the
second Ig-like domains of FCGR1A (146760), FCGR2A (146790), and FCGR3A
(146740) as well as the third Ig-like domain of the polymeric Ig
receptor (PIGR; 173880), Davis et al. (2001) identified 2 BAC clones
located at chromosome 1q21.1-q22. They found that one of these clones
contained 3 novel putative Ig superfamily genes, which they designated
FCRH1 (606508), FCRH2, and FCRH3 (606510), as well as 2 previously
identified members of this family, FCRH4 (IRTA1; 605876) and FCRH5
(IRTA2; 605877). Sequence analysis predicted that the 508-amino acid
type I transmembrane protein possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, 4
extracellular C2 type Ig-like domains, 5 N-linked glycosylation sites,
an uncharged transmembrane segment, and an 86-amino acid cytoplasmic
tail with 1 ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and 2
ITIMs. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of approximately 3.0-,
4.4- and 5.5-kb transcripts chiefly in spleen and lymph nodes and a
2.4-kb transcript in kidney. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in
mature B-cell lines. Davis et al. (2001) suggested that FCRH2 may have
an activating/inhibitory or a fine-tuning role in regulation of
immunologic function.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) determined that the
FCRH2 gene contains 12 exons that span approximately 30 kb.

MAPPING

By BAC and genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) mapped the
FCRH2 gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q22, near the classic FCGR loci.
