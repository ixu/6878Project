604249	TITLE *604249 RETICULON 3; RTN3
;;NEUROENDOCRINE-SPECIFIC PROTEIN-LIKE 2; NSPL2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The reticulons are a group of highly conserved genes with preferential
expression in neuroendocrine tissues (see, e.g., RTN1; 600865).

CLONING

During a subtraction cloning between macula and peripheral retina,
Moreira et al. (1999) isolated a novel member of the reticulon gene
family, which they designated reticulon-3. The mRNA for RTN3 was
approximately 3-fold more abundant in macula than in peripheral retina.
The 2,527-bp cDNA encodes a predicted 236-amino acid protein that shows
strong sequence similarity with other members of the RTN gene family
(see, e.g., 600865). Northern blot analysis showed that RTN3 is widely
expressed in human tissues, with highest expression in the brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moreira et al. (1999) determined that the RTN3 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 15 kb.

MAPPING

By use of somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid panels, Moreira et
al. (1999) mapped the RTN3 gene to 11q13, between markers D11S4535 and
D11S4627. Southern blot analysis identified the presence of at least one
pseudogene that was subsequently localized to chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2004) found that BACE1 (604252) coimmunoprecipitated with
members of the reticulon family of proteins: RTN1, RTN2 (603183), RTN3,
and RTN4 (604475). BACE1 colocalized with RTN3 in neurons of human brain
gray matter, and with RTN4 in oligodendrocytes in white matter.
Overexpression of RTN3 in vitro inhibited BACE1 activity and decreased
amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) processing. The findings
suggested that reticulon proteins are negative modulators of BACE1
activity, and that RTN3 specifically blocks access of BACE1 to APP
within neurons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Windpassinger et al. (2003) excluded RTN3 as the gene mutant in Silver
spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685), the locus for which maps to
11q12-q14, as no mutations in RTN3 were found on sequence analysis of at
least 2 affected individuals from each of 4 different families and 1
healthy control.

608082	TITLE *608082 YIPPEE-LIKE 1; YPEL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Farlie et al. (2001) cloned mouse Ypel1 from an embryonic day-10.5
branchial arch cDNA library. The deduced 118-amino acid protein contains
a putative nuclear localization signal and has a calculated molecular
mass of about 13.5 kD. By database analysis, they identified human
YPEL1, which encodes a deduced 119-amino acid protein that shares 99.2%
identity with mouse Ypel1. YPEL1 is highly homologous to Yippee, a
putative zinc-binding protein in Drosophila, and Farlie et al. (2001)
also identified YPEL1 homologs in quail and several lower species. The
human and quail YPEL1 proteins are identical. In situ hybridization of
mouse embryos detected expression of Ypel1 in a number of ventral
tissues, including branchial clefts and arches, which are associated
with craniofacial morphogenesis, and heart. The dorsal embryo was
completely free of transcript. Fluorescence-tagged mouse Ypel1 localized
predominantly to the nuclei of human, rodent, and quail cells following
transfection. Endogenous Ypel1 was detected within a proportion of
mesenchymal cells in quail branchial arch outgrowth cultures, but not
within ectodermal cells.

By analyzing genes on chromosome 22, followed by PCR and RACE of a fetal
brain cDNA library, Hosono et al. (2004) cloned YPEL1. The human and
monkey YPEL1 proteins are identical. YPEL1 shares 83.2 to 96.6% amino
acid identity with YPEL2 (609723), YPEL3 (609724), and YPEL4 (609725).
All YPEL proteins contain an 86-amino acid YPEL consensus sequence.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb YPEL1 transcript in fetal
brain, with weaker expression in fetal lung and kidney. A 1.0-kb YPEL1
transcript was detected in adult testis. Immunofluorescent staining of
COS-7 green monkey kidney cells localized Ypel1 to the centrosome and
nucleolus during interphase and at several punctate structures around
the mitotic apparatus during the mitotic phase.

GENE FUNCTION

Transfection of mouse Ypel1 into mouse fibroblasts resulted in confluent
cultures with the cobblestone appearance characteristic of epithelial
cells. Cells showed rearrangement of vimentin (193060), increased
circumferential F-actin (see 102610), and increased expression of NCAM
(116930).

GENE STRUCTURE

Hosono et al. (2004) determined that the YPEL1 genes contain 5 exons and
spans about 40 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated. The mouse Ypel1 gene has a
similar structure.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Farlie et al. (2001) mapped the
YPEL1 gene to chromosome 22q11.2, a region associated with several
congenital anomalies involving craniofacial malformation, including
DiGeorge syndrome (188400) and velocardiofacial syndrome (192430). They
mapped the mouse Ypel1 gene to chromosome 16 in a region that shows
homology of synteny to human chromosome 22q11.

By genomic sequence analysis, Hosono et al. (2004) mapped the human
YPEL1 gene to chromosome 22q11.2 and the mouse Ypel1 gene to chromosome
16B1. They identified an apparent processed YPEL pseudogene on
chromosome 9p24.3 that shares similarity with YEPL1 through YEPL4.

607553	TITLE *607553 EPIPLAKIN 1; EPPK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Fujiwara et al. (2001) described a patient with a subepidermal
blistering disease that resembled bullous pemphigoid both clinically and
pathologically. Using the patient serum, they obtained a cDNA clone for
the antigenic protein, which they called epiplakin, from a human
keratinocyte expression library. They obtained full-length EPPK1 cDNA
from HeLa cell and genomic cDNA libraries. The deduced protein contains
5,065 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of more than 552
kD. Epiplakin has 13 domains that are homologous to the C-terminal B
domain of desmoplakin (125647). B domains 9 through 13 and their
preceding 358-residue linker regions form 5 repeats that share almost
100% identity and contain a 7-residue epitope recognized by the patient
serum. Unlike desmoplakin, epiplakin lacks a coiled-coil rod domain, an
N-terminal domain, and a dimerization motif, which suggests that it
exists as a single-chain structure. Northern dot blot analysis detected
expression in a wide variety of tissues. Highest expression was in
liver, small intestine, colon, salivary glands, stomach, and appendix,
with lower expression in placenta, lung, brain, and bone marrow.
Immunofluorescence staining of human skin detected epiplakin in the
entire epidermis, with prominent staining of basal keratinocytes.
Staining was found in all layers of the stratified epithelium of
esophagus, in acinous cells of the parotid gland, and in mucous
epithelial cells of the stomach and colon.

606559	TITLE *606559 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 22; TRIM22
;;STIMULATED TRANS-ACTING FACTOR, 50-KD; STAF50
DESCRIPTION TRIM proteins are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box
type 1, and a B-box type 2, followed by a coiled-coil region. They are
involved in development and cell growth.

CLONING

By differential screening of cDNA libraries from IFNA (147660)/IFNB
(147640) (type I IFN)-treated and untreated Daudi lymphoblastoid cells,
Tissot and Mechti (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding TRIM22, which they
termed STAF50. Sequence analysis predicted that the 442-amino acid
protein is 44% and 41% identical to mouse Rpt1 and human SSA/RO52 (SSA1;
109092), respectively. It contains a ring finger, an intermediate motif,
and a CHC3H2 zinc finger in its N terminus, as well as a central
bipartite nuclear localization signal. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 2.8-kb transcript in type I and, to a lesser extent,
type II IFN (IFNG; 147570)-treated cells with the appropriate receptors.
In the absence of IFN treatment, TRIM22 was strongly expressed in
peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, thymus, and ovary; it was expressed
at basal levels in other tissues. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that TRIM22
is expressed as a 54-kD protein. Functional analysis indicated that
TRIM22 downregulates transcription directed by the long terminal repeat
of HIV-1 in transfected cells, suggesting that TRIM22 may be involved in
the transduction of IFN antiviral action.

By EST database searching for B-box-containing proteins, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members, including TRIM22. Northern blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of 4.5- and 3.5-kb transcripts.
Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression in diffuse cytoplasmic
speckles. Confocal microscopy failed to identify a subcellular
localization. Interaction mating analysis indicated that TRIM22 does not
form a homodimer.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Tissot et al. (1996) mapped the TRIM22 gene to chromosome
11p15, near the SSA1 gene. Reymond et al. (2001) mapped it to the same
location by radiation hybrid analysis.

;;PROTEASOME ACTIVATOR 28-GAMMA; PA28G;;
PA28-GAMMA;;
REG-GAMMA;;
KI ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PSME3 belongs to the proteasome activator subunit (PSME) gene family.
For background information on the PSME gene family, see PSME1 (600654).

CLONING

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) produce
autoantibodies against a number of nuclear antigens, including SNRP70
(180740), PCNA (176740), CDR1 (302650), and Ki. By screening a human
placenta cDNA library with a probe obtained by screening a bovine retina
cDNA library with anti-Ki sera from an SLE patient, Nikaido et al.
(1990) isolated a cDNA encoding PSME3, which they called Ki. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 254-amino acid, hydrophilic PSME3 protein
contains a nuclear localization signal and has a molecular mass of
approximately 30 kD, close to the 32 kD observed by Western blot
analysis. PSME3 shares over 99% amino acid identity with the bovine
sequence. RNA blot analysis of human placenta, bovine brain, and mouse
embryos detected 3.0- and 1.5-kb PSME3 transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC3, or NCOA3; 601937) is an oncogene
frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis, Li et al. (2006) found that endogenous
SRC3 and REG-gamma interacted in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and MCF-7
breast cancer cells. Protein pull-down assays showed the REG-gamma
interacted specifically with the HAT domain of SRC3. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNA interference (RNAi) in breast cancer and human
embryonic kidney cell lines resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in SRC3
protein levels. Conversely, REG-gamma overexpression in HeLa cells
reduced SRC3 protein levels. In vitro proteasome assays using purified
proteins showed that REG-gamma promoted degradation of SRC3 by the 20S
proteasome in a ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNAi increased estrogen receptor (ER; see 133430) target
gene expression and enhanced estradiol-mediated cell growth in MCF-7
cells, and these effects were secondary to the effect of REG-gamma on
SRC3.

MAPPING

By analysis of overlapping YAC contigs and by FISH, Albertsen et al.
(1994) mapped the PSME3 gene to 17q12-q21. Kandil et al. (1997) mapped
the mouse Psme3 gene to chromosome 14 using interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barton et al. (2004) found that mice lacking Psme3 had normal levels of
surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules,
slightly reduced Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, and normal responses
to infection with influenza or SV40 virus. However, the ability of Psme3
-/- mice to clear the pulmonary fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum
was slower than wildtype mice. Barton et al. (2004) proposed that PSME3
functions in the MHC class I antigen-processing pathway and that it
exerts an influence on proteasome cleavage specificity.

603210	TITLE *603210 JERKY, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; JRK
;;JH8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database, Morita et al. (1998) identified a human
infant brain cDNA encoding JRK, which they called JH8 (jerky homolog of
human on chromosome 8). Using this cDNA as a probe, they recovered
additional clones corresponding to the entire JH8 coding region. The
predicted 520-amino acid protein shares 76% and 41% sequence identity
with jerky and HHMJG (603211), respectively. Northern blot analysis
revealed that JH8 is expressed as a 9.5-kb mRNA in all tissues.
Additional smaller bands were also detected.

By realignment sequencing, Moore et al. (2001) determined that the JRK
gene encodes 2 isoforms of 568 and 556 amino acids, produced by
alternative splicing at the 3-prime end of the coding exon. The 48-amino
acid addition extends the highly conserved N terminus and may function
as a DNA-binding domain.

By analyzing the integration pattern of a transgene resulting in the
epilepsy phenotype of the 'jerky' mouse, Toth et al. (1995) isolated and
sequenced the jerky gene, which encodes a 370-amino acid protein with a
molecular mass of 41.7 kD. Toth et al. (1995) reported the sequence of
jerky and a corrected version in a published erratum. The predicted
protein has homology to several nuclear regulatory proteins, including
CENPB (117140), suggesting that jerky might function as a DNA-binding
protein. Moore et al. (2001) reported the revised mouse jerky sequence.
In mice, Donovan et al. (1997) found that the Jrk gene was expressed in
all tissues examined, including brain, liver, lung, spleen, testis, and
ovary. Expression in the central nervous system included the frontal
cortex, brainstem, hippocampus, thalamus, and olfactory bulb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toth et al. (1995) stated that the JRK gene contains 1 exon.

MAPPING

Toth et al. (1995) mapped the jerky gene to mouse chromosome 15 by
analysis of an interspecific backcross.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of a radiation hybrid
panel, Morita et al. (1998) mapped the JH8 gene to 8q24. The mouse
chromosome region containing jerky shows homology of synteny with human
chromosome 8q24, suggesting that JH8, rather than HHMJG, is the human
homolog of jerky.

Morita et al. (1999) redefined the location of the JRK gene to be more
than 4 Mb distant from D8S502 and the locus for childhood absence
epilepsy-1 (ECA1; 600131). Moreover, in 2 families with ECA1, Morita et
al. (1999) did not identify mutations in the JRK gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with childhood absence epilepsy evolving to juvenile
myoclonic epilepsy (EIG1; 600669), Moore et al. (2001) identified a de
novo heterozygous variation in the JRK gene (T456M). The mutation was
not present in 200 unaffected controls or 172 patients with epilepsy.
However, no functional studies were reported.

ANIMAL MODEL

Toth et al. (1995) found that insertional inactivation of the mouse
jerky gene resulted in handling-induced whole body jerks, generalized
clonic seizures, and epileptic brain activity. All homozygous animals
displayed seizures. Homozygotes also displayed some degree of kyphosis
of the thoracic spine and were proportionate dwarfs. Approximately half
died before 3 months of age. Approximately 50% of the hemizygous animals
showed generalized clonic seizures. The other hemizygous animals either
displayed seizures limited to the head and limbs or showed no seizure
activity. There was no apparent correlation between the level of jerky
mRNA and the severity of seizures in hemizygotes.

Donovan et al. (1997) demonstrated that Jrk +/- mice had higher
susceptibility to a chemical seizure-provoking agent, resulting seizures
and even occasional death, compared to wildtype. After seizures, levels
of c-Fos (164810) were increased in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
and to a lesser extent in the amygdala. Jrk -/- mice showed dwarfism,
kyphosis, and shortened life span, and male mice were sterile. The
seizure phenotype in Jrk -/- mice showed incomplete penetrance (71%),
which was not significantly different from the penetrance in hemizygous
mice (51%). These findings suggested a threshold effect in dosage
sensitivity for the seizure phenotype.

602306	TITLE *602306 RAL GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE DISSOCIATION STIMULATOR-LIKE 2; RGL2
;;RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB2L; RAB2L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Ras gene family of low molecular weight GTPases plays a central role
in membrane trafficking and is regulated in part by guanine nucleotide
dissociation stimulators (GDSs) such as RALGDS (601619). Isomura et al.
(1996) identified a fetal brain cDNA, designated RAB2L, that encodes a
predicted 122-amino acid protein with 39.5% homology to the C-terminal
(Ras-binding) region of RALGDS. However, since RAB2L has no apparent
homology to the GDS-activity domain of RALGDS, its function is likely to
be different from that of GDS proteins. By Northern blot analysis, RAB2L
was expressed as a 900-bp transcript in all tissues examined; a 3.2-kb
transcript was specifically expressed in heart and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herberg et al. (1998) determined that the RGL2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans about 7.3 kb.

MAPPING

Isomura et al. (1996) mapped the RAB2L gene to 6p21.3 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. By Southern hybridization analysis, Ando et al.
(1999) mapped the RAB2L gene, which they termed HKE1.5, approximately 5
kb centromeric of the HKE2 gene (605660). They mapped the mouse gene to
the proximal end of the H2 region.

300525	TITLE *300525 PYRIMIDINERGIC RECEPTOR P2Y, G PROTEIN-COUPLED, 8; P2RY8
;;P2Y8
P2RY8/CRLF2 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

P2RY8 is a member of the purine nucleotide G protein-coupled receptor
gene family and is located in the pseudoautosomal region of the X
chromosome (Cantagrel et al., 2004).

CLONING

While investigating a pericentric inversion on the X chromosome,
inv(X)(p22.3)(q13.2), segregating in a family with mental retardation,
Cantagrel et al. (2004) identified 2 genes disrupted by the breakpoint:
P2RY8 and KIAA2022 (300524). P2RY8 encodes a deduced 359-amino acid
protein. Using RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, Cantagrel et al.
(2004) found that P2RY8 is highly expressed in lymphocytes. Weaker
expression was seen in heart, kidney, and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors during differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line.
Granulocytic differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. Moderate
P2Y8 expression was detected in undifferentiated cells, and expression
was completely downregulated during granulocyte differentiation. P2Y8
transcription decreased until 24 hours of monocytic differentiation,
then began to return to higher levels. P2Y8 expression was barely
detectable in normal blood leukocytes.

- P2RY8/CRLF2 FUSION GENE

Mullighan et al. (2009) reported a recurring interstitial deletion of
pseudoautosomal region 1 of chromosomes X and Y in B-progenitor ALL
(613035) that juxtaposes the first, noncoding exon of P2RY8 with the
coding region of CRLF2 (300357). They identified the P2RY8/CRLF2 fusion
in 7% of individuals with B-progenitor ALL and 53% of individuals with
ALL associated with Down syndrome. CRLF2 alteration was associated with
activating JAK mutations, and expression of human P2RY8/CRLF2 together
with mutated mouse Jak2 (147796) resulted in constitutive JAK-STAT
activation and cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells overexpressing
IL7 receptor-alpha (IL7R; 146661). Mullighan et al. (2009) concluded
that rearrangement of CRLF2 and JAK mutations together contribute to
leukemogenesis in B-progenitor ALL.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cantagrel et al. (2004) determined that the P2RY8 gene contains 2 exons
separated by a 70-kb intron.

MAPPING

Cantagrel et al. (2004) identified the P2RY8 gene at the Xp22.3
breakpoint of a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the family with the pericentric inversion inv(X)(q13;p22) studied by
Cantagrel et al. (2004), 2 males related as first cousins once removed
had severe mental retardation, whereas the carrier females who
represented the genealogic connection between the 2 affected males were
phenotypically unaffected. RT-PCR showed that the KIAA2022 transcript
was not expressed in the patients' cells, whereas the P2RY8 transcript
was expressed; the amount of P2RY8 was similar in the cells of the
affected patients and a tested carrier female. Because
haploinsufficiency of the P2RY8 gene in carrier mothers did not have a
phenotypic consequence, Cantagrel et al. (2004) concluded that the
severe mental retardation of the affected males was due to the absence
of the KIAA2022 gene product. However, screening of 20 probands from
X-linked mental retardation families revealed no mutation in the
KIAA2022 gene.

;;INTEGRIN, BETA-4, BINDING PROTEIN OF; ITGB4BP;;
p27, BETA-4 INTEGRIN-BINDING PROTEIN; p27BBP;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3A; EIF3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The integrin beta-4 subunit (ITGB4; 147557) is highly enriched in
hemidesmosomes, specialized structures providing firm mechanical links
between basal lamina and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. A
303-amino acid segment of the ITGB4 cytoplasmic domain that encompasses
the first 2 N-terminal fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains and their
interconnecting sequence is necessary for mediating ITGB4 signaling
events and incorporation into hemidesmosomes. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
system to identify polypeptides that interact with this functional
region of the ITGB4 cytodomain, Biffo et al. (1997) isolated human
epithelial cell cDNAs encoding ITGB4-binding protein (ITGB4BP), which
they called p27BBP. Southern blot analysis showed that the human genome
contains a single copy of the ITGB4BP gene. Northern blot analysis and
in situ hybridization detected Itgb4bp mRNA in all mouse tissues
examined, with the highest levels mainly in proliferating epithelia and
in epithelial tissues containing Itgb4. The predicted human ITGB4BP
protein has 245 amino acids and lacks a signal sequence. Western blot
analysis using antibodies against ITGB4BP detected a 27-kD protein in
epithelial cell lysates, which is in agreement with the calculated
molecular mass of ITGB4BP. Both in yeast and in vitro, ITGB4BP
specifically bound to the first 2 FNIII domains of ITGB4. ITGB4BP is an
insoluble protein that is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It is
associated with the intermediate filament pool and is localized at the
submembrane level in close apposition with ITGB4. The authors suggested
that ITGB4BP links ITGB4 to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-6 (EIF6) binds to the 60S
ribosomal subunit and prevents its association with the 40S ribosomal
subunit. Using antibodies against purified rabbit EIF6 protein to
immunoscreen a HeLa cell cDNA expression library, Si et al. (1997)
isolated a cDNA encoding EIF6. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 1.1-kb transcript in all human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ceci et al. (2003) demonstrated that the ribosomal 60S subunit is
activated by release of EIF6. In the cytoplasm, EIF6 is bound to free
60S but not to 80S subunits. Furthermore, EIF6 interacts in the
cytoplasm with RACK1 (176981), a receptor for activated protein kinase C
(PKC; see 176960). RACK1 is a major component of translating ribosomes,
which harbor significant amounts of PKC. Loading 60S subunits with EIF6
caused a dose-dependent translational block and impairment of 80S
formation, which were reversed by expression of RACK1 and stimulation of
PKC in vivo and in vitro. PKC stimulation led to EIF6 phosphorylation,
and mutation of a serine residue in the carboxy terminus of EIF6
impaired RACK1/PKC-mediated translational rescue. Ceci et al. (2003)
proposed that EIF6 release regulates subunit joining, and that RACK1
provides a physical and functional link between PKC signaling and
ribosome activation.

To elucidate how microRNAs mediate their repressive effects, Chendrimada
et al. (2007) performed biochemical and functional assays to identify
new factors in the microRNA pathway. Chendrimada et al. (2007) showed
that human RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) associated with a
multiprotein complex containing MOV10 (610742), the homolog of
Drosophila translational repressor Armitage, and proteins of the 60S
ribosome subunit. Notably, this complex contains the antiassociation
factor EIF6, a ribosome inhibitory protein known to prevent productive
assembly of the 80S ribosome. Depletion of EIF6 in human cells
specifically abrogated miRNA-mediated regulation of target protein and
mRNA levels. Similarly, depletion of EIF6 in C. elegans diminished Lin4
microRNA-mediated repression of the endogenous Lin14 and Lin28 (611043)
target protein and mRNA levels. Chendrimada et al. (2007) concluded that
their results uncovered an evolutionarily conserved function of the
ribosome antiassociation factor EIF6 in microRNA-mediated
posttranscriptional silencing.

Gandin et al. (2008) demonstrated that mammalian eIF6 is required for
efficient initiation of translation in vivo. Eif6-null mouse embryos
were lethal at preimplantation. Heterozygous mice had 50% reduction of
eIF6 levels in all tissues, and showed reduced mass of hepatic and
adipose tissues due to a lower number of cells and to impaired G1/S cell
cycle progression. eIF6 heterozygous cells retained sufficient nucleolar
eIF6 and normal ribosome biogenesis. The liver of eIF6 heterozygous mice
displayed an increase of 80S in polysomal profiles, indicating a defect
in initiation of translation. Consistently, isolated hepatocytes had
impaired insulin-stimulated translation. Heterozygous mouse embryonic
fibroblasts recapitulated the organism phenotype and had normal ribosome
biogenesis, reduced insulin-stimulated translation, and delayed G1/S
phase progression. Furthermore, eIf6 heterozygous cells were resistant
to oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, Gandin et al. (2008) concluded
that eIF6 is the first eIF associated with the large 60S subunit that
regulates translation in response to extracellular signals.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sanvito et al. (1998) mapped the
ITGB4BP gene to 20q11.2.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

614971	TITLE *614971 TAURINE-UPREGULATED GENE 1, NONCODING; TUG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), such as TUG1, are thought to
be involved in long-range control of chromatin structure and gene
expression (Khalil et al., 2009).

CLONING

Young et al. (2005) cloned 3 splice variants of mouse Tug1, and they
identified 4 possible splice variants of human TUG1. The human cDNAs
were 3.3, 5.9, 6.4, and 9.7 kb long. Only a single putative 51-residue
ORF within an adequate Kozak context was conserved between mouse and
human, but it was not included in all mouse and human TUG1 variants.
Northern blot analysis detected highest Tug1 expression in mouse cortex
and retina, with lower expression in heart and kidney and weak
expression in muscle and spleen. In situ hybridization revealed Tug1
expression in several areas of the mouse central nervous system at
postnatal day 0, including spinal cord, olfactory epithelium,
hippocampus, and cortex. In developing mouse retina, Tug1 expression
peaked between embryonic day 18 and postnatal day 6. EST database
analysis detected high TUG1 expression in a variety of human tissues.
Young et al. (2005) also detected weak expression of a mouse cDNA that
originated from the Tug1 opposite strand. Database analysis revealed
orthologs of TUG1 in several mammals, but not in lower vertebrates,
nematodes, or flies.

Khalil et al. (2009) developed a method of identifying lincRNAs based on
a distinctive chromatin signature that marked actively transcribed genes
and then selecting for genes that lacked protein-coding potential. Using
this method, they identified TUG1. TUG1 was ubiquitously expressed in
human and mouse tissues and cells. RNA FISH detected TUG1 localized to
nuclear and cytoplasmic foci in human fetal foot fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Young et al. (2005) showed that taurine upregulated expression of mouse
Tub1 in retina. Knockdown of Tug1 variants in mouse eyes via
electroporation of small interfering RNAs resulted in disrupted retinal
morphology, which was accompanied by signs of apoptosis and altered
retinal gene expression.

Khalil et al. (2009) showed that TUG1 coimmunoprecipitated with SUZ12
(606245), a component of polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) in human
fetal lung and foot fibroblasts and HeLa cells. TUG1 also
coimmunoprecipitated with the COREST (RCOR; 607675) repressive complex.
TUG1 expression was induced by p53 (TP53; 191170) in response to DNA
damage. Depletion of TUG1 via small interfering RNA resulted in
upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation in fetal lung
and foot fibroblasts. Khalil et al. (2009) concluded that TUG1 is
induced by p53 and represses gene expression via interaction with PCR2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Young et al. (2005) determined that the TUG1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 10 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Young et al. (2005) mapped the TUG1 gene
to chromosome 22q12.2. They mapped the mouse Tug1 gene to chromosome
11A1.

600128	TITLE *600128 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4C, cAMP-SPECIFIC; PDE4C
;;DUNCE-LIKE PHOSPHODIESTERASE E1, FORMERLY; DPDE1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclic nucleotides are important second messengers that regulate and
mediate a number of cellular responses to extracellular signals, such as
hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the cellular concentrations of cyclic
nucleotides and thereby play a role in signal transduction. PDE4C is a
class IV cAMP-specific PDE (summary by Milatovich et al., 1994).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on Drosophila dnc and rat Dpd to amplify
human DPD orthologs, followed by low-stringency hybridization of a brain
cDNA library, Bolger et al. (1993) cloned a partial DPDE1 cDNA, which
they called PDE21. RNase protection assays detected the PDE21 transcript
in retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines, but not in 5 other cell
lines examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1999) determined that the PDE4C gene spans at least 38
kb and contains at least 18 exons. Comparison of the published human
PDE4C cDNA sequences with those of the genomic DNA revealed 4
alternatively spliced exons and suggested that the PDE4C gene has at
least 3 alternative promoters.

MAPPING

Using Southern analyses of somatic cell hybrid lines and of recombinant
inbred mouse strains, as well as FISH, Milatovich et al. (1994) mapped
the 4 PDE4 genes in human and mouse. They assigned the PDE4C gene to
human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 8.

By FISH, Sullivan et al. (1999) localized the PDE4C gene to 19p13.1.

Sullivan et al. (1999) found that cosmids containing PDE4C also
contained the JUND (165162) and RAB3A (179490) genes. Analysis of the
cosmids showed that 27 kb separate JUND and PDE4C, while only 3.7 kb
separate PDE4C and RAB3A. The 3 genes share the same orientation of
transcription and are arranged in the 5-prime-to-3-prime order as
follows: JUND--PDE4C--RAB3A--tel.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1082. The deduced protein
shares significant similarity with rat Tsga (JMJD1A; 611512), a protein
expressed only in testis. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate to high
expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific brain regions
examined.

Lai et al. (2000) identified C5ORF7 within a region of chromosome 5q
frequently deleted in malignant myelomas. By EST analysis, screening a
bone marrow cDNA library, 5-prime RACE, and RT-PCR, they cloned C5ORF7.
The deduced 1,417-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 155 kD. It contains a putative zinc finger domain and a bipartite
nuclear localization signal. Northern blot analysis of lymphoid tissues
detected a transcript of about 7.5 kb. RNA dot blot analysis detected
expression in all 50 tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2000) determined that the
C5ORF7 gene contains 24 exons and spans about 64 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped KIAA1082 to
chromosome 5. By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2000) mapped the
C5ORF7 gene to chromosome 5q31.

603725	TITLE *603725 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 17; FGF17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), such as FGF17, are growth factors and
oncogenes that contain a conserved, approximately 120-amino acid core.
Individual FGFs play important roles in embryonic development, cell
growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, inflammation, angiogenesis, and
tumor growth and invasion (Hoshikawa et al., 1998).

CLONING

Hoshikawa et al. (1998) isolated human, mouse, and rat cDNAs encoding a
novel member of the FGF family, FGF17. The deduced 216-amino acid human
FGF17 protein is 98.6% identical to the mouse and rat Fgf17 proteins,
which are identical. Among known FGF family members, the FGF17 protein
is most similar to FGF8 (600483). FGF17 contains a typical hydrophobic
signal sequence at its N terminus, and the authors demonstrated that
recombinant rat Fgf17 can be efficiently secreted by High Five insect
cells. PCR analysis of rat adult tissues detected Fgf17 expression in
all tissues examined. In rat 14.5-day embryos, in situ hybridization
showed highest Fgf17 expression in the isthmus cerebellar and septum
neuroepithelia of the brain.

Using RT-PCR, Krejci et al. (2007) detected expression of several FGF
genes in femoral growth plate cartilage from 20- to 28-week gestation
fetuses; however, only FGF1 (131220), FGF2 (134920), FGF17, and FGF19
(603891) proteins were expressed at detectable levels.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that FGF17 and FGF19 were uniformly
expressed throughout the growth plate. In contrast, FGF1 was expressed
only in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones, and FGF2 was expressed
only in the proliferative and resting zones.

To link FGF17 to GnRH (see 152760) biology, Miraoui et al. (2013)
examined Fgf17 expression in the nasal cavity of mouse embryos at
embryonic day 10.5, when GnRH neuron fate specification occurs. Fgf17
was robustly expressed in regions where Fgf8 is known to be highly
expressed: the commissural plate, the midbrain-hindbrain junction, and
the medial olfactory placode, where GnRH neurons emerge. Miraoui et al.
(2013) noted that there was hardly any Fgf17 expression in Fgf8
hypomorphic mice, suggesting that FGF17 should be considered a member of
the FGF8 synexpression group.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the Cre/loxP system, Sun et al. (2000) found that maintenance of
Fgf9 (600921) and Fgf17 expression is dependent on Shh (600725), whereas
Fgf8 expression is not. Sun et al. (2000) developed a model in which no
individual Fgf expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge is solely
necessary to maintain Shh expression, but instead the combined activity
of 2 or more apical ectodermal ridge Fgfs function in a positive
feedback loop with Shh to control limb development.

Krejci et al. (2007) showed that FGF1, FGF2, and FGF17, but not FGF19,
elicited potent activation of an ERK (see 601795) reporter gene in
primary cultures of human fetal chondrocytes. FGF1, FGF2, and FGF17, but
not FGF19, also inhibited proliferation of FGFR3 (134934)-expressing rat
chondrosarcoma chondrocytes.

Mariani et al. (2008) demonstrated that mouse limbs lacking Fgf4
(164980), Fgf9, and Fgf17 have normal skeletal pattern, indicating that
Fgf8 (600483) is sufficient among apical ectodermal ridge fibroblast
growth factors (AER-FGFs) to sustain normal limb formation. Inactivation
of Fgf8 alone causes a mild skeletal phenotype; however, when Mariani et
al. (2008) also removed different combinations of the other AER-FGF
genes, they obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes of increasing
severity, reflecting the contribution that each FGF can make to the
total AER-FGF signal. Analysis of the compound mutant limb buds revealed
that, in addition to sustaining cell survival, AER-FGFs regulate
proximal-distal patterning gene expression during early limb bud
development, providing genetic evidence that AER-FGFs function to
specify a distal domain and challenging the longstanding hypothesis that
AER-FGF signaling is permissive rather than instructive for limb
patterning. Mariani et al. (2008) also developed a 2-signal model for
proximal-distal patterning to explain early specification.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 unrelated individuals with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), Miraoui et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for
missense mutations in the FGF17 gene (603725.0001-603725.0003). One of
the 3 probands belonged to a large consanguineous 10-generation French
Canadian family with anosmic HH and cleft palate (see HH2, 147950), in
which Tornberg et al. (2011) had identified missense mutations in both
the FGFR1 (136350.0025) and HS6ST1 (604846.0002) genes; in that proband,
Miraoui et al. (2013) also identified 2 missense mutations in another
FGF-network gene, FLRT3 (604808.0001 and 604808.0002). Miraoui et al.
(2013) concluded that mutations in genes encoding components of the FGF
pathway are associated with complex modes of congenital HH (CHH)
inheritance and act primarily as contributors to an oligogenic genetic
architecture underlying CHH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using whole brain imaging, Cholfin and Rubenstein (2007) found that mice
lacking Fgf17 showed a selective reduction in the size of the dorsal
frontal cortex, whereas the ventral/orbital frontal cortex was normal.
These changes were complemented by a rostromedial shift of sensory
cortical areas. The changes in regionalization persisted into adulthood.
Cholfin and Rubenstein (2007) concluded that FGF17 functions similarly
to FGF8 in patterning the neocortical map, but FGF17 is more selective
in regulating the properties of the dorsal but not ventral frontal
cortex.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 20 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
FGF17, ILE108THR

In the female proband from a large consanguineous 10-generation French
Canadian family with anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH20;
615270) and cleft palate, previously reported by White et al. (1983) and
in whom Tornberg et al. (2011) had identified missense mutations in the
FGFR1 (R250Q; 136350.0025) and HS6ST1 (R296W; 604846.0002) genes,
Miraoui et al. (2013) also identified heterozygosity for a c.323T-C
transition in exon 4 of the FGF17 gene, resulting in an ile108-to-thr
(I108T) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the FGF core
domain. In addition, the proband was heterozygous and homozygous for 2
missense mutations in another FGF-network gene, FLRT3 (E97G, 604808.0001
and S144I, 604808.0002, respectively). Three other affected family
members also carried mutations in the FGFR1, HS6ST1, and FLRT3 genes,
and 4 unaffected family members carried 1 or 2 mutations in those genes,
but none had a mutation in the FGF17 gene. The I108T mutation was not
found in 155 controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Analysis
of physical interactions between the ligand-binding region of FGFR1 and
FGF17 by surface-plasmon-resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the
I108T mutant was defective in FGFR1 activation compared to wildtype; in
addition, the I108T mutant completely failed to activate the R250Q FGFR1
mutant, indicating that these 2 loss-of-function substitutions act in an
additive manner.

.0002
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 20 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
FGF17, ARG177HIS

In a sporadic male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), Miraoui et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
c.530G-A transition in exon 5 of the FGF17 gene, resulting in an
arg177-to-his (R177H) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
FGF core domain. The patient, who had a normal sense of smell, also
displayed low bone mass. The R177H mutation was not found in 155
controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Analysis of physical
interactions between the ligand-binding region of FGFR1 (135350) and
FGF17 by surface-plasmon-resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the
R177H mutant had dramatically reduced ability to activate FGFR1 compared
to wildtype.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 20 WITH ANOSMIA
FGF17, ASN187SER

In a sporadic male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), who was anosmic, Miraoui et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.560A-G transition in exon 5 of the FGF17 gene,
resulting in an asn187-to-ser (N187S) substitution at a conserved
residue in the C terminus. The mutation was not found in 155 controls or
in the 1000 Genomes Project database.

604712	TITLE *604712 RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, M2 B; RRM2B
;;RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE SMALL SUBUNIT 2-LIKE, p53-INDUCIBLE; P53R2;;
p53-INDUCIBLE AND RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE SMALL SUBUNIT 2-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RRM2B gene encodes the small subunit of p53 (191170)-inducible
ribonucleotide reductase, a heterotetrameric enzyme responsible for de
novo conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates into the corresponding
deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates that are essential for DNA synthesis
(Bourdon et al., 2007).

CLONING

The p53 gene is frequently inactivated in human cancers. By using
differential display to examine mRNAs in a human colon cancer cell line
carrying a highly regulated wildtype p53 expression system, Tanaka et
al. (2000) detected a 5.5-kb transcript that was inducible by wildtype
p53 but not mutant p53. Using the differential display fragment
representing this transcript as a probe to screen a skeletal muscle cDNA
library, they isolated a cDNA sequence that incorporated an open reading
frame of 351 amino acids with 80% identity to the small subunit of human
ribonucleotide reductase (R2; 180390). Comparison of this sequence,
which they called p53R2 for 'p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase
small subunit 2 homolog,' with those of yeast RNR2 and RNR4 revealed 60%
and 40% identity, respectively. Tanaka et al. (2000) considered p53R2 to
be a human counterpart of yeast RNR2. The protein has a ribonucleotide
reductase small subunit signature and 2 putative nuclear localization
signal sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tanaka et al. (2000) found that the p53R2 gene consists of 9 exons and
spans a 30-kb genomic region. Electromobility shift assays identified a
20-nucleotide region in intron 1 as the p53 binding site.

MAPPING

Tanaka et al. (2000) mapped the p53R2 gene to chromosome 8q23.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (2000) found that expression of p53R2, but not R2, was
induced by ultraviolet and gamma-irradiation and adriamycin treatment in
a wildtype p53-dependent manner. Induction of p53R2 in p53-deficient
cells caused G2/M arrest and protected cells from death in response to
adriamycin. Inhibition of endogenous p53R2 expression in cells that had
an intact p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint reduced ribonucleotide
reductase activity, DNA repair, and cell survival after exposure to
various genotoxins. Tanaka et al. (2000) demonstrated nuclear
accumulation of p53R2 protein in response to genotoxic stress induced by
gamma-irradiation. Tanaka et al. (2000) concluded that p53R2 encodes a
ribonucleotide reductase that is directly involved in the p53 checkpoint
for repair of damaged DNA. The discovery of p53R2 clarified a
relationship between a ribonucleotide reductase activity involved in
repair of damaged DNA and tumor suppression by p53. Tanaka et al. (2000)
proposed that inactivation of p53 directly interferes with the
transcription of p53R2 in response to DNA damage, with the result that
ribonucleotide reductase activity is insufficient for normal DNA repair.
Faulty regulation of p53R2 might also enhance misincorporation of
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and dysregulation of DNA
repair machinery and thereby increase the frequency of mutations. Tanaka
et al. (2000) suggested that the genomic instability often seen in
tumors lacking wildtype p53 may reflect dysfunction of ribonucleotide
reductase due to the failure of p53R2 induction.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome 8A (Encephalomyopathic
Type with Renal Tubulopathy)

In 7 patients from 4 families with severe autosomal recessive
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome-8A (MTDPS8A; 612075),
associated with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon et al. (2007) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the RRM2B gene (see,
e.g., 604712.0001-604712.0005). All patients had 1 to 2% residual mtDNA
in skeletal muscle and died in the first months of life with severe
lactic acidosis. Respiratory chain complex activities were severely
decreased in muscle from these patients. The findings indicated that
RRM2B plays a crucial role in dNTP supply, especially for the synthesis
of mtDNA.

- Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome 8B (MNGIE Type)

Shaibani et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RRM2B gene (R110H, 604712.0008; R121H, 604712.0009) in
a 42-year-old woman with mtDNA depletion syndrome-8B, manifest as a
neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (see 612075). The authors stated
that this was the oldest reported patient with RRM2B mutations and that
her clinical course was different from that reported previously in
patients with MNGIE.

- Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia
5

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in a large
North American family with mild autosomal dominant progressive external
ophthalmoplegia-5 (PEOA5; 613077), Tyynismaa et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the RRM2B gene (R327X; 604712.0006) that
segregated with the disorder. Affected members of an unrelated Hungarian
family carried the same mutation, but there was no evidence of a common
origin.

By direct sequencing of the RRM2B gene in 75 unrelated probands with PEO
in whom mutations in other known PEO-related genes had been excluded,
Fratter et al. (2011) identified 3 different heterozygous truncating
mutations in the RRM2B gene (see, e.g., 604712.0010 and 604712.0011) in
7 (9.3%) patients. The findings suggested that truncating RRM2B
mutations are rather frequent in familial PEO with mtDNA deletions.
Three additional patients were found to carry 3 different heterozygous
missense variants, but the pathogenicity of the variants was considered
provisional in the absence of further supporting evidence.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine whether ribonucleotide reductase is involved in DNA repair
by supplying deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) for resting cells in vivo,
Kimura et al. (2003) generated a strain of mice lacking Rrm2b. These
mice developed normally until they were weaned but from then on had
growth retardation and early mortality. Pathologic examination indicated
that multiple organs had failed, and all Rrm2b-null mice died from
severe renal failure by the age of 14 weeks. TUNEL staining showed a
greater number of apoptotic cells in kidneys of 8-week-old null mice
relative to wildtype. p53 (191170) was activated in kidney tissues of
the null mice, leading to transcriptional induction of p53 target genes.
Embryonic fibroblasts from null mice became immortal much earlier than
wildtype embryonic fibroblasts. dNTP pools were severely attenuated in
embryonic fibroblasts from null mice under oxidative stress. Rrm2b
deficiency caused higher rates of spontaneous mutation in the kidneys of
null mice. The results suggested that p53R2 has a pivotal role in
maintaining dNTP levels for repair of DNA in resting cells. Impairment
of this pathway may enhance spontaneous mutation frequency and activate
p53-dependent apoptotic pathways in vivo, causing severe renal failure,
growth retardation, and early mortality.

Bourdon et al. (2007) found that 12-week-old Rrm2b-null mice had
markedly decreased mtDNA content in kidney (5.57% of controls), muscle
(5.24%), and liver (21%).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLN284TER

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with mitochondrial
DNA depletion syndrome-8A (MTDPS8A; 612075), manifest as
encephalomyopathy and renal tubulopathy, Bourdon et al. (2007)
identified a homozygous 850C-T transition in the RRM2B gene, resulting
in a gln284-to-ter (Q284X) substitution. The substitution resulted in
the deletion of the last 68 C-terminal residues of the protein,
including part of the an alpha-helix as well as the heptapeptide
involved in the binding to R1. The sibs had hypotonia and lactic
acidosis and died within the first months of life. Severe mtDNA
depletion (less than 1% of controls) was found in muscle of 1 the sibs.

RRM2B, IVS3AS, A-G, -2

In 2 French infants with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8A
(612075), manifest as encephalomyopathy with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon
et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RRM2B gene: an A-to-G transition in intron 3 and E194K (604712.0003).
The sibs had lactic acidemia, hypotonia, tubulopathy, and seizures. Only
2% of normal mtDNA levels was detected in the muscle of 1 of the sibs.
Both died at 2 months of age.

RRM2B, GLU194LYS

In 2 French infants with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8A
(612075), manifest as encephalomyopathy with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon
et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RRM2B gene: a 580G-A transition, resulting in a glu194-to-lys (E194K)
substitution, and a splice site mutation (604712.0002). Residue 194 is
involved in iron binding.

.0004
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, 3-BP DEL, 253GAG

In a French infant with severe mitochondrial DNA depletion with renal
tubulopathy (612075), Bourdon et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 3-bp deletion
(253delGAG), resulting in an in-frame deletion of glu85, and C236F
(604712.0005). The patient had neonatal hypotonia and increased plasma
and CSF lactate; she died at age 3 months. Muscle histology showed
ragged-red fibers, and mtDNA content was about 1% of normal. The
deletion of glu85 was predicted to disrupt the local subdomain structure
and the dimerization interface between R1 and R2.

RRM2B, CYS236PHE

In a French infant with severe mitochondrial DNA depletion with renal
tubulopathy (612075), Bourdon et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 707G-T transversion,
resulting in a cys236-to-phe (C236F) substitution, and a 3-bp deletion
(604712.0004).

PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS,
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 5
RRM2B, ARG327TER

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
progressive external ophthalmoplegia-5 (PEOA5; 613077), Tyynismaa et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous 979C-T transition in the last exon of
the RRM2B gene, resulting in an arg327-to-ter (R327X) substitution. The
substitution was predicted to result in a protein lacking the last 25
amino acids. One family was North American of European origin, and the
second was Hungarian. The mutation was not observed in 380 control
European chromosomes, and there was no evidence of a founder effect. The
phenotype was characterized by late-onset of mild ophthalmoplegia and
mild muscle weakness. Skeletal muscle biopsies showed mtDNA deletions,
but normal mtDNA copy numbers. RNA studies showed that the R328X mRNA
escaped nonsense-mediated decay, and that the mutant protein was
expressed and stable. The findings suggested that the mutant RRM2B
protein can compete with wildtype in binding to ribonucleotide
reductase, causing a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect.

.0007
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLY229VAL

In 2 Sudanese brothers, born of consanguineous parents, with
encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (612075),
Kollberg et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 686G-T transversion in
exon 7 of the RRM2B gene, resulting in a gly229-to-val (G229V)
substitution in the diferric iron center of the protein. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. The phenotype was severe, with
hypotonia, seizures, poor visual contact, and lactic acidosis, and both
patients died by 5 months of age. One boy developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy. Southern blot analysis of patient cells showed severe mtDNA
depletion, about 1 to 4% of normal controls.

.0008
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8B (MNGIE TYPE)
RRM2B, ARG110HIS

In a 42-year-old woman with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8B,
manifest as mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome
(MNGIE; see 612075), Shaibani et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 329G-A transition
resulting in an arg110-to-his (R110H) substitution, and a 362G-A
transition resulting in an arg121-to-his (R121H; 604712.0009)
substitution. Both mutations occurred in highly conserved residues. The
patient developed recurrent nausea, vomiting, and weight loss at age 30
years. At age 37, she developed restriction of eye movements, ptosis,
dysarthria, unsteady gait, muscle weakness, and areflexia consistent
with a peripheral neuropathy. Skeletal muscle showed mtDNA depletion
(12% of controls). Shaibani et al. (2009) noted that this was the oldest
reported patient with RRM2B mutations and that her clinical course was
different from that reported previously in patients with MNGIE. The
findings also broadened the phenotype associated with RRM2B mutations to
include an MNGIE-like picture.

PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS,
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 5
RRM2B, 1-BP DEL, 950T

In 3 unrelated patients with PEOA5 (613077), Fratter et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (950delT) in the RRM2B gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at leu317. The
patients had onset at ages 30, 53, and 46 years, and all had a family
history of the disorder. All had PEO and ptosis, but additional variable
features in 2 patients included fatigue, ataxia, proximal myopathy,
dysphagia, and glaucoma. Skeletal muscle biopsies of the probands showed
a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity and multiple mtDNA
deletions. The mutation was not found in 352 control alleles.

RRM2B, 1-BP DUP, 965A

In 3 unrelated patients with PEOA5 (613077), Fratter et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp duplication (965dupA) in the RRM2B gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The patients had
onset at ages 30, 54, and 26 years, and all had a family history of the
disorder. All had PEO and fatigue, but additional features were variable
and included diabetes, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysphagia, dysphonia,
and proximal myopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsies of the probands showed a
mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity and multiple mtDNA
deletions. The mutation was not found in 352 control alleles.

.0012
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, PHE202LEU

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to progressive external ophthalmoplegia has not been
confirmed.

In a 14-year-old patient with early-onset progressive external
ophthalmoplegia at age 4 and hearing loss, Fratter et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygous changes in the RRM2B gene: a 606T-A
transversion resulting in a phe202-to-leu (F202L) substitution, and an
817G-A transition resulting in a gly273-to-ser (G273S; 604712.0013)
substitution. Functional studies of the variants were not performed.
Skeletal muscle biopsy showed a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase
activity and multiple mtDNA deletions. Neither variant was found in 352
control alleles, and both occurred in conserved residues. There was no
family history of a similar disorder, but information on the parents was
not provided. The findings suggested recessive inheritance of the
disorder.

VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, GLY273SER

See 604712.0012 and Fratter et al. (2011).

.0014
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, PRO33SER

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to progressive external ophthalmoplegia has not been
confirmed.

In a 43-year-old Japanese man, born of consanguineous parents, with
adult-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Takata et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 341G-A transition in the RRM2B gene, resulting
in a pro33-to-ser (P33S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
the N terminus. The variant was found by whole-exome sequencing in
combination with runs of homozygosity analysis. Each unaffected parent
was heterozygous for the mutation, which was found in 1 of 718 control
chromosomes of Japanese origin. Functional studies of the variant were
not performed. The patient presented with hearing loss at age 16 years,
and later developed ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and muscle weakness. He
also had pigmentary degeneration of the retina and gonadal atrophy.
Other features included depressed mood, anxiety, and hypochondriacal
complaints. Muscle biopsy showed marked variation of fiber size,
ragged-red fibers, COX-negative fibers, and multiple mtDNA deletions.
There was no family history of a similar disorder. Mutations in other
candidate genes were excluded. Takata et al. (2011) suggested that this
was the first case of recessive inheritance of PEO due to RRM2B
mutations.

613113	TITLE *613113 NEUROFIBROMIN 1; NF1
;;NEUROFIBROMIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a cytoplasmic protein that is
predominantly expressed in neurons, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, and
leukocytes. It is a multidomain molecule with the capacity to regulate
several intracellular processes, including the RAS (see 190020)-cyclic
AMP pathway, the ERK (600997)/MAP (see 600178) kinase cascade, adenylyl
cyclase, and cytoskeletal assembly (summary by Trovo-Marqui and Tajara,
2006).

CLONING

Buchberg et al. (1990) sequenced a portion of the murine NF1 gene and
showed that the predicted amino acid sequence is nearly the same as the
corresponding region of the human NF1 gene product. Computer searches
identified homology between the mouse NF1 gene and the Ira1 and Ira2
genes identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which negatively regulate
the RAS-cyclic AMP pathway. RAS proteins are involved in the control of
proliferation and differentiation in mammalian cells. Their activity is
modulated by their ability to bind and hydrolyze guanine nucleotides.
GTP-binding activates RAS, whereas GTP hydrolysis inactivates RAS.
Mutant forms of RAS found in human tumors have greatly decreased GTPase
activity, resulting in accumulation of RAS in the GTP-bound active form.

Xu et al. (1990) extended the known open reading frame of the human NF1
gene by cDNA walking and sequencing. The new sequence predicted 2,485
amino acids of the NF1 peptide. A 360-residue region showed significant
similarity to the catalytic domains of both human and bovine
GTPase-activating protein (GAP; 139150). Xu et al. (1990) suggested that
NF1 encodes a cytoplasmic GAP-like protein that may be involved in the
control of cell growth by interacting with proteins such as the RAS gene
product.

Marchuk et al. (1991) reported an extensive cDNA walk resulting in the
cloning of the complete coding region of the NF1 transcript. Analysis of
the sequences revealed an open reading frame of 2,818 amino acids,
although alternatively spliced products may code for different protein
isoforms.

To study the NF1 gene product, Gutmann et al. (1991) raised antibodies
against both fusion proteins and synthetic peptides. A specific protein
of about 250 kD was identified by both immunoprecipitation and
immunoblotting. The protein was found in all tissues and cell lines
examined and was detected in human, rat, and mouse tissues. Based on the
homology between the NF1 gene product and members of the GAP
superfamily, the name NF1-GAP-related protein (NF1-GRD) was suggested.
DeClue et al. (1991) raised rabbit antisera to a bacterially synthesized
peptide corresponding to the GAP-related domain of NF1 (NF1-GRD). The
sera specifically detected a 280-kD protein in lysates of HeLa cells.
This protein corresponded to the NF1 gene product, as shown by several
criteria. NF1 was present in a large molecular mass complex in
fibroblast and schwannoma cell lines and appeared to associate with a
very large (400-500 kD) protein in both cell lines.

Daston et al. (1992) raised antibodies against peptides coded by
portions of the NF1 cDNA. These antibodies specifically recognized a
220-kD protein, called neurofibromin, in both human and rat spinal cord.
Neurofibromin was most abundant in the nervous system. Immunostaining of
tissue sections indicated that neurons, oligodendrocytes, and
nonmyelinating Schwann cells contained neurofibromin, whereas astrocytes
and myelinating Schwann cells did not.

Trovo-Marqui and Tajara (2006) stated that 4 splicing exons (9a, 10a-2,
23a, and 48a) are responsible for the production of 5 human
neurofibromin isoforms (II, 3, 4 9a and 10a-2), which exhibit
differential expression in distinct tissues. Neurofibromin II, named
GRD2 (domain II-related GAP), is the result of the insertion of exon
23a, is expressed in Schwann cells, and has a reduced capacity of acting
as GAP. Neurofibromins 3 and 4, which contain exon 48a and both exons
23a and 48a, respectively, are expressed in muscle tissue, mainly in
cardiac and skeleton muscles. Neurofibromin 9a (also called 9br) is the
result of the inclusion of exon 9a and shows limited neuronal
expression. Isoform 10a is the result of insertion of exon 10a, which
introduces a transmembrane domain. This isoform has been observed in the
majority of human tissues analyzed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (1990) found that 3 active genes, called OMGP (164345), EVI2B
(158381), and EVI2A (158380), lie within an intron of NF1 but in
opposite orientation.

Xu et al. (1992) found a pseudogene of the AK3L1 gene (103030) in an
intron of the NF1 gene. It appeared to be a processed pseudogene since
it lacked introns and contained a polyadenylate tract; it nevertheless
retained coding potential because the open reading frame was not
impaired by any observed base substitutions.

Heim et al. (1994) cited evidence that the NF1 gene spans approximately
350 kb of genomic DNA, encodes an mRNA of 11 to 13 kb, and contains at
least 56 exons.

Li et al. (1995) showed that the 5-prime end of the NF1 gene is embedded
in a CpG island containing a NotI restriction site and that the
remainder of the gene lies in the adjacent 35-kb NotI fragment. In their
efforts to develop a comprehensive screen for NF1 mutations, they
isolated genomic DNA clones that together contain the entire NF1 cDNA
sequence. They identified all intron-exon boundaries of the coding
region and established that it contains at least 59 exons. The 3-prime
untranslated region of the NF1 gene was found to span approximately 3.5
kb and to be continuous with the stop codon.

Trovo-Marqui and Tajara (2006) stated that the NF1 gene contains 61
exons.

MAPPING

Barker et al. (1987) demonstrated that the gene responsible for
neurofibromatosis (NF1; 162200) is located in the pericentromeric region
of chromosome 17.

Wallace et al. (1990) identified a large transcript from the candidate
NF1 region on chromosome 17q11.2 that was disrupted in 3 patients with
neurofibromatosis type I. The changes disrupted expression of the NF1
transcript in all 3 patients, consistent with the hypothesis that it
acts as a tumor suppressor.

- Pseudogenes

Legius et al. (1992) characterized an NF1-related locus on chromosome
15. The nonprocessed NF1 pseudogene (NF1P1) can produce additional
fragments in Southern blotting, pulsed field gel, and PCR experiments
with some NF1 cDNA probes or oligonucleotides. In addition, certain
regions of the NF1 gene cross-hybridize with a locus on chromosome 14.
These loci can cause confusion in the mutation analysis of patients with
NF1.

Numerous NF1 pseudogenes have been identified in the human genome. Those
in 2q21, 14q11, and 22q11 form a subset with a similar genomic
organization and a high sequence homology. By PCR and fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Luijten et al. (2001) studied the extent of the
homology of the regions surrounding these NF1 pseudogenes. They found
that a fragment of at least 640 kb is homologous between the 3 regions.
Based on previous studies and these new findings, they proposed a model
for the spreading of the NF1 pseudogene-containing regions. A fragment
of approximately 640 kb was first duplicated in chromosome region 2q21
and transposed to 14q11. Subsequently, this fragment was duplicated in
14q11 and transposed to 22q11. A part of the 640-kb fragment in 14q11,
with a length of about 430 kb, was further duplicated to a variable
extent in 14q11. In addition, Luijten et al. (2001) identified sequences
that may facilitate the duplication and transposition of the 640-kb and
430-kb fragments.

GENE FUNCTION

DeClue et al. (1992) presented evidence implicating the NF1 protein as a
tumor suppressor gene product that negatively regulates p21(ras) (see
190020) and defined a 'positive' growth role for RAS activity in NF1
malignancies.

Basu et al. (1992) presented evidence supporting the hypothesis that NF1
is a tumor-suppressor gene whose product acts upstream of the RAS
proteins. They showed that the RAS proteins in malignant tumor cell
lines from patients with NF1 were in a constitutively activated state as
measured by the ratio of the guanine nucleotides bound to them, i.e.,
the ratio of GTP (active) to GDP (inactive). Transforming mutants of
p21(ras) bind large amounts of GTP, whereas wildtype p21(ras) is almost
entirely GDP-bound.

Nakafuku et al. (1993) took advantage of the yeast RAS system to isolate
mutants in the RAS GTPase activating protein-related domain of the NF1
gene product (NF1-GRD) that can act as antioncogenes specific for
oncogenic RAS. They demonstrated that these mutant NF1-GRDs, when
expressed in mammalian cells, were able to induce morphologic reversion
of RAS-transformed NIH 3T3 cells.

Johnson et al. (1993) stated that in schwannoma cell lines from patients
with neurofibromatosis, loss of neurofibromin is associated with
impaired regulation of GTP/RAS. They analyzed other neural crest-derived
tumor cell lines and showed that some melanoma and neuroblastoma cell
lines established from tumors occurring in patients without
neurofibromatosis also contained reduced or undetectable levels of
neurofibromin, with concomitant genetic abnormalities of the NF1 locus.
In contrast to the schwannoma cell lines, however, GTP/RAS was
appropriately regulated in the melanoma and neuroblastoma lines that
were deficient in neurofibromin, even when HRAS (190020) was
overexpressed. These results demonstrated that some neural crest tumors
not associated with neurofibromatosis have acquired somatically
inactivated NF1 genes and suggested a tumor-suppressor function for
neurofibromin that is independent of RAS GTPase activation.

Silva et al. (1997) cited several studies that suggested a role of
neurofibromin in brain function. The expression of the NF1 gene is
largely restricted to neuronal tissues in the adult. This
GTPase-activating protein may act as a negative regulator of
neurotrophin (see BDNF; 113505)-mediated signaling. They also noted
immunohistochemical studies that suggested that activation of astrocytes
may be common in the brain of NF1 patients.

In a review of the molecular neurobiology of human cognition, Weeber and
Sweatt (2002) presented an overview of the RAS-ERK-CREB pathway,
including the function of NF1. The authors discussed publications that
implicated dysfunction of this signal transduction cascade in cognitive
defects, including mental retardation caused by mutation in the NF1
gene.

Vogel et al. (1995) used a targeted disruption of the NF1 gene in mice
to examine the role of neurofibromin in the acquisition of neurotrophin
dependence in embryonic neurons. They showed that both neural crest- and
placode-derived sensory neurons isolated from NF1 -/- embryos develop,
extend neurites, and survive in the absence of neurotrophins, whereas
their wildtype counterparts die rapidly unless nerve growth factor
(162030) or BDNF is added to the culture medium. Moreover, NF1 -/-
sympathetic neurons survive for extended periods and acquire mature
morphology in the presence of NGF-blocking antibodies. These results
were considered by Vogel et al. (1995) as consistent with a model
wherein neurofibromin acts as a negative regulator of
neurotrophin-mediated signaling for survival of embryonic peripheral
neurons.

For the most part the NF1 tumor suppressor acts through the interaction
of its GRD with the product of the RAS protooncogene. Skuse et al.
(1996) discovered an mRNA editing site within the NF1 mRNA. Editing at
this site changes a cytidine at nucleotide 2914 to a uridine, creating
an in-frame translation stop codon. The edited transcript, if
translated, would produce a protein truncated in the N-terminal region
of the GRD, thereby inactivating the NF1 tumor-suppressor function.
Analysis of RNA from a variety of cell lines, tumors, and peripheral
blood cells revealed that the NF1 mRNA undergoes editing, to different
extents, in every cell type studied. Three tumors analyzed as part of
their study, an astrocytoma, a neurofibroma, and a neurofibrosarcoma,
each had levels of NF1 mRNA editing substantially higher than did
peripheral blood leukocytes. To investigate the role played by editing
in NF1 tumorigenesis, Cappione et al. (1997) analyzed RNA from 19 NF1
and 4 non-NF1 tumors. (The authors referred to the editing site as
nucleotide 3916.) They observed varying levels in NF1 mRNA editing in
different tumors, with a higher range of editing in more malignant
tumors (e.g., neurofibrosarcomas) compared to benign tumors (cutaneous
neurofibromas). Plexiform neurofibromas had an intermediate range of
levels of NF1 mRNA editing. The constitutional levels of NF1 mRNA
editing varied slightly in NF1 individuals but were consistent with the
levels observed in non-NF1 individuals. In every case, there was a
greater level of NF1 mRNA editing in the tumor than in the nontumor
tissue from the same patient. These results suggested to Cappione et al.
(1997) that inappropriately high levels of NF1 mRNA editing indeed plays
a role in NF1 tumorigenesis and that editing may result in the
functional equivalent of biallelic inactivation of the NF1 tumor
suppressor.

Mukhopadhyay et al. (2002) studied C-to-U RNA editing in peripheral
nerve sheath tumor samples (PNSTs) from 34 patients with NF1. Whereas
most showed low levels of RNA editing, 8 of the 34 tumors demonstrated 3
to 12% C-to-U editing of NF1 RNA. These tumors demonstrated 2
distinguishing characteristics. First, these PNSTs expressed APOBEC1
(600130) mRNA, the catalytic deaminase of the holoenzyme that edits APOB
(107730) RNA. Second, NF1 RNA from these PNSTs contained increased
proportions of an alternatively spliced exon, 23A, downstream of the
edited base in which editing occurs preferentially. These findings,
together with results of both in vivo and in vitro experiments with
APOBEC1, strongly suggested an important mechanistic linkage between NF1
RNA splicing and C-to-U editing and provided a basis for understanding
the heterogeneity of posttranscriptional regulation of NF1 expression.

The NF1 tumor suppressor protein is thought to restrict cell
proliferation by functioning as a Ras-specific guanosine
triphosphatase-activating protein. However, The et al. (1997) found that
Drosophila homozygous for null mutations of an NF1 homolog show no
obvious signs of perturbed RAS1-mediated signaling. Loss of NF1 resulted
in a reduction in size of larvae, pupae, and adults. This size defect
was not modified by manipulating RAS1 signaling but was restored by
expression of activated adenosine 3-prime, 5-prime-monophosphate
-dependent protein kinase (PKA; see 176911). Thus, NF1 and PKA appear to
interact in a pathway that controls the overall growth of Drosophila.
Guo et al. (1997) showed, from a study of Drosophila NF1 mutants, that
NF1 is essential for the cellular response to the neuropeptide PACAP38
(pituitary adenylyl cyclase-adenosine activating polypeptide) at the
neuromuscular junction. The peptide induced a 3-prime,
5-prime-monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. This response was eliminated in
NF1 mutants. NF1 appeared to regulate the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl
cyclase rather than the RAS-RAF pathway. Moreover, the NF1 defect was
rescued by the exposure of cells to pharmacologic treatment that
increased concentrations of cAMP.

Gutmann (2001) reviewed the functions of neurofibromin and merlin, the
product of the NF2 gene (607379), in tumor suppression and cell-cell
signaling, respectively.

Trovo-Marqui and Tajara (2006) provided a detailed review of
neurofibromin and its role in neurofibromatosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Neurofibromatosis Type I

Using pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Upadhyaya et al. (1990)
identified a 90-kb deletion in the proximal portion of 17q in 1 of 90
unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis I. Viskochil et al. (1990)
detected deletions of 190, 40, and 11 kb in the gene located at the 17q
translocation breakpoint in 3 patients with NF1.

In an NF1 patient, Wallace et al. (1991) identified an insertion of an
Alu sequence in an intron of the NF1 gene, resulting in deletion of the
downstream exon during splicing and a frameshift (613113.0001).

Cawthon et al. (1990) identified 2 different point mutations in the NF1
gene (L348P; 613113.0003 and R365X; 613113.0004) in patients with NF1.

Upadhyaya et al. (1992) identified multiple germline NF1 mutations (see,
e.g., 613113.0006-613113.0009) in patients with NF1.

Weiming et al. (1992) identified mutations in the NF1 gene in at most 3%
of NF1 subjects in an analysis that covered 17% of the coding sequence
by SSCP and a larger region by Southern blotting. The results suggested
that most NF1 mutations lie elsewhere in the coding sequence or outside
it.

Collins (1993) developed FISH techniques to detect large deletions in
the NF1 gene.

By denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), Valero et al. (1994)
screened 70 unrelated NF1 patients for mutations in exons 29 and 31. Of
the 4 mutations that were identified, 3 consisted of C-to-T transitions
resulting in nonsense mutations: 2 in exon 29 (5242C-T; 613113.0004 and
5260C-T) and 1 in exon 31 (5839C-T). The fourth mutation consisted of a
2-bp deletion in exon 31, 5843delAA, resulting in a premature stop
codon. The 5839C-T mutation had previously been reported in 3
independent studies, suggesting that this position is a mutation hotspot
within the NF1 gene. It occurs in a CpG residue.

Heim et al. (1994) stated that although mutations had been sought in
several hundred NF1 patients, by August 1994, only 70 germline mutations
had been reported in a total of 78 individuals; only the R1947X
(613113.0012) mutation had been seen in as many as 6 unrelated patients.
NF1 mutations that had been identified included 14 large (more than 25
bp) deletions, 3 large insertions, 18 small (less than 25 bp) deletions,
8 small insertions, 6 nonsense mutations, 14 missense mutations, and 7
intronic mutations. At least 56 (80%) of the 70 mutations potentially
encode a truncated protein because of premature translation termination.

Abernathy et al. (1997) stated that about half of NF1 cases represent
new mutations and fewer than 100 constitutional mutations had been
reported. They used a combined heteroduplex/SSCP approach to search for
mutations in the NF1 gene in a set of 67 unrelated NF1 patients and
identified 26 mutations and/or variants in 45 of the 59 exons tested.
Disease-causing mutations were found in 19% (13 of 67) of cases studied.
The mutations included splice mutations, insertions, deletions, and
point changes.

Maynard et al. (1997) screened exon 16 of the NF1 gene in 465 unrelated
NF1 patients. Nine novel mutations were identified: 3 nonsense, 2
single-base deletions, 1 7-bp duplication, 2 missense, and 1 recurrent
splice site mutation. No mutations had been reported previously in exon
16, which is the largest exon (441 bp) of NF1. The previous absence of
mutation identification in exon 16 suggested to the authors that codons
in this region may have a lower propensity to mutate.

Stop, or nonsense, mutations can have a number of effects. In the case
of several genes, they affect mRNA metabolism and reduce the amount of
detectable mRNA. Also, in the NF1 gene, a correlation between a high
proportion of stop mutations and unequal expression of the 2 alleles is
demonstrable. A second, less common outcome is that mRNA containing a
nonsense mutation is translated and results in a truncated protein. A
third possible outcome is an abnormally spliced mRNA induced by a
premature-termination codon (PTC) in the skipped exon. This was
demonstrated in several disease genes, including the CFTR gene (Hull et
al., 1994) and the fibrillin gene (Dietz et al., 1993). Hoffmeyer et al.
(1998) characterized several stop mutations localized within a few
basepairs in exons 7 and 37 of the NF1 gene and noticed complete
skipping of either exon in some cases. Because skipping of exons 7 and
37 does not lead to a frameshift, premature termination codons are
avoided. Hoffmeyer et al. (1998) found that some other stop mutations in
the same general region did not lead to a skip. Calculations of
minimum-free-energy structures of the respective regions suggested that
both changes in the secondary structure of mRNA and creation or
disruption of exonic sequences relevant for the splicing process may in
fact cause these different splice phenomena observed in the NF1 gene.

Mutation analysis in NF1 has been hampered by the large size of the gene
(350 kb with 60 exons), the high rate of new mutations, lack of
mutational clustering, and the presence of numerous homologous loci.
Mutation detection methods based on the direct analysis of the RNA
transcript of the gene permit the rapid screening of large multiexonic
genes. However, detection of frameshift or nonsense mutations can be
limited by instability of the mutant mRNA species due to
nonsense-mediated decay. To determine the frequency of this allelic
exclusion, Osborn and Upadhyaya (1999) analyzed total lymphocyte RNA
from 15 NF1 patients with known truncation mutations and a panel of 40
NF1 patients with unknown mutations. The level of expression of the
mutant message was greatly reduced in 2 of the 15 samples (13%), and in
3 of the 18 informative samples from the panel of 40. A coupled RT-PCR
and protein truncation test method was subsequently applied to screen
RNA from the panel of 40 unrelated NF1 patients. Aberrant polypeptide
bands were identified and characterized in 21 samples (53%); each of
these had a different mutation. The mutations were uniformly distributed
across the gene, and 14 represented novel changes, providing further
information on the germline mutational spectrum of the NF1 gene.

The mutation rate in the NF1 gene is one of the highest known in humans,
with approximately 50% of all NF1 patients presenting with novel
mutations (review by Huson and Hughes, 1994). Despite the high frequency
of this disorder in all populations, relatively few mutations had been
identified at the molecular level, with most unique to 1 family. A
limited number of mutation 'hotspots' had been identified: R1947X in
exon 31 (613113.0012), and the 4-bp region between nucleotides 6789 and
6792 in exon 37, both implicated in about 2% of NF1 patients (review by
Upadhyaya and Cooper (1998)). Messiaen et al. (1999) identified another
mutation hotspot in exon 10b. By analyzing 232 unrelated NF1 patients,
they identified 9 mutations in exon 10b, indicating that this exon is
mutated in almost 4% of NF1 patients. Two mutations, Y489C (613113.0023)
and L508P (613113.0024), were recurrent, whereas the others were unique.
The authors suggested that since 10b shows the highest mutation rate of
any of the 60 NF1 exons, it should be given priority in mutation
analysis.

Fahsold et al. (2000) performed a mutation screen of the NF1 gene in
more than 500 unrelated patients with NF1. For each patient, the whole
coding sequence and all splice sites were studied for aberrations,
either by the protein truncation test (PTT), temperature-gradient gel
electrophoresis (TGGE) of genomic PCR products, or, most often, by
direct genomic sequencing of all individual exons. Of the variants
found, they concluded that 161 different ones were novel.
Mutation-detection efficiencies of the various screening methods were
similar: 47.1% for PTT, 53.7% for TGGE, and 54.9% for direct sequencing.
Of all sequence variants found, less than 20% represented C-to-T or
G-to-A transitions within a CpG dinucleotide, and only 6 different
mutations also occurred in NF1 pseudogenes, with 5 being typical C-to-T
transitions in a CpG. Thus, neither frequent deamination of
5-methylcytosines nor interchromosomal gene conversion can account for
the high mutation rate of the NF1 gene. As opposed to the truncating
mutations, the 28 (10.1%) missense or single-amino-acid-deletion
mutations identified clustered in 2 distinct regions, the GAP-related
domain and an upstream gene segment comprising exons 11 to 17. The
latter forms a so-called cysteine/serine-rich domain with 3 cysteine
pairs suggestive of ATP binding, as well as 3 potential cAMP-dependent
protein kinase recognition sites obviously phosphorylated by PKA.
Coincidence of mutated amino acids and those conserved between human and
Drosophila strongly suggested significant functional relevance of this
region, with major roles played by exons 12a and 15 and part of exon 16.

Ars et al. (2000) applied a whole NF1 cDNA screening methodology to the
study of 80 unrelated NF1 patients and identified 44 different
mutations, 32 being novel, in 52 of the patients. Mutations were
detected in 87% of the familial cases and in 51% of the sporadic ones.
At least 15 of the 80 NF1 patients (19%) had recurrence of a previously
observed mutation. The study showed that in 50% of the patients in whom
the mutations were identified, these resulted in splicing alterations.
Most of the splicing mutations did not involve the conserved AG/GT
dinucleotides of the donor and acceptor splice sites. One frameshift, 2
nonsense, and 2 missense mutations were also responsible for alterations
in mRNA splicing. Location and type of mutation within the NF1 gene and
its putative effect at the protein level did not indicate any
relationship to any specific clinical feature of NF1. The high
proportion of aberrant spliced transcripts detected in NF1 patients
stressed the importance of studying mutations at both the genomic and
RNA level. Ars et al. (2000) raised the possibility that part of the
clinical variability in NF1 is related to mutations affecting mRNA
splicing, which is the most common molecular defect in NF1.

Messiaen et al. (2000) studied 67 unrelated NF1 patients fulfilling the
NIH diagnostic criteria (Stumpf et al., 1988; Gutmann et al., 1997), 29
familial and 38 sporadic cases, using a cascade of complementary
techniques. They performed a protein truncation test starting from
puromycin-treated EBV cell lines and, if no mutation was found,
continued with heteroduplex, FISH, Southern blot, and cytogenetic
analysis. The authors identified the germline mutation in 64 of 67
patients, and 32 of the mutations were novel. The mutation spectrum
consisted of 25 nonsense, 12 frameshift, 19 splice mutations, 6 missense
and/or small in-frame deletions, 1 deletion of the entire NF1 gene, and
a translocation t(14;17)(q32;q11.2). Their data suggested that exons
10a-10c and 37 are mutation-rich regions and that together with some
recurrent mutations they may account for almost 30% of the mutations in
classic NF1 patients. Messiaen et al. (2000) found a high frequency of
unusual splice mutations outside of the AG/GT 5-prime and 3-prime splice
sites. As some of these mutations formed stable transcripts, it remained
possible that a truncated neurofibromin was formed.

Skuse and Cappione (1997) reviewed the possible molecular basis of the
wide clinical variability in NF1 observed even among affected members of
the same family (Huson et al., 1989). The complexities of alternative
splicing and RNA editing may be involved. Skuse and Cappione (1997)
suggested that the classical 2-hit model for tumor suppressor
inactivation used to explain NF1 tumorigenesis can be expanded to
include post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate NF1 gene
expression. Aberrations in these mechanisms may play a role in the
observed clinical variability.

Eisenbarth et al. (2000) described a systematic approach of searching
for somatic inactivation of the NF1 gene in neurofibromas. In the course
of these studies, they identified 2 novel intragenic polymorphisms: a
tetranucleotide repeat and a 21-bp duplication. Among 7 neurofibromas
from 4 different NF1 patients, they detected 3 tumor-specific point
mutations and 2 LOH events. The results suggested that small subtle
mutations occur with similar frequency to that of LOH in benign
neurofibromas and that somatic inactivation of the NF1 gene is a general
event in these tumors. Eisenbarth et al. (2000) concluded that the
spectrum of somatic mutations occurring in various tumors from
individual NF1 patients may contribute to the understanding of variable
expressivity of the NF1 phenotype.

Klose et al. (1998) identified a novel missense mutation in the NF1 gene
(R1276P; 613113.0022) in a patient with a classic multisymptomatic NF1
phenotype, including a malignant schwannoma. The mutation specifically
abolished the Ras-GTPase-activating function of neurofibromin. The
authors suggested that therapeutic approaches aimed at the reduction of
the Ras-GTP levels in neural crest-derived cells may relieve NF1
symptoms.

Kluwe et al. (1999) stated that plexiform neurofibroma can be found in
about 30% of NF1 patients, often causing severe clinical symptoms. They
examined 14 such tumors from 10 NF1 patients for loss of heterozygosity
at the NF1 gene using 4 intragenic polymorphic markers. LOH was found in
8 tumors from 5 patients, and was suspected in 1 additional tumor from
another patient. They interpreted these findings as suggesting that loss
of the second allele, and thus inactivation of both alleles of the NF1
gene, is associated with the development of plexiform neurofibromas. The
14 plexiform neurofibromas were also examined for mutation in the TP53
gene; no mutations were found.

Faravelli et al. (1999) reported a family in which 7 members developed
brain tumors which in 4 were confirmed as gliomas. Three of these
individuals had a clinical history strongly suggestive of NF1. Two
individuals with very mild features of NF1 insufficient to meet
diagnostic criteria carried a splice site mutation in intron 29 of the
NF1 gene, creating a frameshift and premature protein termination.
Faravelli et al. (1999) noted the unusually high incidence of brain
tumors in this family with the NF1 phenotype and suggested that some
cases of familial glioma may be explained by mutations in the NF1 gene.

Kluwe et al. (2003) examined 20 patients with spinal tumors from 17
families for clinical symptoms associated with NF1 and for NF1
mutations. Typical NF1 features were found in 12 patients from 11
families. Typical NF1 mutations were found in 10 of the 11 index
patients in this group, including 8 truncating mutations, 1 missense
mutation, and 1 deletion of the entire NF1 gene. Eight patients from 6
families had no or only a few additional NF1-associated symptoms besides
multiple spinal tumors, which were distributed symmetrically in all
cases and affected all 38 nerve roots in 6 patients. Only mild NF1
mutations were found in 4 of the 6 index patients in the latter group,
including 1 splicing mutation, 2 missense mutations, and 1 nonsense
mutation in exon 47 at the 3-prime end of the gene. The data indicated
that patients with spinal tumors can have various NF1 symptoms and NF1
mutations; however, patients with no or only a few additional NF1
symptoms may be a subgroup or may have a distinct form of NF1, probably
associated with milder NF1 mutations or other genetic alterations.

The underestimates of NF1 gene mutations in neurofibromatosis type I
have been attributed to the large size of the NF1 gene, the considerable
frequency of gross deletions, and the common occurrence of splicing
defects that are only detectable by cDNA analysis. A number of splicing
errors do not affect the canonical GT splice donor or AG splice
acceptor, or create novel splice sites, but may exert their effect by
means of an altered interaction between an exonic splice enhancer (ESE)
and mRNA splicing factors (Messiaen et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2001).
Colapietro et al. (2003) reported skipping of exon 7 and sequence
alterations in ESEs in a patient with severe NF1 (613113.0036).

The analysis of somatic NF1 gene mutations in neurofibromas from NF1
patients shows that each neurofibroma results from an individual second
hit mutation; thus, factors that influence somatic mutation rates may be
regarded as potential modifiers of NF1. Wiest et al. (2003) performed a
mutation screen of numerous neurofibromas from 2 NF1 patients and found
a predominance of point mutations, small deletions, and insertions as
second hit mutations in both patients. Seven novel mutations were
reported. Together with the results of studies that showed LOH as the
predominant second hit in neurofibromas of other patients, these results
suggest that in different patients different factors may influence the
somatic mutation rate and thereby the severity of the disease.

Not only can mutations in nucleotides at the ends of introns result in
abnormalities of splicing, but nonsense, missense, and even
translationally silent mutations have been shown to cause exon skipping.
The analysis of individual mutations of this kind can shed light on
basic pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms. Using cDNA-based mutation detection
analysis, Zatkova et al. (2004) identified 1 missense and 6 nonsense
mutations (e.g., 613113.0042) that lead to different extents of
exon-lacking transcripts in NF1 patients. They confirmed
mutation-associated exon skipping in a heterologous hybrid minigene
context. Because of evidence that the disruption of functional ESE
sequences is frequently the mechanism underlying mutation-associated
exon skipping, Zatkova et al. (2004) examined the wildtype and mutant
NF1 sequences with 2 available ESE prediction programs. Either or both
programs predicted the disruption of ESE motifs in 6 of the 7 analyzed
mutations. To ascertain the function of the predicted ESEs, Zatkova et
al. (2004) quantitatively measured their ability to rescue splicing of
an enhancer-dependent exon, and found that all 7 mutant ESEs had reduced
splicing enhancement activity compared to the wildtype sequences. The
results suggested that the wildtype sequences function as ESE elements,
whose disruption is responsible for the mutation-associated exon
skipping observed in NF1 patients. Furthermore, this study illustrated
the utility of ESE prediction programs for delineating candidate
sequences that may serve as ESE elements.

In a girl with aniridia (106210), microphthalmia, microcephaly, and
cafe-au-lait macules, Henderson et al. (2007) identified heterozygous
mutations in the PAX6 (R38W; 607108.0026), NF1 (R192X; 613113.0046), and
OTX2 (Y179X; 600037.0004) genes. Her mother, who carried the NF1 and
PAX6 mutations, had NF1 with typical eye defects; in addition, although
her eyes were of normal size, she had small corneas, and also had
cataracts, optic nerve hypoplasia, nystagmus, and mild iris stromal
hypoplasia with normal-sized pupils. The proband's father, who had
multiple ocular defects (MCOPS5; 610125), had previously been studied by
Ragge et al. (2005) and was heterozygous for the OTX2 nonsense mutation.
Henderson et al. (2007) noted that the proband's phenotype was
surprisingly mild, given that mutations in PAX6, OTX2, or NF1 can cause
a variety of severe developmental defects.

Sabbagh et al. (2009) examined the phenotypic correlations between
affected relatives in 750 NF1 patients from 275 multiplex families
collected through the NF-France Network. Twelve NF1-related clinical
features, including 5 quantitative traits (number of cafe-au-lait spots
of small size and of large size, and number of cutaneous, subcutaneous,
and plexiform neurofibromas) and 7 binary ones, were scored. All
clinical features studied, with the exception of neoplasms, showed
significant familial aggregation after adjusting for age and sex. For
most of them, patterns of familial correlations indicated a strong
genetic component with no apparent influence of the constitutional NF1
mutation. Heritability estimates of the 5 quantitative traits ranged
from 0.26 to 0.62. Nine tag SNPs in NF1 were genotyped in 1,132
individuals from 313 NF1 families. No significant deviations of
transmission of any of the NF1 variants to affected offspring was found
for any of the 12 clinical features examined, based on single marker or
haplotype analysis. Sabbagh et al. (2009) concluded that genetic
modifiers, unlinked to the NF1 locus, contribute to the variable
expressivity of the disease.

- Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785) is a pediatric
myelodysplastic syndrome that is associated with neurofibromatosis type
I. The NF1 gene regulates the growth of immature myeloid cells by
accelerating guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis on RAS proteins. Side et
al. (1998) undertook a study to determine if the NF1 gene is involved in
the pathogenesis of JMML in children without a clinical diagnosis of
NF1. An in vitro transcription and translation system was used to screen
JMML marrows from 20 children for NF1 mutations that resulted in a
truncated protein. SSCP analysis was used to detect RAS point mutations
in these samples. Side et al. (1998) confirmed mutations of NF1 in 3
cases of JMML, 1 of which also showed loss of the normal NF1 allele. An
NF1 mutation was detected in normal tissue from the only patient tested,
suggesting that JMML may be the presenting feature of NF1 in some
children. Activating RAS mutations were found in 4 patients; as
expected, none of these samples harbored NF1 mutations. Because 10 to
14% of children with JMML had a clinical diagnosis of NF1, these data
were consistent with the existence of NF1 mutations in approximately 30%
of JMML cases.

The risk of malignant myeloid disorders in young children with NF1 is
200 to 500 times the normal risk. Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by
the NF1 gene, negatively regulates signals transduced by Ras proteins.
Genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that NF1 functions
as a tumor-suppressor gene in immature myeloid cells. This hypothesis
was further supported by the demonstration by Side et al. (1997) that
both NF1 alleles were inactivated in bone marrow cells from children
with NF1 complicated by malignant myeloid disorders. Using an in vitro
transcription and translation system, they screened bone marrow samples
from 18 such children for NF1 mutations that cause a truncated protein.
Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from the
patients, and from the affected parents in cases of familial NF1. Side
et al. (1997) found that the normal NF1 allele was absent in bone marrow
samples from 5 of 8 children who had truncating mutations of the NF1
gene.

- Neurofibromatosis-Noonan Syndrome

The overlap syndrome neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (601321) shows
features of both disorders, as was first noted by Allanson et al.
(1985). Colley et al. (1996) examined 94 sequentially identified
patients with NF1 from their genetic register and found Noonan features
in 12. Carey et al. (1997) identified a 3-bp deletion of exon 17 of the
NF1 gene in a family with NFNS (613113.0033). Stevenson et al. (2006)
provided a follow-up of this family. Baralle et al. (2003) identified
mutations in the NF1 gene in 2 patients with the overlap syndrome
(613113.0034 and 613113.0035).

Bertola et al. (2005) provided molecular evidence of the concurrence of
neurofibromatosis and Noonan syndrome in a patient with a de novo
missense mutation in the NF1 gene (613113.0043) and a mutation in the
PTPN11 gene (176876.0023) inherited from her father. The proposita was
noted to have cafe-au-lait spots at birth. Valvar and infundibular
pulmonary stenosis and aortic coarctation were diagnosed at 20 months of
age and surgically corrected at 3 years of age. As illustrated, the
patient had marked hypertelorism and proptosis as well as freckling and
cafe-au-lait spots. Lisch nodules were present. At the age of 8 years, a
pilocytic astrocytoma in the suprasellar region involving the optic
chiasm (first presenting symptomatically at 2 years of age), was
partially resected. The father, who was diagnosed with Noonan syndrome,
had downslanting palpebral fissures and prominent nasal labial folds. He
was of short stature (159 cm) and had pectus excavatum.
Electrocardiogram showed left-anterior hemiblock and complete right
bundle branch block.

In a study of 17 unrelated subjects with NFNS, De Luca et al. (2005)
found NF1 gene defects in 16. Remarkably, there was a high prevalence of
in-frame defects affecting exons 24 and 25, which encode a portion of
the GAP-related domain. No defect was observed in PTPN11 (176876), which
is the usual site of mutations causing classic Noonan syndrome. De Luca
et al. (2005) stated that including their study, 18 distinct NF1 gene
mutations had been described in 22 unrelated patients with NFNS.

- Watson Syndrome

Watson syndrome (193520) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized
by pulmonic stenosis, cafe-au-lait spots, decreased intellectual
ability, and short stature. Most affected individuals have relative
macrocephaly and Lisch nodules and about one-third of those affected
have neurofibromas. Because of clinical similarities between Watson
syndrome and neurofibromatosis, Allanson et al. (1991) performed linkage
studies in families with Watson syndrome, using probes known to flank
the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, and found tight linkage. In a patient
with Watson syndrome, Upadhyaya et al. (1992) identified an 80-kb
deletion in the NF1 gene (613113.0011). Tassabehji et al. (1993)
demonstrated an almost perfect in-frame tandem duplication of 42 bases
in exon 28 of the NF1 gene in 3 members of a family with Watson syndrome
(613113.0010).

- Spinal Neurofibromatosis

In all 5 affected members of 3-generation family with spinal
neurofibromatosis (162210) and cafe-au-lait spots, Ars et al. (1998)
identified a frameshift mutation in the NF1 gene (613113.0018).

In affected members of 2 families with spinal neurofibromas but no
cafe-au-lait macules, Kaufmann et al. (2001) identified 2 different
mutations in the NF1 gene (613113.0028 and 613113.0029, respectively).
Both NF1 mutations caused a reduction in neurofibromin of approximately
50%, with no truncated protein present in the cells. The findings
demonstrated that typical NF1 null mutations can result in a phenotype
that is distinct from classic NF1, showing only a small spectrum of the
NF1 symptoms, such as multiple spinal tumors, but not completely fitting
the current clinical criteria for spinal NF.

- Role in Cancer

Desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma (DNM) is an uncommon melanoma subtype
that shares morphologic characteristics with nerve sheath tumors. For
that reason, Gutzmer et al. (2000) analyzed 15 DNMs and 20 melanomas
without morphologic features of desmoplasia or neuroid differentiation
(i.e., common melanomas) for LOH at the NF1 locus and flanking regions.
Allelic loss was detected in 10 of 15 (67%) DNMs but in only 1 of 20
(5%) common melanomas. LOH was most frequently observed at marker IVS38,
located in intron 38 of NF1. These data suggested a role for NF1 in the
pathogenesis of DNM and supported the hypothesis that exon 37 may encode
a functional domain.

The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2008) reported the interim
integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression, and DNA
methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas and nucleotide sequence
alterations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. The RTK/RAS/PI3K signaling
pathway was altered in 88% of glioblastomas. NF1 was found to be an
important gene in glioblastoma, with mutation or homozygous deletion of
the NF1 gene present in 18% of tumors.

ANIMAL MODEL

See 162200 for a discussion of animal models of neurofibromatosis type
I.

Ruiz-Lozano and Chien (2003) commented on how it is possible to apply
Cre-loxP technology to track the cardiac morphogenic signals mediated by
neurofibromin. A growing list of mouse lines that express Cre in
specific cardiovascular cell lineages was available.

Gene transcription may be regulated by remote enhancer or insulator
regions through chromosome looping. Using a modification of chromosome
conformation capture and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ling et al.
(2006) found that 1 allele of the Igf2 (147470)/H19 (103280) imprinting
control region (ICR) on mouse chromosome 7 colocalized with 1 allele of
Wsb1 (610091)/Nf1 on chromosome 17. Omission of CCCTC-binding factor
(CTCF; 604167) or deletion of the maternal ICR abrogated this
association and altered Wsb1/Nf1 gene expression. Ling et al. (2006)
concluded that CTCF mediates an interchromosomal association, perhaps by
directing distant DNA segments to a common transcription factory, and
the data provided a model for long-range allele-specific associations
between gene regions on different chromosomes that suggested a framework
for DNA recombination and RNA trans-splicing.

To investigate the function of NF1 in skeletal development, Kolanczyk et
al. (2007) created mice with Nf1 knockout directed to undifferentiated
mesenchymal cells of developing limbs. Inactivation of Nf1 in limbs
resulted in bowing of the tibia, diminished growth, abnormal
vascularization of skeletal tissues, and fusion of the hip joints and
other joint abnormalities. Tibial bowing was caused by decreased
stability of the cortical bone due to a high degree of porosity,
decreased stiffness, and reduction in the mineral content, as well as
hyperosteoidosis. Accordingly, cultured osteoblasts showed increased
proliferation and decreased ability to differentiate and mineralize. The
reduced growth in Nf1-knockout mice was due to reduced proliferation and
differentiation of chondrocytes.

HISTORY

Gervasini et al. (2002) reported a direct tandem duplication of the NF1
gene identified in 17q11.2 by high-resolution FISH. FISH on stretched
chromosomes with locus-specific probes revealed the duplication of the
NF1 gene from the promoter to the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR), but
with at least the absence of exon 22. Duplication was probably present
in the human-chimpanzee-gorilla common ancestor, as demonstrated by the
finding of the duplicated NF1 gene at orthologous chromosome loci. The
authors suggested that the NF1 intrachromosomal duplication may
contribute to the high whole-gene mutation rate by gene conversion. In
contrast to the findings of Gervasini et al. (2002), however,
Kehrer-Sawatzki et al. (2002) studied a female NF1 patient with
reciprocal translocation t(17;22)(q11.2; q11.2) and determined that
there is a single NF1 gene in the 17q11.2 region. Kehrer-Sawatzki and
Messiaen (2003) analyzed another reciprocal translocation, a
t(14;17)(q32;q11.2), described in a large family with NF1, which
disrupted the NF1 gene (Messiaen et al., 2000) and again reported
findings inconsistent with a duplication of the NF1 gene at 17q11.2 as
proposed by Gervasini et al. (2002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ALU INS

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; 162200), Wallace et al.
(1991) demonstrated a de novo heterozygous Alu repetitive element
insertion into an intron of the NF1 gene, which resulted in deletion of
the downstream exon during splicing and consequently shifted the reading
frame. The patient was an isolated case in his family. The insertion,
300-500 bp, began 44 bp upstream of exon 6. This previously undescribed
mechanism of mutation indicated that Alu retrotransposition is an
ongoing process in the human germline. Alu elements had been involved in
the generation of disease mutation by recombination (e.g., in familial
hypercholesterolemia (143890) and ADA deficiency) or point mutation
(e.g., in gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina 258870; 613349.0023),
but not as a new element.

.0002
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 5-BP DEL

In 2 patients with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), a 35-year-old man
and his daughter, Stark et al. (1991) demonstrated a 5-bp deletion
(CCACC or CACCT) and an adjacent transversion, located about 500 bp
downstream from the region that codes for a functional domain of the NF1
gene product. The mutation was demonstrable by heteroduplex analysis.
The deletion removed the proximal half of a small potential stem-loop
and interrupted the reading frame in exon 1. A severely truncated
protein with a grossly altered carboxy terminus lacking one-third of its
sequence was the predicted consequence. Stark et al. (1992) found that
both alleles were expressed in primary cultures of neurofibroma cells
and melanocytes from a cafe-au-lait macule of the proband, thus
excluding loss of heterozygosity. The authors used the 5-bp deletion for
the presymptomatic diagnosis of the 18-month-old third son of the
proband.

.0003
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, LEU348PRO

Cawthon et al. (1990) identified point mutations in a 4-kb sequence of
the transcript of the NF1 gene at a translocation breakpoint associated
with neurofibromatosis type I (162200). One mutant allele contained a
T-to-C transition that caused a leu348-to-pro (L348P) substitution, and
the second harbored a C-to-T insertion that changed an arg365 to a stop
codon (R365X; 613113.0004).

.0004
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG365TER

Independently, Cawthon et al. (1990) and Estivill et al. (1991)
identified a new mutation in exon 4 of the NF1 gene; a 1087C-T
transition (numbering of Cawthon et al., 1990), resulting in an
arg365-to-ter (R365X) substitution, in patients with neurofibromatosis I
(162200). Although a different numbering system was used, this is the
same mutation as that found by Valero et al. (1994) and designated
5242C-T in exon 29. They proposed that this site, in a CpG residue, is a
hotspot for mutation in the NF1 gene.

.0005
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, LYS1423GLU

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200) and affected members
of his family, Li et al. (1992) found an AAG-to-GAG transition at codon
1423, resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid for lysine
(K1423E).

The same mutation or a mutation in the same codon leading to
substitution of glutamine for lysine through an A-to-C transversion was
also observed by Li et al. (1992) as a somatic mutation in
adenocarcinoma of the colon, myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic
astrocytoma.

.0006
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 1-BP INS, 5662C

In 2 unrelated patients with type I neurofibromatosis (162200),
Upadhyaya et al. (1992) found insertion of a cytosine within codon 1818
that changed the reading frame and resulted in 23 altered amino acids
prior to the inappropriate introduction of a stop codon at amino acid
1841. The insertion created a recognition site for enzyme MnlI. (The
authors incorrectly stated in their abstract and the legend of their
Figure 3 that there was a nucleotide insertion at 'codon 5662.' The
nucleotide insertion at residue 5662 occurs within codon 1818 in their
cDNA clone of NF1, as correctly represented in the sequence shown in
their Figure 3.)

.0007
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 1-BP INS, FS1841TER

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Upadhyaya et al.
(1992) found an insertion of thymidine in codon 1823, resulting in a
shift of the reading frame, the generation of 18 amino acids different
from those of the normal protein, and a gene product that terminated
prematurely at amino acid 1840 by the creation of a stop codon at 1841.

.0008
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, LEU2143MET

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Upadhyaya et al.
(1992) found a heterozygous 6639C-A transversion in the NF1 gene,
resulting in a leu2143-to-met (L2143M) substitution.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, TYR2213ASN

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Upadhyaya et al.
(1992) found a heterozygous 6724T-G transversion in the NF1 gene,
resulting in a tyr2213-to-asn (Y2213N) substitution.

WATSON SYNDROME
NF1, 42-BP DUP

In a family in which Watson syndrome (193520) had occurred in 3
generations, Tassabehji et al. (1993) demonstrated an almost perfect
in-frame tandem duplication of 42 bases in exon 28 of the NF1 gene.
Unlike the mutations previously described in classic NF1 which result
predominantly in null alleles, the mutation in this family would be
expected to result in a mutant neurofibromin product. The affected
mother had multiple cafe-au-lait patches, freckling in the axillary and
groin, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, a squint, and an IQ of 56. She
had no Lisch nodules or neurofibromata. A daughter, aged 3.5 years, had
multiple cafe-au-lait spots, mild pectus carinatum, hypertelorism with
epicanthic folds, a squint, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and
moderate global developmental delay. Her twin brother had ptosis, mild
cubitus valgus, bilateral undescended testes, and mild pulmonic valvular
stenosis by echocardiography. Neither child had Lisch nodules or
neurofibromata.

WATSON SYNDROME
NF1, 80-KB DEL

Upadhyaya et al. (1992) found an 80-kb deletion at the NF1 locus in a
patient with Watson syndrome (193520).

.0012
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG1947TER

A C-to-T transition changing arginine-1947 to a stop codon (R1947X) in
the NF1 gene has been described in multiple Caucasian and Japanese
families with neurofibromatosis I (162200), suggesting that this codon,
CGA, is a hotspot for mutation, presumably because it contains a CpG
dinucleotide. (Numbering of codons is based on Marchuk et al. (1991).)
The mutation was described in 3 unrelated Caucasians (Ainsworth et al.,
1993; Cawthon et al., 1990; Estivill et al., 1991); at least 2 of these
cases were sporadic. Horiuchi et al. (1994) reported the same mutation
in 2 unrelated familial cases of NF1. That these represented independent
mutations was indicated by the fact that in the 2 families the affected
individuals differed with regard to a polymorphism located within the
NF1 gene. The frequency of the arg1947-to-ter mutation may be as high as
8% in Japanese and at least 1% in Caucasians. Studying one of the
patients with the arg1947-to-ter mutation, Horiuchi et al. (1994) showed
that both the normal and the mutant allele were transcribed in a
lymphoblastoid cell line.

Heim et al. (1994) referred to the arg1947-to-ter mutation as having
been identified in 6 unrelated patients with NF1.

Lazaro et al. (1995) presented 2 further cases of the arg1947-to-ter
mutation in the NF1 gene. They stated that a total of 9 cases of the
R1947X mutation had been reported, giving a frequency of about 2%. The
mutation occurs within a CpG dinucleotide. They developed an
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization assay for the efficient
screening of a large number of samples for this relatively common
recurrent mutation.

In a sample of 56 unrelated Korean patients with NF1, Park et al. (2000)
identified 1 with the R1947X mutation.

.0013
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, IVS18DS, G-A, +1

Purandare et al. (1995) identified a G-to-A transition at position +1 of
intron 18 of the NF1 gene in a 41-year-old Caucasian female in whom the
diagnosis of neurofibromatosis (162200) was first made at the age of 28
years when she was admitted to hospital for a grand mal seizure. A son
was also affected. The mutation resulted in skipping of exon 18 which
did not cause a shift in the reading frame but resulted in an in-frame
loss of 123 nucleotides from the mRNA and the corresponding 41 amino
acids from the protein. Purandare et al. (1995) referred to 3 previously
reported splice donor site mutations in the NF1 gene.

.0014
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 2-BP DEL, 1541AG

The arg1947-to-ter mutation (613113.0012) is one of the few recurrent
mutations found in the NF1 gene but is not a frequent recurrence, having
been found in only 6 of 363 patients with NF1 (162200). Robinson et al.
(1996) described a recurrent 2-bp deletion in exon 10c of the NF1 gene
in 2 unrelated patients: one sporadic and another familial case. The
mutation was designated 1541delAG by the authors.

.0015
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, MET1035ARG

Wu et al. (1996) suggested that some patients diagnosed with LEOPARD
syndrome (151100) may have a mutation in the NF1 gene, whereas others
may have a mutation in a different gene. They found a de novo M1035R
missense mutation resulting from a T-to-G transversion in exon 18 of the
NF1 gene in a 32-year-old woman with a prior diagnosis of LEOPARD
syndrome, who was found to have NF1 (162200). At birth, a heart murmur
was detected resulting from subvalvular muscular aortic stenosis and
valvular aortic stenosis. The skin showed multiple dark lentigines
together with a few larger cafe-au-lait patches. The same lentigines
were present in the armpits and groin and were not raised. The patient
attended a special school for mildly mentally retarded children. At the
age of 21 years, mitral insufficiency was demonstrated resulting from a
double orifice mitral valve. The patient had macrocrania (head
circumference 58 cm), apparent hypertelorism, and a coarse face with
broad neck. Neurofibromas were not present at the age of 32, and no
Lisch nodules were seen by slit-lamp examination. The mutation was
absent in the parents, who were clinically normal.

.0016
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG1391SER

Upadhyaya et al. (1997) identified 14 novel mutations in the GAP-related
domain of neurofibromin in patients with neurofibromatosis I (162200).
One of these mutations was a change at nucleotide 4173 from A to T,
changing codon 1391 from AGA (arg) to AGT (ser) (R1391S). The effect of
this R1391S missense mutation was studied by in vitro expression of a
site-directed mutant and by GAP activity assay. The mutant protein was
found to be some 300-fold less active than wildtype NF1 protein.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, FAMILIAL SPINAL
NF1, 1-BP INS, 8042A

In 5 affected members of a family with spinal neurofibromatosis with
cafe-au-lait macules (162210), Ars et al. (1998) identified a 1-bp
insertion (8042insA) in exon 46 of the NF1 gene. The mutation was
predicted to result in a truncated protein.

.0019
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC
NF1, TRP1538TER

Among 20 children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785),
Side et al. (1998) found 3 with truncating mutations in the NF1 gene.
One of the children, a 3-year-old boy, had a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 4614, which converted codon 1538 from tryptophan to stop in
exon 27a (W1538X).

.0020
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC
NF1, IVS34, G-A, +18

In a 19-month-old boy with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML/Mo7;
607785), Side et al. (1998) found in cloned cDNA aberrant splicing
resulting in a shift in the reading frame. Genomic DNA showed an
alteration (6579,G-A,+18) in the splice donor consensus sequence
flanking exon 34. This mutation introduced an additional 17 nucleotides
containing a novel BglI restriction enzyme site into the patient's cDNA.
Side et al. (1998) identified this restriction site in amplified cDNA
derived from the patient's EBV cell line RNA, thus confirming that this
mutation existed in the germline. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity
was demonstrated, indicating inactivation of another NF1 allele.

.0021
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC
NF1, IVS11, A-G, -8

In a 6-month-old boy with JMML (607785), Side et al. (1998) described a
splice mutation. Cloned cDNA showed abnormal splicing of 7 nucleotides
between exons 10c and 11. They had previously found the same mutation in
a child with familial NF1 and myelodysplasia syndrome (Side et al.
(1997)); genomic DNA sequence showed an abnormal splice acceptor
sequence upstream of exon 11 (1642,A-G,-8) creating a cryptic splice
site and consequent frameshift and premature stop codon at codon 555.

.0022
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG1276PRO

In a family with a classic multisymptomatic NF1 phenotype (162200),
including a malignant schwannoma, Klose et al. (1998) found an
arg1276-to-pro (R1276P) mutation in the arginine finger of the
GAP-related domain (GRD) of the neurofibromin gene, resulting in
disruption of the most essential catalytic element for Ras-GAP activity.
Klose et al. (1998) presented data demonstrating that the R1276P
mutation, unlike previously reported missense mutations of the GRD
region, did not impair the secondary and tertiary protein structure. It
neither reduced the level of cellular neurofibromin nor influenced its
binding to Ras substantially, but it did completely disable GAP
activity. The findings provided direct evidence that failure of
neurofibromin GAP activity is a critical element in NF1 pathogenesis.
The findings suggested that therapeutic approaches aimed at the
reduction of the Ras-GTP levels in neural crest-derived cells can be
expected to relieve most of the NF1 symptoms. The proband was the first
child of unaffected, nonconsanguineous parents. She developed multiple
cafe-au-lait spots within the first year of life. Her language and motor
development were mildly retarded, and she complained of incoordination
throughout life. Around puberty, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas
developed which worsened at the time of each of her 3 pregnancies. At
the age of 31 years, routine MRI of the brain revealed multiple areas of
increased T2 signal intensity in the midbrain and a small optic glioma.
Because of recurrent paresthesias in her left leg, an MRI scan of the
spine was done 2 years later which revealed multiple schwannomas within
the vertebral foramina. The largest tumor in the lumbar region, with a
volume of approximately 8 ml, was surgically removed. Histologically,
there was no evidence of malignancy at that time. Eight months later,
the patient suffered a relapse with rapid tumor growth. At the time of
reoperation, the retroperitoneal tumor had reached a volume of 800 ml
and showed numerous necrotic and anaplastic areas with a proliferation
rate up to 60%. The patient died of widespread metastatic disease at the
age of 34 years. Her 3 male children, ages 4, 8, and 12 years, all
fulfilled the NF1 diagnostic criteria. The 2 elder sons were
macrocephalic. Language and motor development of all children was
retarded to a similar extent and on the same time scale as in their
mother. A cranial MRI scan in the 2 elder brothers showed increased T2
signal intensities similar to those in their mother.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, TYR489CYS

Among the 9 NF1 exon 10b mutations identified by Messiaen et al. (1999)
in 232 unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis I (162200), 2 were
recurrent: an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1466, resulting in a
tyr489-to-cys substitution (Y489C), and a T-to-C transition at
nucleotide 1523, resulting in a leu508-to-pro substitution (L508P;
613113.0024). The Y489C mutation caused skipping of the last 62
nucleotides of exon 10b, while the L508P mutation was undetectable by
the protein truncation test.

NF1, IVS9DS, G-A, +1

In a patient with type I neurofibromatosis (162200), Eisenbarth et al.
(2000) identified a germline G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1260+1, the
splice donor site of intron 9 of the NF1 gene, leading to the inclusion
of 13 bp of intervening sequence into the NF1 messenger. The mutant
allele was present in all tissues tested. In a neurofibroma from this
patient, an additional C-to-T transition at nucleotide 4021
(613113.0026), a presumed 'second hit' somatic mutation, was identified.
Another neurofibroma from the same patient showed a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 4084 (613113.0027), a presumed further 'second hit' somatic
mutation. Both somatic mutations led to premature stop codons in the NF1
message.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, FAMILIAL SPINAL
NF1, LEU2067PRO

In a patient with spinal neurofibromatosis but without cafe-au-lait
macules (162210), Kaufmann et al. (2001) identified a leu2067-to-pro
(L2067P) mutation in exon 33 of the NF1 gene. Her clinically unaffected
61-year-old father had the same NF1 mutation in his blood cells.
Additional molecular investigations to exclude mosaicism were not
feasible and additional clinical investigations through MRI scans could
not be performed. The L2067P mutation yielded an unstable product of
approximately 50% normal neurofibromin levels, indicating functional
haploinsufficiency.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, FAMILIAL SPINAL, INCLUDED
NF1, IVS31, A-G, -5

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Fahsold et al.
(2000) identified an A-to-G transition in the NF1 gene splice acceptor
site of exon 31 (IVS31-5A-G), resulting in the addition of 4 bases to
exon 32 and a premature stop codon at amino acid 1995.

In affected members of a family with spinal neurofibromatosis without
cafe-au-lait macules (162210), Kaufmann et al. (2001) identified the
exon 31 splice site mutation. Noting that the same mutation had been
reported in a patient with classic NF1, the authors concluded that a
modifying gene may compensate for some of the effects of neurofibromin
deficiency. The splice site NF1 mutation resulted in instability of the
neurofibromin protein.

.0030
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, DEL

Upadhyaya et al. (2003) described a Portuguese family in which 3 members
had clinical features of NF1 (162200) and each had a different
underlying defect in the NF1 gene. A 12-year-old boy who had multiple
cafe-au-lait spots on his trunk and legs as well as developmental delay
had a heterozygous 1.5-Mb deletion including the entire NF1 gene. The
mutation was associated with the maternally derived chromosomal
haplotype. His 10-year-old brother, who exhibited multiple cafe-au-lait
spots and macrocephaly but whose development was within the normal
range, was heterozygous for a CGA-to-TGA transition in exon 22 of the
NF1 gene, resulting in an arg1241-to-ter mutation (613113.0031). This
mutation had previously been described; its recurrence was thought to
have been mediated by 5-methylcytosine deamination because it occurred
in a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide. The brothers' 26-year-old female
first cousin once removed (a first cousin of their father) exhibited
multiple cafe-au-lait spots, bilateral Lisch nodules, and multiple
dermal neurofibromas. She also showed severe scoliosis and several
plexiform neurofibromas in the clavicular region, but her development
was within the normal range. She was found to carry a frameshift
mutation, 5406insT (613113.0032), in exon 29 of the NF1 gene. None of
the parents had any clinical evidence of NF1 and none had a mutation in
the NF1 gene. There was also no evidence of mosaicism. Upadhyaya et al.
(2003) speculated about the mechanism of this unusual situation.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS-NOONAN SYNDROME
WATSON SYNDROME, INCLUDED
NF1, 3-BP DEL, 2970AAT

Carey et al. (1997) described a 3-bp deletion in exon 17 of the NF1 gene
in affected members of a family with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome
(601321). The 2970delAAT mutation resulted in deletion of met991. The
clinical features of the 3 subjects were tabulated by De Luca et al.
(2005). Stevenson et al. (2006) reported a follow-up of this family.

Upadhyaya et al. (2007) reported this mutation in 47 affected
individuals from 21 unrelated families with a similar phenotype, lacking
cutaneous neurofibromas or clinically obvious plexiform neurofibromas.
One of the families had been reported by Stevenson et al. (2006);
another was reported by Castle et al. (2003) and had a diagnosis of
Watson syndrome (193520). The in-frame 3-bp deletion in exon 17 was
predicted to result in the loss of 1 of 2 adjacent methionines, either
codon 991 or codon 992, in conjunction with a silent ACA-to-ACG change
of codon 990. These 2 methionine residues are located in a highly
conserved region of neurofibromin and are expected, therefore, to have a
functional role in the protein. This was said to have been the first
study to correlate a specific small mutation of the NF1 gene with the
expression of a particular clinical phenotype.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS-NOONAN SYNDROME
NF1, 3-BP DEL, 4312GAA

In a patient with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (601321), Baralle et
al. (2003) identified a 3-bp deletion, 4312delGAA, in exon 25 of the NF1
gene. The patient was a 6-year-old boy with more than 6 cafe-au-lait
macules. There were no other features of neurofibromatosis type I, but
his mother had a single cafe-au-lait macule and Lisch nodules, low
hairline, and short neck. He had ptosis, epicanthal folds, low posterior
hairline, and low-set ears. On echocardiogram he had pulmonic stenosis.
No neurofibromas were present.

NF1, 2-BP INS, 4095TG

In a patient with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (601321), Baralle et
al. (2003) identified a 2-bp insertion, 4095insTG, in exon 23-2 of the
NF1 gene. The patient was a 20-year-old man with 7 cafe-au-lait macules,
axillary freckling, 10 neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, and scoliosis with
a structural cervical vertebral abnormality. He had downslanting
palpebral fissures, ptosis, a short, broad neck, widely spaced nipples,
and an atrial septal defect. He was of short stature and needed extra
help in mainstream school. There was no family history of similar
findings.

.0036
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1
NF1, 20075G-A, 20076C-A

In a patient with severe neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Colapietro
et al. (2003) found a G-to-A transition and a C-to-A transversion at
nucleotide positions 57 and 58, respectively, of the 154-bp long NF1
exon 7, neither of which was present in the proband's parents or 50
healthy controls. RT-PCR analysis showed the expected fragment from exon
4b to 8 together with a shortened one with in-frame skipping of exon 7.
Direct sequencing of genomic DNA revealed 2 exonic heterozygous changes
at nucleotides 20075 (G-A transition) and 20076 (C-A transversion),
which belong to contiguous codons. The first substitution occurred in
the third base of the codon, changing it from CAG to CAA, both encoding
glutamine (Q315Q); the second changed the CTG codon for leucine to the
ATG codon for methionine (L316M). The use of previously established
sequence matrices for the scoring of putative ESE motifs showed that the
adjacent silent and missense mutations were located within highly
conserved overlapping stretches of 7 nucleotides with a close similarity
to the ESE-specific consensus sequences recognized by the SC35 (600813)
and SF2/ASF (600812) arginine/serine-rich (SR) proteins. The combined
occurrence of both consecutive alterations decreased the motif score for
both SR proteins below their threshold levels. As the aberrant
transcript was consistently expressed, a protein lacking 58 amino acids
was predicted. Thus, the contiguous internal exon 7 mutations appear to
have caused exon 7 skipping as a result of the missplicing caused by
abrogation of functional ESEs (see Cartegni et al. (2002) and
Fairbrother et al. (2002)). The male proband in the study of Colapietro
et al. (2003) was the third child of healthy unrelated parents. At the
age of 1 year, he underwent uronephrectomy because of right renal
dysplasia. At the age of 3 years, an optic glioma was identified and
surgically excised. The diagnosis of NF1 was made when he was 9 years
old on the basis of the presence of cafe-au-lait spots, optic glioma,
and Lisch nodules of the iris. Cerebral MRI at the age of 11 years
revealed multiple hamartomas and a right hemisphere cerebral venous
angioma. The patient showed borderline mental retardation, a height in
the 10th percentile, and an occipitofrontal head circumference in the
97th percentile. At the age of 20 years, he showed macrocephaly,
numerous cafe-au-lait spots, small cutaneous neurofibromas, a plexiform
neck neurofibroma, and axillary and inguinal freckling. Scoliosis,
winged scapulae, and bilateral genu valgum were also present.

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Maris et al. (2002)
identified a 1-bp deletion in the NF1 gene, 3775delT. The mutation was
not present in the patient's parents.

Mosse et al. (2004) showed that the patient originally described by
Maris et al. (2002) was also affected with neuroblastoma (256700) and
Hirschsprung disease (142623), which were caused by a 1-bp deletion in
the PHOX2B gene (676delG; 603851.0007).

identified a 1-bp deletion (4071delC) in exon 23.2 of the NF1 gene,
resulting in a premature stop codon. The deletion was predicted to
generate a truncated neurofibromin of 1,383 amino acids. Neuroimaging
studies showed the presence of multiple spinal nerve root neurofibromas.
A high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) had been
removed from the left iliac fossa previously, with no recurrence. Benign
flexiform neurofibroma was present in the left abdominal wall.

By cDNA-based mutation detection analysis, Zatkova et al. (2004) studied
7 nonsense or missense alleles of NF1 that caused exon skipping and
showed that disruption of exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) elements was
responsible. One of the 7 mutations was a novel nonsense mutation, a
5719G-T transversion, resulting in a glu1904-to-ter (G1904X)
substitution in exon 30. The phenotype was NF1 (162200).

de novo mutation in the NF1 gene and a mutation in the PTPN11 gene
(176876.0023) inherited from her father. The NF1 mutation was a 2531A-G
transition resulting in a leu844-to-arg substitution. The proband had
pulmonary stenosis and aortic coarctation requiring surgery and also had
a pilocytic astrocytoma in the suprasellar region involving the optic
chiasm and forming the third ventricle. She had cafe-au-lait spots and
axillary freckling typical of neurofibromatosis and marked hypertelorism
characteristic of Noonan syndrome.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, IVS27DS, G-C, +1

In a mother and son with a mild form of NF1 (162200), Thiel et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous mutation (4661+1G-C) in intron 27 of
the NF1 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 27a and potentially
affecting the GAP-related domain. Both patients had cafe-au-lait spots
and mild myopia, but no neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, or optic gliomas.
The daughter of the mother, who also carried the NF1 mutation, was found
to be compound heterozygous with a mutation in the PTPN11 gene (T2I;
176876.0027). In addition to features of neurofibromatosis I, she also
had features of Noonan syndrome (163950), including hypertelorism,
low-set ears, poor growth, sternal deformity, valvular pulmonic
stenosis, and delayed development. The PTPN11 mutation was predicted to
destabilize the inactive form of PTPN11, resulting in increased basal
activity and a gain of function. The girl also developed bilateral optic
gliomas before age 2 years, which may be explained by an additive effect
of both the NF1 and PTPN11 mutations on the Ras pathway. Compound
heterozygosity for mutations in NF1 and PTPN11 were also reported by
Bertola et al. (2005) in a patient with a combination of
neurofibromatosis I and Noonan syndrome.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS-NOONAN SYNDROME
NF1, LEU1390PHE

In affected members of a 5-generation family with
neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (601321), Nystrom et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 4168C-T transition in exon 24 of the NF1 gene,
resulting in a leu1390-to-phe (L1390F) substitution in the highly
conserved GAP-related domain. The family was originally reported by
Edman Ahlbom et al. (1995) as having Noonan syndrome based on dysmorphic
facial features, short stature, pulmonary stenosis, and short neck. Upon
reevaluation, Nystrom et al. (2009) found that several family members
had cafe-au-lait spots, axillary freckling, Lisch nodules, and multiple
nevi, consistent with NF1, but that all family members lacked dermal and
superficial plexiform neurofibromas. The authors concluded that the
clinical diagnosis was consistent with NFNS. Nystrom et al. (2009)
postulated that the L1390F mutation resulted in impaired GTPase
activity.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG192TER

In a girl with aniridia (106210), microphthalmia, microcephaly, and
cafe-au-lait macules, Henderson et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity
for a 574C-T transition in exon 4b of the NF1 gene, resulting in an
arg192-to-ter (R192X) substitution, as well as heterozygous mutations in
the PAX6 (R38W; 607108.0026) and OTX2 (Y179X; 600037.0004) genes. Her
mother, who carried the NF1 and PAX6 mutations, had NF1 with the typical
eye defects of retinal fibroma, optic nerve glioma, and gross Lisch
nodules on the iris; in addition, although her eyes were of normal size,
she had eyes were of normal size, she had small corneas, and also had
cataracts, optic nerve hypoplasia, nystagmus, and mild iris stromal
hypoplasia with normal-sized pupils. The proband's father, who had
multiple ocular defects (MCOPS5; 610125), had previously been studied by
Ragge et al. (2005) and was heterozygous for the OTX2 nonsense mutation.
Henderson et al. (2007) noted that the proband's phenotype was
surprisingly mild, given that mutations in PAX6, OTX2, or NF1 can cause
a variety of severe developmental defects.

602313	TITLE *602313 OVO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE, 1; OVOL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A critical role in Drosophila oogenesis and germline sex differentiation
is played by ovo, a female germline-specific nuclear protein.
Chidambaram et al. (1997) noted that homozygous ovo mutants result in
female germ cell degeneration and revertants of dominant ovo mutations
can result in shaven baby (svb) and lozenge-like (lzl) phenotypes that
affect cuticle (epidermal/locomotor) and eye (sensory) development,
respectively, suggesting a tight structural link between ovo and svb.
Human OVOL1, which contains an open reading frame with zinc finger
domains, is similar to Drosophila ovo and is conserved in C. elegans as
well. An EST database search suggested the presence of ovo-related
sequences in both the mouse and the human genome.

MAPPING

The human OVOL1 gene maps to 11q13, less than 200 kb proximal to the
oncogene SEA (165110) (Debelenko et al., 1997). Comparative mapping data
indicated that the mouse Ovol1 locus is located on MMU 19.
