603491	TITLE *603491 IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 3; IGSF3
DESCRIPTION Saupe et al. (1998) isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like membrane protein, named immunoglobulin
superfamily member-3 (IGSF3). The deduced 1,215-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a large extracellular
domain composed of 8 Ig-like domains with 7 potential N-glycosylation
sites; a potential hydrophobic transmembrane domain; and a C-terminal
charged cytoplasmic tail. The Ig-like domains are of the V type, and a
search of the sequence databases revealed that the IGSF3 protein is 32%
identical to human V7 (604516), a leukocyte surface protein. The authors
detected a major 8-kb mRNA and minor 6- and 4-kb mRNA species in a
variety of human tissues by Northern blot analysis.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analyses,
Saupe et al. (1998) localized the human IGSF3 gene to 1p13 and
demonstrated the presence of related sequences on chromosomes 2 and 13.
