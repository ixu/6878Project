CLONING

Kao et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding NF45 and NF90. The NF90 gene
encodes a 671-amino acid polypeptide with limited similarity to several
RNA-binding proteins. The NF90 gene also appears to encode an
alternatively spliced 404-amino acid polypeptide, of which the first 394
amino acids are identical to the longer clone. Northern and Western blot
analysis demonstrated NF45 and NF90 expression in several cell types,
including both unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells.

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA library for phosphoproteins,
Matsumoto-Taniura et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA encoding ILF3,
which they termed MPP4. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that MPP4
encodes 90- and 110-kD proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression during M phase and nuclear/nucleolar
expression during interphase.

Patel et al. (1999) purified double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding
proteins from HeLa cell extracts and microsequenced a 90-kD protein with
identity to MPP4 in its N terminus. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with a
mutant RNA-activated protein kinase (PRKR; 176871) as bait, followed by
RT-PCR, they isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ILF3, which they
called DRBP76. Sequence analysis predicted that the 702-amino acid
protein has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, 2 dsRNA-binding
domains, an RG2 domain, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 90-kD protein, larger than the
calculated 76 kD. EMSA analysis confirmed the dsRNA binding activity of
DRBP76. Autoradiographic analysis indicated that DRBP76 is
phosphorylated by PRKR.

Langland et al. (1999) noted that NF90 is primarily localized to
ribosomes.

Saunders et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding DRBP76, which they
termed NFAR1, as well as a variant cDNA encoding a 110-kD, 894-amino
acid protein they designated NFAR2. Sequence analysis showed that the
NFAR proteins share homology with a known PRKR substrate, the
translation initiation factor EIF2S1 (603907). Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression of multiple transcripts ranging from 4.0
to 8.0 kb. Immunoblot analysis indicated variable expression with lower
amounts particularly notable in liver and spleen, suggesting
differential regulation at the translational or posttranslational level.
Immunoblot analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated that PRKR and
both NFAR variants reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize in
the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated an association with
spliceosomes.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified splice variants of human and mouse
ILF3 that encode long and short isoforms of the ILF3 and NF90 proteins
via inclusion or exclusion of 13 N-terminal residues, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1994) showed that the NF45 and NF90 proteins form an NFAT
DNA-binding activity that is enhanced by T-cell stimulation and
inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506.

Functional analysis by Saunders et al. (2001) indicated that both NFAR
proteins regulate gene transcription, probably at the level of mRNA
elongation. NFAR2 exhibited potent, constitutive regulatory activity
through its unique C-terminal region, which specifically interacted with
FUS (137070) and SMN1 (600354). Saunders et al. (2001) concluded that
NFARs facilitate dsRNA-regulated gene expression at the level of
posttranscription.

Shim et al. (2002) showed that NF90 binds to a subregion of the 3-prime
untranslated region that contains several AU-rich elements (AREs) and
slows down the degradation of IL2 (147680) mRNA. In nonstimulated cells,
NF90 was mostly nuclear, but T-cell activation resulted in its
accumulation in the cytoplasm. The authors concluded that nuclear export
of NF90 is required for IL2 mRNA stabilization.

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that NFAR1 and NFAR2 were involved in
retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and could regulate
mRNA export to the cytoplasm. They also remained associated with
exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Treatment of HeLa cells with small
interfering RNA to NFAR1 and/or NFAR2 resulted in an increase in protein
synthesis rates, particularly in the presence the mRNA export factors
TAP (NXF1; 602647), p15 (NXT1; 605811), or RAE1 (603343). Depletion of
NFAR in mouse fibroblasts or HeLa cells dramatically increased their
susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus,
respectively. Pfeifer et al. (2008) concluded that NFAR1 and NFAR2 are
retained on polyribosomes and act to govern translation rates, and that
they also play a role in innate immune defense to virus infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Saunders et al. (2001) determined that the
NFAR gene contains 21 exons and spans 16.2 kb. The 90-kD NFAR1 variant
expresses exon 18, which contains several stop codons that lead to
termination at amino acid 702. The 110-kD NFAR2 variant lacks exon 18
but contains exons 19, 20, and 21.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified an additional alternatively spliced
exon within intron 2 of the mouse and human ILF3 genes, increasing the
total number of exons to 22.

MAPPING

Saunders et al. (2001) mapped the NFAR gene to chromosome 19p13 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that mice lacking Nfar died in utero.

102680	TITLE *102680 ADDUCIN 1; ADD1
;;ADDUCIN, ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adducin is a 200-kD heterodimeric protein associated with the
erythrocyte membrane skeleton, which binds to Ca(2+)/calmodulin (see
114180), promotes binding of spectrin to actin, and is a substrate for
protein kinases C and A (Gardner and Bennett, 1986; Bennett et al.,
1988). The name adducin comes from the Latin 'adducere,' meaning 'to
bring together.'

CLONING

Adducin was first purified from human erythrocytes by Gardner and
Bennett (1986) and subsequently isolated from bovine brain membranes
(Bennett et al., 1988).

Joshi and Bennett (1990) investigated the structure and function of the
separate domains of alpha adducin. Joshi et al. (1991) isolated
reticulocyte cDNAs for alpha- and beta- (ADD2; 102681) adducin. The
deduced alpha-adducin protein contains 737 amino acids and shares
approximately 49% sequence identity with beta adducin, suggesting
evolution by gene duplication. Each adducin subunit has 3 distinct
domains: a 39-kD N-terminal globular protease-resistant domain,
connected by a 9-kD domain to a 33-kD C-terminal protease-sensitive tail
comprised almost entirely by hydrophilic amino acids. The head domains
of both alpha- and beta-adducin have limited sequence similarity with
the N-terminal actin-binding motif present in members of the spectrin
superfamily and actin gelation proteins. The C termini of both proteins
contain an identical 22-amino acid sequence showing similarity to the
MARCKS protein (177061). Northern blot analysis of rat tissues, K562
erythroleukemia cells, and reticulocytes demonstrated ubiquitous
expression of alpha adducin.

Goldberg et al. (1992) identified a 4-kb alpha-adducin transcript that
was abundantly expressed in the caudate nucleus, the site of major
neuronal loss in Huntington disease (HD; 143100). No sequence
alterations specific to HD were discovered in sequencing the brain
alpha-adducin cDNA from 2 HD patients and an age-matched control. Brain
cDNA from both patients and controls showed 2 alternately spliced brain
exons not previously described in erythrocyte cDNA.

In a comprehensive assay of gene expression, Gilligan et al. (1999)
showed the ubiquitous expression of alpha- and gamma-adducin (ADD3;
601568), in contrast to the restricted expression of beta-adducin.
Beta-adducin was expressed at high levels in brain and hematopoietic
tissues (bone marrow in humans, spleen in mice).

See Gilligan and Bennett (1993) for a review of adducin and the other
components of the junctional complex of the cell membrane skeleton.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Joshi et al. (1991) provisionally
assigned the ADD1 gene to chromosome 4 and the ADD2 gene to chromosome
2. Both alpha- and beta-adducin show alternative splicing; thus, there
may be several different heterodimeric or homodimeric forms of adducin,
each with a different functional specificity.

Using the technique of 'exon trapping' devised by Buckler et al. (1991),
Taylor et al. (1992) identified exons corresponding to the alpha subunit
of adducin within the 4p16.3 region where Huntington disease appeared to
be located. They mapped the ADD1 gene immediately telomeric to D4S95.

Goldberg et al. (1992) reported the isolation and cloning of cDNA for
the brain alpha-adducin gene, which they found to be located within 20
kb of D4S95.

Nasir et al. (1994) used an interspecific backcross to map the mouse
Add1 gene to chromosome 5, within the region of syntenic homology with
the short arm of human chromosome 4. Grosson et al. (1994) also mapped
the mouse Add1 gene to chromosome 5 in a continuous linkage group that
included the Huntington disease homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Kuhlman et al. (1996) found that purified human erythrocyte adducin
completely blocked elongation and depolymerization at the fast-growing
barbed ends of actin filaments in vitro, thus functioning as a barbed
end capping protein. This barbed end capping activity required the
intact adducin molecule and was downregulated by calmodulin in the
presence of calcium. Kuhlman et al. (1996) concluded that adducin
restricts actin filament length in erythrocytes.

To investigate the molecular involvement of alpha-adducin in controlling
Na/K pump activity, Torielli et al. (2008) transfected wildtype or
mutated rat and human ADD1 into several renal cell lines and
demonstrated that the rat and human mutated forms increased Na/K pump
activity and the number of pump units; both variants
coimmunoprecipitated with the Na/K pump. The increased pump activity was
not due to changes in its basolateral location, but to an alteration of
Na/K pump residential time on the plasma membrane. Both the rat and
human mutated variants reduced constitutive Na/K pump endocytosis and
similarly affected transferrin receptor (190010) trafficking and
fluid-phase endocytosis. Alpha-adducin was also detected in clathrin
(see 118955)-coated vesicles and coimmunoprecipitated with clathrin.
Torielli et al. (2008) suggested that adducin, in addition to having
modulatory effects on actin cytoskeleton dynamics, might play a direct
role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and that the constitutive
reduction of Na/K pump endocytic rate induced by mutated adducin
variants might be relevant in sodium-dependent hypertension (see
145500).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a case-control study involving 190 patients with primary hypertension
and 126 controls, Casari et al. (1995) found an association between
essential hypertension (see 145500) and allelic markers near the
alpha-adducin locus.

Cusi et al. (1997) found significant linkage of the alpha-adducin locus
to essential hypertension and greater sensitivity to changes in sodium
balance among patients with a particular ADD1 allele, trp460
(102680.0001), suggesting that alpha adducin is associated with a
salt-sensitive form of essential hypertension.

Manunta et al. (1998) analyzed the pressure-natriuresis relationship in
108 hypertensive individuals and found that patients with a G/W or W/W
ADD1 genotype showed lower plasma renin activity and fractional
excretion of sodium as well as reduced slope of the pressure-natriuresis
relationship after sodium depletion or sodium loading compared to G/G
patients. These findings supported the hypothesis that individuals with
at least 1 ADD1 460W allele have increased renal tubular sodium
reabsorption.

Using endogenous lithium and uric acid as markers of proximal tubular
sodium reabsorption, Manunta et al. (1999) investigated the relationship
between renal sodium handling and ADD1 polymorphism in untreated
hypertensive patients and found that adducin genotype was significantly
and directly related to the fractional excretion of lithium. Manunta et
al. (1999) concluded that ADD1 represents a 'renal hypertensive gene'
that modulates the capacity of tubular epithelial cells to transport
sodium and thus affects blood pressure levels.

Allayee et al. (2001) performed a genomewide scan for blood pressure in
18 Dutch families exhibiting the common lipid disorder familial combined
hyperlipidemia (144250). They found a locus on chromosome 4 that
exhibited a significant lod score of 3.9 for systolic blood pressure. In
addition, this locus appeared to influence plasma free fatty acid levels
(lod = 2.4). After adjustment for age and gender, the lod score for
systolic blood pressure increased to 4.6, whereas the lod score for free
fatty acid levels did not change. Allayee et al. (2001) tested for an
association between 2 intragenic ADD1 polymorphisms and systolic blood
pressure in this sample and found none.

Lanzani et al. (2005) examined the association between polymorphisms in
the ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3 genes (G460W, C1797T, and IVS11+386A-G,
respectively) and ambulatory blood pressure and plasma levels of renin
activity and endogenous ouabain in 512 newly discovered and
never-treated hypertensive patients. Relative to carriers of the
wildtype (G/G) ADD1 gene, carriers of the mutant 460W allele had higher
blood pressure and lower plasma renin activity and endogenous ouabain
levels. Polymorphisms in the ADD2 and ADD3 genes taken alone were not
associated with these variables, but the blood pressure difference
between the 2 ADD1 genotypes was greatest in carriers of the ADD3 G
allele (increased by approximately 8 mm Hg; p = 0.020 to 0.006,
depending on the genetic model applied). The authors suggested that
there were epistatic effects between the ADD1 and ADD3 loci affecting
variation in blood pressure.

ANIMAL MODEL

The Milan hypertensive strain of rats develops a genetic form of renal
hypertension that, when compared to its normotensive control, shows
renal dysfunction similar to that of a subset of human patients with
primary hypertension. Bianchi et al. (1994) showed that 1 point mutation
in each of the 2 genes coding for adducin is associated with blood
pressure level in this strain of rats. The hypertensive and normal rats
differed, respectively, by the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine at
position 316 of the alpha subunit; at the beta-adducin locus, the
hypertensive strain was always homozygous for arginine at position 529,
while the normal strain showed either arginine or glutamine in that
position. The arg/gln heterozygotes showed lower blood pressure than any
of the homozygotes. In vitro phosphorylation studies suggested that both
of these amino acid substitutions occurred within protein kinase
recognition sites. Analysis of an F2 generation demonstrated that Y
(tyrosine) alleles segregated with a significant increment in blood
pressure. This effect was modulated by the presence of the R (arginine)
allele of the beta subunit. Bianchi et al. (1994) stated that, taken
together, these findings strongly supported a role for adducin
polymorphisms in causing variation of blood pressure in the Milan strain
of rats. In the rat, the beta- and alpha-adducin genes were said to be
located on chromosomes 4 and 14, respectively.

Tripodi et al. (1996) studied the effects of the Milan hypertensive rat
316Y and 529R mutations in Add1 and Add2, respectively, on actin
polymerization and bundling in a cell-free system and found that
double-mutated adducin exerted only a slight inhibitory effect with a
much higher final extent of polymerization compared to wildtype. Adducin
heterodimer mutated only in the beta subunit behaved as normal adducin,
whereas adducin heterodimer mutated only in the alpha subunit exhibited
an intermediate phenotype, consistent with the associated levels of
blood pressure previously described by Bianchi et al. (1994). Studies of
the actin cytoskeleton in transfected rat kidney epithelial cell lines
showed that cells overexpressing the mutated alpha-adducin chain
exhibited larger microfilament bundles and larger focal contacts with
patchy aggregates of alpha-v integrin (193210), compared to cells
overexpressing wildtype adducin, in which the microfilament bundles were
organized in a much looser texture and alpha-v integrin was present in a
diffuse punctate pattern with small focal contacts. The surface
expression of the Na-K pump alpha subunit was considerably increased in
cells overexpressing the mutated alpha-adducin chain, and Na-K pump
activity at V(max) was increased with respect to normal transfected
lines and untransfected cells. Tripodi et al. (1996) suggested that
adducin has a role in the constitutive capacity of the renal epithelia
both to transport ions and to expose adhesion molecules.

Efendiev et al. (2004) studied Milan rats carrying the hypertensive
adducin phenotype and observed higher renal tubule Na/K-ATPase activity
and found that their Na/K-ATPase molecules did not undergo endocytosis
in response to dopamine like those of normotensive rats. In the
hypertensive rats, dopamine failed to promote the interaction between
adaptins (see 601026) and the Na/K-ATPase, required for endocytosis,
because of adaptin-mu-2 subunit (602296) hyperphosphorylation.
Expression of the hypertensive rat or human variant of ADD1 into normal
renal epithelial cells recreated the hypertensive phenotype with higher
Na/K-ATPase activity, mu-2-subunit hyperphosphorylation, and impaired
Na/K-ATPase endocytosis. The authors concluded that increased renal
Na/K-ATPase activity and altered sodium reabsorption in certain forms of
hypertension could be attributed to a mutant form of adducin that
impairs the dynamic regulation of renal Na/K-ATPase endocytosis in
response to natriuretic signals.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERTENSION, SALT-SENSITIVE ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ADD1, GLY460TRP

Cusi et al. (1997) found a significant association between a
gly460-to-trp polymorphism (G460W) in the ADD1 gene and salt sensitivity
in patients with essential hypertension (see 145500). Patients with the
W460 allele showed greater sensitivity to changes in sodium balance, and
heterozygous hypertensive patients (G/W) showed a greater fall in mean
arterial pressure in response to 2 months' treatment with
hydrochlorothiazide, than did wildtype homozygous (G/G) hypertensive
patients. In controls in an Italian cohort, the G460 allele had a
frequency of 86.4% and the W460 allele 13.6%.

Manunta et al. (1998) analyzed the pressure-natriuresis relationship in
108 hypertensive individuals, 80 of whom were wildtype homozygous (G/G),
26 G/W heterozygous, and 2 W/W homozygous. At baseline, the G/W and W/W
patients showed lower plasma renin activity and fractional excretion of
sodium; these patients also had reduced slope of the
pressure-natriuresis relationship after sodium depletion or sodium
loading compared to G/G patients. These findings supported the
hypothesis that individuals with at least 1 ADD1 460W allele have
increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.

Using endogenous lithium and uric acid as markers of proximal tubular
sodium reabsorption, Manunta et al. (1999) investigated the relationship
between renal sodium handling and ADD1 polymorphism in 54 untreated
hypertensive patients, 29 with the G/G genotype and 25 with the G/W
genotype. Fractional excretions of lithium and uric acid were
significantly decreased in G/W patients compared to G/G patients;
multiple regression analysis showed that adducin genotype was
significantly and directly related to the fractional excretion of
lithium. Manunta et al. (1999) concluded that ADD1 represents a 'renal
hypertensive gene' that modulates the capacity of tubular epithelial
cells to transport sodium and thus affects blood pressure levels.

607672	TITLE *607672 CARDIOTROPHIN-LIKE CYTOKINE FACTOR 1; CLCF1
;;CLC;;
B-CELL STIMULATORY FACTOR 3; BSF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLCF1 belongs to the interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) family of cytokines,
which are involved in cell signaling through phosphorylation of gp130
(IL6ST; 600694). IL6 family members share similarity in gene structure
and have a 4-helix bundle in their protein structure.

CLONING

Senaldi et al. (1999) cloned BSF3, which they also referred to as novel
neurotrophin-1 (NNT1), by subtractive hybridization using a cDNA library
prepared from phorbol ester-activated Jurkat T cells. The deduced
protein contains 225 amino acids, including a 27-amino acid signal
peptide. The mature form is predicted to be a 198-amino acid peptide
with a molecular mass of 22 kD. BSF3 contains 4 cysteine residues, 2 of
which are in the signal peptide, and 1 potential N-linked glycosylation
site. The secondary structure is predicted to contain alpha helices.
BSF3 shares 19 to 27% homology with other IL6 family members and 96%
homology with mouse Bsf3. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.2-kb
transcript expressed predominantly in lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral
blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
of mouse tissues revealed strongest expression in lymph nodes, spleen,
liver, lung, uterus, and ovary. N-terminal amino acid analysis of BSF3
expressed in HEK293 cells confirmed removal of the signal peptide.

Using cardiotrophin-1 (CTF1; 600435) as query in a database search, Shi
et al. (1999) identified a full-length clone of CLC. CLC shares 29%
identity with CTF1 and 20 to 26% identity with other neuropoietic
cytokines. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb transcript expressed
at high levels in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, at moderate
levels in ovary, placenta, and kidney, and at low levels in colon,
heart, lung, and pancreas. The transcript in lung was slightly smaller
than that in other tissues. Shi et al. (1999) also detected CLC clones
in cDNA libraries prepared from activated or resting neutrophils, bone
marrow stromal cells, and synovial fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Senaldi et al. (1999) found that treatment of human neuroblastoma cells
with recombinant BSF3 resulted in phosphorylation of gp130, LIFR-beta
(151443), and STAT3 (102582). BSF3 supported the survival of chick
embryo motor and sympathetic neurons in culture in a dose-dependent
manner and induced growth of murine myeloid leukemia cells. Treatment of
mice with recombinant BSF3 increased the level of serum amyloid A
(104750), potentiated the induction of corticosterone and IL6 by IL1
(see 147760), and caused body weight loss and B-cell hyperplasia with
elevated serum IgG and IgM levels.

Shi et al. (1999) found that recombinant CLC induced the activation of
NFKB (see 164011) and SRE reporter constructs in several mammalian cell
lines. The signal transduction pathway for CLC was characterized in a
neuroblastoma cell line, and tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 and STAT1
(600555), but not STAT3, was detected.

GENE STRUCTURE

Senaldi et al. (1999) determined that the CLCF1 gene contains 3 exons
and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an Australian man with cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS2;
610313), Rousseau et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for a
truncating (607672.0001) and a missense mutation (607672.0002) in the
CLCF1 gene. The mutations were not found in 140 control chromosomes.

In 2 Hungarian sisters with CISS2, Hahn et al. (2010) identified
compound heterozygous mutations in the CLCF1 gene (607672.0003 and
607672.0004).

MAPPING

By FISH, Senaldi et al. (1999) mapped the CLCF1 gene to chromosome
11q13. By radiation hybrid analysis, Shi et al. (1999) mapped the CLCF1
gene to chromosome 11q13.3.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 2
CLCF1, TYR107TER

In an Australian man with cold-induced sweating syndrome-2 (CISS2;
610313), Rousseau et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for a
321C-A transversion and a 590G-T transversion in the CLCF1 gene,
resulting in a tyr107-to-ter (Y107X) and an arg197-to-leu (R197L;
607672.0002) substitution, respectively. The mutations were not found in
140 control chromosomes. Transfection studies demonstrated that
truncated CLC containing a stop codon at position 107 cannot be
correctly processed and expressed in mammalian cells. Functional studies
of R197L CLC revealed an incapacity for the mutant protein to bind to
CNTFR (118946) and activate subsequent signaling events; structural and
docking interaction studies showed that the R197L substitution
destabilized the contact site between CLC and CNTFR.

the CLCF1 gene: a 46T-C transition resulting in a cys16-to-arg (C16R)
substitution, and a 676T-C transition (607672.0004) resulting in the
extension of the terminal stop codon by 171 residues (X226ext171).

605301	TITLE *605301 TRANSFORMING, ACIDIC, COILED-COIL-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TACC1
TACC1/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Amplification of various chromosomal regions in human breast carcinomas
has lead to the identification of protooncogenes involved in
tumorigenesis. For example, MYC (190080) in 8q24, CCND1 (168461) in
11q13, and ERBB2 (164870) in 17q12 are each observed in 20% of all
breast tumors. Still et al. (1999) noted that 8p11 is amplified in 10 to
15% of breast tumor samples but the only gene assigned to this region,
FGFR1 (136350), is typically expressed at the same levels in normal and
tumor breast tissue. By PCR analysis with primers obtained from an EST
database, generation of a BAC contig spanning 380 kb of the 8p11 breast
cancer amplicon-1, and probing fetal tissue libraries, Still et al.
(1999) isolated a cDNA encoding TACC1. The predicted 805-amino acid
TACC1 protein is rich in serine, proline, and acidic residues, has a
20-amino acid N terminus rich in tryptophan, contains 2 nuclear
localization signals but no DNA- or RNA-binding domains, and has a
200-residue C terminus with extensive alpha-helical segments expected to
adopt a coiled-coil structure. Northern blot analysis detected a major
8.0-kb TACC1 transcript in all tissues tested, with relatively weak
expression in liver and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Still et al. (1999) found that introduction of TACC1 into stable cell
lines resulted in morphologic changes consistent with a transformed
phenotype and in anchorage-independent growth.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Lauffart et al.
(2002) showed that TACC1 interacted with C-terminal regions of CHTOG
(CKAP5; 611142) and GAS41 (YEATS4; 602116).

During neurogenesis, the nuclei of progenitor cells of the proliferative
ventricular zone oscillate in a cell cycle-dependent manner called
interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). In most cell types, the nucleus
closely follows the centrosome during migration; however, in neural
progenitors, centrosomes remain near the ventricular zone during INM.
Xie et al. (2007) showed that INM in mice was dependent on the
regulation of centrosome-associated microtubules by Cep120 (613446) and
Taccs. Cep120 and Taccs regulated the integrity of microtubules coupling
the centrosome and the nucleus. Cep120 interacted with Taccs and
regulated the localization of Tacc3 (605303) to the centrosome. Both
Cep120 and Taccs were essential for maintaining the neural progenitor
pool during mouse neocortical development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Singh et al. (2012) reported that a small subset of glioblastoma
multiforme tumors (GBMs; 137800) (3.1%; 3 of 97 tumors examined) harbors
oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine
kinase coding domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes
FGFR1 (136350) or FGFR3 (134934) to the transforming acidic coiled-coil
(TACC) coding domains of TACC1 or TACC3 (605303), respectively. The
FGFR-TACC fusion protein displayed oncogenic activity when introduced
into astrocytes or stereotactically transduced in the mouse brain. The
fusion protein, which localizes to mitotic spindle poles, has
constitutive kinase activity and induces mitotic and chromosomal
segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Inhibition of FGFR kinase
corrected the aneuploidy, and oral administration of an FGFR inhibitor
prolonged survival of mice harboring intracranial FGFR3-TACC3-initiated
glioma. Singh et al. (2012) concluded that FGFR-TACC fusions could
potentially identify a subset of GBM patients who would benefit from
targeted FGFR kinase inhibition.

606101	TITLE *606101 EGF-LIKE MODULE-CONTAINING, MUCIN-LIKE HORMONE RECEPTOR 3; EMR3
DESCRIPTION Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-7-transmembrane (TM7) proteins are
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) found on monocytes and neutrophils.
They include mouse F4/80, mouse and human CD97 (601211), and EMR1
(600493), the likely human homolog of F4/80. EGF-TM7 glycoproteins have
variable numbers of N-terminal EGF-like repeats coupled to a family-B
GPCR-related moiety via a mucin-like stalk.

CLONING

By searching DNA databases, using 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, and
screening a spleen cDNA library, Stacey et al. (2001) identified cDNAs
encoding EMR2 (606100), EMR3, and splice variants of each. The deduced
652-amino acid EMR3 protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 2
EGF-like domains, the first of which does not contain a calcium-binding
sequence, a mucin-like spacer region with several N- and O-linked
glycosylation sites, a putative GPCR proteolytic site, a TM7 region, and
a 51-residue cytoplasmic tail. A truncated EMR3 splice variant
containing only the 2 EGF-like domains and no transmembrane domain was
predicted to be a soluble protein. Northern blot analysis of tissues and
RT-PCR analysis of cell lines revealed that expression of 2.4- and
4.0-kb EMR3 transcripts was restricted to leukocytes. Flow cytometric
screening demonstrated that EMR3, but not EMR2, interacts with
monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils activated with fMLP but not
with CD55 (125240), the CD97 ligand. Stacey et al. (2001) noted that
EMR3 and EMR2 share a high degree of sequence identity in the TM domains
but not in the extracellular domains, whereas EMR2 and CD97 are highly
homologous in the EGF-like domains but not in the transmembrane domains,
suggesting different ligand-binding and intracellular signaling
activities.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Stacey et al. (2001) mapped the EMR3 gene
to 19p13.1, close to the other EGF-TM7 genes.
