612911	TITLE *612911 NADH DEHYDROGENASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, ASSEMBLY FACTOR 3; NDUFAF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hartmann and Stamm (1997) cloned rat Ndufaf3, which they called E3-3,
and identified the human ortholog by EST database analysis. RT-PCR
detected E3-3 expression in all rat tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis.

Using human SOB1 (AKAP3; 604689) in a low-stringency screen of a mouse
germinal cell cDNA library, Hammami-Hamza et al. (2003) cloned mouse
Ndufaf3, which they called 2P1. Northern blot analysis detected
expression only in mouse testis. In situ hybridization detected 2P1 in
stage I pachytene spermatocytes, and expression persisted until stage
XII of the spermatogenic cycle. No expression was detected in
interstitial tissue.

Saada et al. (2009) stated that the NDUFAF3 gene encodes 2 isoforms, A
and B, which share a 'domain of unknown function' (DUF498). The longer A
isoform harbors a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence
of about 35 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

The NDUFAF3 gene contains 4 exons (Saada et al., 2009).

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the NDUFAF3 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the NDUFAF3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL049955) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

GENE FUNCTION

Using subcellular fractionation experiments, Saada et al. (2009) showed
that NDUFAF3 was predominantly localized to mitochondria and remained in
the pellet after carbonate extraction, suggesting a strong interaction
with the mitochondrial membrane, although NDUFAF3 has no predicted
transmembrane helices. Localization appeared identical to that of
NDUFAF4 (611776). RNA interference studies indicated that the NDUFAF3
gene product is necessary for mitochondrial complex I assembly. The
activity of NDUFAF3 showed functional interdependence with NDUFAF4. Gene
conservation analysis linked NDUFAF3 to the bacterial-membrane-insertion
gene cluster SecF/SecD/YajC and C8ORF38 (612392), suggesting a
translation-dependent early assembly mechanism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010)
and lactic acidosis, Saada et al. (2009) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the NDUFAF3 gene
(612911.0001-612911.0003). All patients died before age 6 months.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, GLY77ARG

In 3 Muslim sibs with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010)
resulting in death by age 3 months, Saada et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 229G-C transversion in the NDUFAF3 gene, resulting in a
gly77-to-arg (G77R) substitution. The parents were consanguineous.

.0002
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, ARG122PRO

In a male infant with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency
(252010), Saada et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 365G-C
transversion in the NDUFAF3 gene, resulting in an arg122-to-pro (R122P)
substitution at the C-terminal end of the protein. The child was born of
consanguineous Arab Muslim parents. At 3 weeks of age, he became
hypoactive and sucked poorly. Physical examination revealed
macrocephaly, a weak cry, wide anterior fontanel, and axial hypotonia.
He had intermittent generalized tonic movements, and funduscopy showed
pallor of the optic discs. At 3 months of age, there was no eye contact
and marked axial hypotonia with brisk tendon reflexes. He died at age 4
months.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, MET1THR

In a female infant with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency
(252010), Saada et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the NDUFAF3 gene: a 2T-C transition, resulting in a
met1-to-thr (M1T) substitution, and the R122P (612911.0002) mutation.
She was the daughter of unrelated parents of Jewish origin. At age 3
months, she developed myoclonic seizures, and brain MRI revealed diffuse
brain leukomalacia. She died at age 6 months of respiratory failure.
Complex I activity was markedly decreased.

600008	TITLE *600008 NICOTINAMIDE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE; NNMT
DESCRIPTION Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.1) catalyzes the
N-methylation of nicotinamide and other pyridines. Human liver NNMT
activity has a bimodal frequency distribution, an observation that
raises the possibility that this enzyme activity may be regulated by a
genetic polymorphism. Such a polymorphism could have functional
implications for individual differences in drug and xenobiotic toxicity.
As a first step toward testing that hypothesis, Aksoy et al. (1994)
isolated a cDNA for human liver NNMT that was 969 bp long, with a 792-bp
open reading frame that encoded a 264-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 29,600 Da. Aksoy et al. (1994) suggested
that the cDNA could be used to study the molecular basis of individual
differences in enzyme activity in humans.

Aksoy et al. (1995) was able to localize the NNMT gene to chromosome 11
by performing PCR with human/rodent hybrid cell DNA as template and with
both intron- and exon-based primers. They then isolated a cosmid clone
from a human chromosome 11-specific genomic library and used it to
define the structure of the NNMT gene. It is approximately 16.5-kb in
length and consists of 3 exons and 2 introns. Transcription initiation
for the NNMT gene occurred 105 to 109 bp 5-prime upstream from the cDNA
translation initiation codon, as determined by both primer extension and
5-prime rapid amplification of cDNA ends. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, they mapped NNMT to 11q23.1.

Homocysteine (Hcy) plasma level is an independent risk marker for venous
thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure,
osteoporotic fractures, and Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300). Hcy levels
are determined by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.
The 677C-T polymorphism in the gene encoding
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; 607093.0003) has
consistently been associated with plasma Hcy levels. Souto et al. (2005)
conducted a genomewide linkage scan for genes affecting variation in
plasma Hcy levels in 398 patients from 21 extended Spanish families. The
strongest linkage signal (lod score = 3.01; genomewide p = 0.035) was
found on 11q23 in the vicinity of the NNMT gene, which is involved in
the metabolism of homocysteine. Haplotype analyses of 10 SNPs within
this gene identified 1 haplotype associated with plasma Hcy levels (p =
0.0003). Souto et al. (2005) concluded that the NNMT gene may be a major
genetic determinant of plasma homocysteine levels in Spanish families
and that since this gene encodes an enzyme involved in homocysteine
synthesis, the finding would be consistent with known biochemical
pathways.

161650	TITLE *161650 NEBULIN; NEB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nebulin is a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal matrix that
coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres of
skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of
the total myofibrillar protein and its size varies from 600 to 800 kD in
a manner that is tissue-, species-, and developmental stage-specific
(Stedman et al., 1988). A variety of nebulin isoforms are thought to
contribute to the molecular diversity of Z discs (Pelin et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using polyclonal nebulin antisera to screen a cDNA expression library,
Stedman et al. (1988) isolated 2 separate human fetal muscle cDNA
clones. Both cDNAs detected a 25-kb skeletal muscle RNA transcript.

Zeviani et al. (1988) also isolated 2 nonoverlapping cDNAs encoding
human nebulin.

Wang et al. (1996) isolated 2 partial cDNA sequences of fetal skeletal
muscle nebulin, and Labeit and Kolmerer (1995) obtained the nearly
identical sequence of a complete 20.8-kb cDNA encoding adult nebulin
(the few changes may be due to sequencing errors or polymorphisms). The
6,669-residue (773 kD) predicted protein contains 185 copies of 35-amino
acid modules that can be classified into 7 types. Labeit and Kolmerer
(1995) suggested alternative splicing as the explanation for
developmental or tissue-specific size variants of nebulin. They
speculated that features at the C-terminal end of the protein, including
an SH3 domain (which is also found in yeast actin-binding protein), may
anchor nebulin to the Z disc of the sarcomere.

Donner et al. (2004) found that the NEB protein contains an N-terminal
glutamic acid-rich domain followed by a tropomodulin-binding region; a
central region containing simple repeats, super repeats of 7 simple
repeats, and a desmin-binding region; and a C-terminal titin- and
myopalladin-binding region, which anchors the protein in the Z disc.
They also determined that the NEB gene encodes numerous splice variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Donner et al. (2004) determined that the nebulin gene contains 183 exons
in a 249-kb genomic region. The translation initiation codon is in exon
3, and the stop codon and the 3-prime untranslated region are in exon
183. The central region of the gene harbors an approximately 8.2-kb
region spanning 8 exons, which is duplicated twice (exons 82 to 89,
exons 90 to 97, and exons 98 to 105). The duplicated segments are 99%
identical. Introns 89, 97, and 105 contain LINE-2 repetitive elements.
There are 4 regions with alternatively spliced exons: exons 63 to 66, 82
to 105, 143 and 144, and 166 to 177.

MAPPING

Stedman et al. (1988) localized 2 human nebulin cDNAs from fetal muscle
to chromosome 2. By hybridization to DNA isolated from rodent-human cell
hybrids, Zeviani et al. (1988) assigned the human nebulin gene to
chromosome 2 and, by in situ hybridization, sublocalized it to region
2q31-q32.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Limongi et al. (1997)
demonstrated that the NEB gene is located on 2q24.2, whereas the gene
encoding the alpha-1 chain of type III collagen (120180) is located on
2q32.2. The FRA2 gene common fragile site lies between the 2 genes in
the 2q31 band.

Pelin et al. (1997) used radiation hybrid mapping to reassign the
nebulin gene close to the microsatellite marker D2S2236 on 2q22. They
concluded that the nebulin gene resides within the candidate region for
NEM2 (256030), a form of autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy.

Using 5 different series of recombinant inbred strains, Schurr et al.
(1991) mapped the mouse nebulin gene to proximal chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

In many tissues, actin monomers polymerize into actin (thin) filaments
of precise lengths. Using RNA interference, McElhinny et al. (2005)
demonstrated that nebulin behaves as a 'molecular ruler' in rat cardiac
and skeletal muscle. Upon nebulin knockdown, preexisting thin filaments
in cultured rat cardiac muscle cells were dramatically elongated from
their pointed ends; the barbed ends were unaffected. When the thin
filaments were depolymerized, myocytes with decreased nebulin levels
reassembled them to unrestricted lengths. Finally, knockdown of nebulin
in rat skeletal myotubes revealed its involvement in myofibrillogenesis.
McElhinny et al. (2005) concluded that nebulin has a role in specifying
and maintaining the length of actin thin filaments in striated muscle.

In mice, Takano et al. (2010) found that Igf1 (147440)-induced
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling formed a complex of nebulin
and N-Wasp (605056) at the Z bands of myofibrils by interfering with
glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK3B; 605004). Although N-Wasp is
known to be an activator of the Arp2/3 complex (see 604221) to form
branched actin filaments, the nebulin-N-Wasp complex caused actin
nucleation for unbranched actin filament formation from the Z bands
without the Arp2/3 complex. Furthermore, N-Wasp was required for
Igf1-induced muscle hypertrophy. Takano et al. (2010) concluded that
their findings presented the mechanisms of IGF1-induced actin filament
formation in myofibrillogenesis required for muscle maturation and
hypertrophy and a mechanism of actin nucleation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 5 unrelated families of different ethnic origins
with congenital autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy (NEB2; 256030),
Pelin et al. (1999) identified 6 different mutations in the NEB gene
(161650.0001-161650.0006). All of the mutations were located within the
M162-M185 segment. In 2 families with consanguineous parents, the
patients were homozygous for point mutations. In 1 family with
nonconsanguineous parents, the affected sibs were compound heterozygotes
for 2 different mutations, and in 2 further families with 1 detected
mutation each, haplotypes were compatible with compound heterozygosity.
Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies specific to the C-terminal
region of nebulin indicated that the mutations may cause protein
truncation possibly associated with loss of fiber-type diversity, which
may be relevant to disease pathogenesis.

Wallgren-Pettersson et al. (2002) identified mutations in the NEB gene
in patients with severe congenital nemaline myopathy (see, e.g.,
161650.0003 and 161650.0004).

In 5 affected individuals from 5 Ashkenazi Jewish families with
autosomal recessive typical nemaline myopathy (256030), Anderson et al.
(2004) identified a 2,502-bp deletion in the NEB gene (161650.0007).
Screening for this mutation in a random sample of 4,090 Ashkenazi Jewish
individuals revealed a carrier frequency of 1 in 108.

Donner et al. (2004) found that alternatively spliced exons 143 and 144
of the NEB gene give rise to 2 different transcripts that vary between
muscle types and between muscles of different developmental stages.
Alternatively spliced exons 166 to 177 express at least 20 different
transcripts in adult human tibialis anterior muscle alone. Donner et al.
(2004) suggested that the extensive alternative splicing of NEB may
explain why nemaline myopathy patients with homozygous truncating
mutations show expression of the C terminus of the protein. The use of
alternative transcripts may also explain why severe phenotypes are rare
among patients with 2 truncating mutations.

Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC),
Lehtokari et al. (2006) identified 45 novel mutations in the NEB gene in
affected members of 44 unrelated families with nemaline myopathy.
Mutations were identified in patients representing all clinical
categories of disease severity. The majority (55%) of mutations were
frameshift or nonsense mutations resulting in premature termination of
the protein. Mutations were distributed throughout the gene, with no
obvious hotspots. Lehtokari et al. (2006) concluded that mutations in
the NEB gene are the most common cause of nemaline myopathy.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEMALINE MYOPATHY 2
NEB, 1-BP DEL, G, EX165

In 2 affected sibs from a British family with nemaline myopathy-2
(256030), Pelin et al. (1999) identified a heterozygous 1-bp (G)
deletion in exon 165 of the NEB gene, predicted to cause a truncation of
the protein at the repeat domain M166. Based on the haplotypes in this
family, the authors suspected that the children's maternal allele
harbored an as yet unknown NEB mutation. The unaffected father also
carried the mutation.

.0002
NEMALINE MYOPATHY 2
NEB, 4-BP INS, EX172

In a Finnish child with NEM2 (256030), Pelin et al. (1999) identified a
4-bp (GTTT) duplication/insertion in exon 172 of the NEB gene encoding
part of the repeat domains M172 and M173. The child had inherited the
mutation from her unaffected mother. The duplication was predicted to
cause a frameshift leading to a stop codon in the beginning of exon 173,
and truncation of the protein from domain M173. Haplotype analysis
suggested that the child had inherited a different, unidentified,
mutation from her unaffected father.

.0003
NEMALINE MYOPATHY 2
NEB, 2-BP DEL, AG, EX172

In a French family, Pelin et al. (1999) found that 2 children with
nemaline myopathy (256030) were compound heterozygotes for 2 different
mutations in the NEB gene. From their unaffected father they inherited a
2-bp (AG) deletion in exon 172, and from their unaffected mother they
inherited a 2-bp (GA) deletion in exon 181 (161650.0004). The first
mutation would lead to a stop codon in the beginning of exon 173 and a
truncation of the protein from domain M173. The second mutation would
lead to a stop codon in exon 181 and truncation of the protein from
domain M182. Exon 181 is within the alternatively spliced region of NEB,
and the maternal mutation may therefore affect only some of the nebulin
isoforms. Wallgren-Pettersson et al. (2002) stated that, on
reexamination, these children had the severe form of the disorder.

.0005
NEMALINE MYOPATHY 2
NEB, GLU6636TER

Pelin et al. (1999) found that a British child with autosomal recessive
nemaline myopathy (256030), whose parents were consanguineous, had a
homozygous G-to-T transversion in exon 185 of the NEB gene, resulting in
a glu6636-to-ter (E6636X) substitution. The mutation was predicted to
result in the loss of the last 134 amino acids of the protein, from the
beginning of the serine-rich domain of the C-terminal region of nebulin.

.0006
NEMALINE MYOPATHY 2
NEB, IVS163DS, G-C

In the only affected child with NEM2 (256030) of a consanguineous German
family of Turkish descent, Pelin et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a
G-to-C transversion in the last codon of exon 163 of the NEB gene. The
mutation interfered with the 5-prime consensus splice site of intron 163
and was predicted to cause an in-frame skipping of exon 163 or partial
retention of intron 163, because of activation of a cryptic splice site
100-bp downstream in intron 163. The latter mRNA had a stop codon 36-bp
downstream of exon 163. The abnormally spliced mRNA was seen as 2
distinct RT-PCR products different from the control mRNA.

.0007
NEMALINE MYOPATHY 2
NEB, 2,502-BP DEL, EX55 DEL

In 5 affected individuals from 5 Ashkenazi Jewish families with
autosomal recessive typical nemaline myopathy (256030), Anderson et al.
(2004) identified a 2,502-bp deletion completely encompassing exon 55
and parts of introns 54 and 55 of the NEB gene, predicted to result in a
transcript encoding 35 fewer amino acids. Screening for this mutation in
a random sample of 4,090 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals revealed a carrier
frequency of 1 in 108.

Lehtokari et al. (2009) identified the 2,502-bp deletion in 14 of 355
probands with nemaline myopathy from around the world; 2 of the probands
had been reported by Anderson et al. (2004). Seven probands were
homozygous for the deletion, and 7 carried the mutation in
heterozygosity. Two of the families were not of known Ashkenazi Jewish
descent, but carried the common haplotype identified in Ashkenazi Jews.
The findings were consistent with a founder effect.

Ottenheijm et al. (2009) studied the muscular phenotype of nemaline
myopathy patients with NEB exon 55 deletion (NM-NEB). SDS-PAGE and
Western blot analysis revealed greatly reduced nebulin levels in
skeletal muscle of NM-NEB patients, with the most prominent reduction at
nebulin's N-terminal end. Muscle mechanical studies indicated an
approximately 60% reduced force generating capacity of NM-NEB muscle and
a leftward shift of the force-sarcomere length relation in NM-NEB muscle
fibers. This indicates that the mechanism for the force reduction is
likely to include shorter and nonuniform thin filament lengths in NM-NEB
muscle compared with control muscle. The average thin filament length
was reduced from approximately 1.3-micrometer in control muscle to
approximately 0.75-micrometer in NM-NEB muscle. Ottenheijm et al. (2009)
hypothesized that dysregulated thin filament length may contribute to
muscle weakness in nemaline myopathy patients with nebulin mutations.

612700	TITLE *612700 RIMS-BINDING PROTEIN 3B; RIMBP3B
;;RIMBP3.2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) cloned mouse Rimbp3, and by database
analysis, they identified 3 human RIMBP3 genes, RIMBP3 (612699),
RIMBP3B, and RIMBP3C (612701), which share 99% nucleotide identity. Each
of the deduced human RIMBP3 proteins contains 1,639 amino acids and has
a calculated molecular mass of 180 kD. The protein has a central SRC
(190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain, followed by 2 tandem fibronectin
(135600)-like 3 (FN3) domains, and 2 C-terminal SH3 domains.
Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) noted that all other members of the RIMBP
family have 3 tandem FN3 domains. The N-terminal region is rich in
arginine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, and proline.
Quantitative real-time PCR of mouse tissues detected ubiquitous Rimbp3
expression, with the highest level in testis. Rimbp3 showed low uniform
expression in all mouse brain regions examined and in embryonic mouse
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) found that each of the 3 RIMBP3 genes
contains a single exon. RIMBP3B spans about 5.5 kb.

MAPPING

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) mapped the 3 RIMBP3 genes to a 1.4-Mb
region of chromosome 22q11.21. They mapped the single mouse Rimbp3 gene
to chromosome 16A3.

191170	TITLE *191170 TUMOR PROTEIN p53; TP53
;;P53;;
TRANSFORMATION-RELATED PROTEIN 53; TRP53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The transcription factor p53 responds to diverse cellular stresses to
regulate target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. In addition, p53
appears to induce apoptosis through nontranscriptional cytoplasmic
processes. In unstressed cells, p53 is kept inactive essentially through
the actions of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (164785), which inhibits p53
transcriptional activity and ubiquitinates p53 to promote its
degradation. Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53
activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less
abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity. Activity of p53 is
ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by mutation of the p53 gene
itself or by loss of cell signaling upstream or downstream of p53
(Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Bourdon, 2007; Vousden and Lane, 2007).

CLONING

Vogelstein and Kinzler (1994) stated that the central region (amino
acids 100 to 300, approximately) of the 393-amino acid p53 protein
contains the DNA-binding domain. This proteolysis-resistant core is
flanked by a C-terminal end mediating oligomerization and an N-terminal
end containing a strong transcription activation signal.

Yin et al. (2002) found that MDM2 (164785) induced translation of p53
mRNA from 2 alternative initiation sites. Translation from the second
site resulted in an N-terminally truncated protein with an apparent
molecular mass of 47 kD that the authors designated p53/47. The p53/47
isoform lacks the MDM2-binding site and the most N-terminal
transcriptional activation domain of full-length p53.

Bourdon et al. (2005) showed that the p53 gene has a complex
transcriptional expression pattern encoding different p53 mRNA variants
through the use of alternative splicing and an internal promoter in
intron 4. The C terminus can be alternatively spliced to produce 3
isoforms, p53, p53-beta, and p53-gamma, where the last 2 isoforms lack
the oligomerization domain. The alternative promoter leads to expression
of an N-terminally truncated protein (del133p53) initiated at codon 133.
RT-PCR detected the full-length p53 transcript in all normal human
tissues examined, and 5 variants were expressed in a tissue-specific
manner. All variants tested were translated in transfected cells, and
the proteins had apparent molecular masses of 28 to 53 kD. Western blot
analysis detected endogenous p53 isoforms of 28 and 45 kD in an
osteosarcoma cell line. The 6 isoforms also showed distinct subcellular
localizations following transfection.

Using RT-PCR, Nikoshkov and Hurd (2006) identified 8 novel p53
transcripts in human brain regions. Almost all alternative splice events
occurred due to atypical splicing of direct repeats at splice sites. The
pattern of p53 splicing was specific for brain areas and for
individuals. In contrast to brain, human kidney and heart expressed only
full-length p53.

Reisman et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA representing an mRNA apparently
initiated from a second promoter located in intron 1 of the p53 gene.
They designated the gene encoding the transcript HP53INT1. The cDNA was
polyadenylated downstream from a consensus poly(A) addition site and was
derived entirely from intron 1 of the p53 gene. Reisman et al. (1996)
concluded that HP53INT1 may be a pseudogene. Alternatively, they
suggested that it may have a function, since transcripts were present in
human cells and their levels were induced during terminal
differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Reisman et al. (1988) identified 2 promoters in the p53 gene. The first
is located 100 to 250 bp upstream of the noncoding first exon, and the
second, a stronger promoter, is located within the first intron.

Bourdon et al. (2005) stated that the TP53 gene contains 11 exons. It
has 2 transcriptional start sites in exon 1, and alternative splicing
occurs in intron 2 and between exons 9 and 10. The gene also contains an
internal promoter and transcription initiation site in intron 4.

MAPPING

By analyzing man-rodent hybrid cells, McBride et al. (1985, 1986) mapped
the P53 gene to chromosome 17. They regionalized the gene to chromosome
17p13 using hybrids with a chromosome 17 translocation and in situ
hybridization. By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Benchimol et al. (1985)
also assigned the P53 gene to the short arm of chromosome 17. Isobe et
al. (1986) assigned the TP53 gene to chromosome 17p13.

By in situ hybridization with a mouse DNA probe, Le Beau et al. (1985)
mapped the human P53 gene to chromosome 17q21-q22. Subsequently, this
group concluded that the TP53 gene is on the short arm (Rowley, 1986).

By Southern filter hybridization of DNAs from human-rodent hybrids,
Miller et al. (1986) localized the P53 gene to chromosome 17p. They
suggested that the use of the mouse gene as the probe in the work of Le
Beau et al. (1985) may have been responsible for their inaccurate
results, since the murine and human genes are not completely homologous.

Somatic cell hybrid studies by vanTuinen and Ledbetter (1987) narrowed
the assignment of the TP53 gene to chromosome 17p13.105-p12.

GENE FUNCTION

- Reviews

Levine et al. (1991) reviewed p53 function and how alteration or
inactivation of p53 by mutation or by interaction with oncogene products
of DNA tumor viruses can lead to cancer.

Vogelstein and Kinzler (1992) reviewed function and dysfunction of the
p53 gene and outlined 5 mechanisms for p53 inactivation, including
disruption of its negative regulator, MDM2 (164785).

Science magazine designated p53 the 'Molecule of the Year' for 1993.
Culotta and Koshland (1993) and Harris (1993) gave an extensive account
of its discovery and elucidation of function, as well as the use of p53
in cancer risk assessment.

Harris and Hollstein (1993) reviewed molecular mechanisms of p53
function and highlighted the clinical implications of changes in the p53
gene in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of human
cancer.

Levine (1997) reviewed all aspects of p53, which he referred to as the
cellular gatekeeper for growth and division.

Artandi and Attardi (2005) reviewed the role of p53 in enforcing
senescence and apoptotic responses to dysfunctional telomeres. They
stated that loss of p53 creates a permissive environment in which
critically short telomeres are inappropriately joined to generate
chromosomal end-to-end fusions. These fused chromosomes result in cycles
of chromosome fusion bridge breakage, which can lead to cancers,
especially in epithelial tissues, by facilitating changes in gene copy
number.

Toledo and Wahl (2006) reviewed in vitro studies, human tumor data, and
mouse models to deduce p53 regulatory mechanisms. They concluded that
p53 posttranslational modifications have modulatory roles, whereas MDM2
and MDM4 (602704) have more profound roles in p53 regulation.

Bourdon (2007) reviewed p53 isoforms and their roles in p53 regulation
and cancer.

Vousden and Lane (2007) reviewed ways in which p53 can contribute to the
development, life expectancy, and overall fitness of an organism outside
of its role in protecting against cancer development.

Green and Kroemer (2009) reviewed the cytoplasmic functions of p53.

- Role of p53 in Transcriptional Regulation

Fields and Jang (1990), Unger et al. (1992), and Chumakov et al. (1993)
discussed the DNA-binding properties of wildtype and mutant p53 and
their roles in transcriptional transactivation.

By sequencing 18 human genomic clones that bound p53 in vitro, El-Deiry
et al. (1992) identified a consensus binding site with striking internal
symmetry, consisting of 2 copies of a 10-bp motif separated by 0 to 13
bp. One copy of the motif was insufficient for p53 binding, and subtle
alterations of the motif, even when present in multiple copies, resulted
in loss of affinity for p53. Mutants of p53 representing each of the 4
'hotspots' that are altered frequently in human cancers failed to bind
the consensus dimer.

Vogelstein and Kinzler (1992) proposed a model in which p53 binds as a
tetramer to a p53-binding site (PBS) and activates expression of
downstream genes that inhibit growth and/or invasion. Pavletich et al.
(1993) stated that tetramerization occurs by interactions between the
p53 monomers through a C-terminal domain comprising amino acid residues
325 to 356.

Foster et al. (1999) identified multiple classes of small molecules (300
to 500 daltons) that promoted conformational stability of the wildtype
p53 DNA-binding domain and of full-length p53. These compounds also
allowed mutant p53 to maintain an active conformation. A prototype
compound caused accumulation of conformationally active p53 in cells
with mutant p53, enabling it to activate transcription and to slow tumor
growth in mice.

Yu et al. (2000) showed that loss of the ERCC6 protein (609413) or
overexpression of the C-terminal domain of p53 in human cells induced
fragility of the RNU1 (180680), RNU2 (180690), and RN5S (180420) genes
and the ancient PSU1 locus, which consists entirely of pseudogenes.
Moreover, they found that p53 interacted with ERCC6 in vivo and in
vitro. The authors proposed that ERCC6 functions as an elongation factor
for transcription of structured RNAs, including some mRNAs. Activation
of p53 inhibits ERCC6, stalling transcription complexes and locally
blocking chromatin condensation.

To determine whether TP53 gene dosage affects transcriptional regulation
of target genes, Yoon et al. (2002) performed oligonucleotide array gene
expression analysis by using human cells with wildtype p53 or with 1 or
both TP53 alleles disrupted by homologous recombination. They identified
35 genes whose expression was significantly correlated with TP53 dosage,
including genes involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion,
transcription regulation, neurogenesis, and neural crest migration.
Motif search analysis revealed that of the genes highly expressed in
wildtype and heterozygous p53 cells, several had a putative p53
consensus binding site, suggesting that they may be directly regulated
by p53. From these genes, Yoon et al. (2002) chose CSPG2 (118661) for
further study, and in vitro and in vivo assays showed that CSPG2 was
directly transactivated by p53.

Using systems reconstituted with recombinant chromatin templates and
coactivators, An et al. (2004) showed that p300 (EP300; 602700), PRMT1
(602950), and CARM1 (603934) acted both independently and cooperatively
in mediating gene activation by p53. Overexpression of p53 or
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-induced DNA damage in human cell lines led
to targeted recruitment of these and other coactivators, as well as
accumulation of histone acetylation and methylation marks, on the p53
target gene GADD45 (126335).

Bourdon et al. (2005) showed that human p53 and the p53-beta isoform
bound differentially to p53-responsive promoters and differentially
activated p53-responsive reporter genes. The del133p53 isoform impaired
p53-mediated apoptosis. Bourdon et al. (2005) concluded that the
functions of p53 are mediated by the interplay between p53 isoforms and
full-length p53.

- Role of p53 in MicroRNA Processing

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key posttranscriptional regulators of gene
expression that are involved in diverse physiologic and pathologic
processes. Suzuki et al. (2009) found that p53 enhanced
posttranscriptional maturation of several miRNAs with growth-suppressive
functions, including miR16-1 (609704), miR143 (612117), miR145 (611795),
and miR206 (611599), in response to DNA damage. In HCT116 human colon
cancer cells and human diploid fibroblasts, p53 interacted with the
Drosha (RNASEN; 608828) miRNA-processing complex through association
with the DEAD-box RNA helicase p68 (DDX5; 180630) and facilitated
processing of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) to precursor miRNAs
(pre-miRNAs). Suzuki et al. (2009) introduced several tumor-derived,
transcriptionally inactive p53 mutants, including arg175 to his (R175H;
191170.0030) and arg273 to his (R273H; 191170.0020), into p53-null
HCT116 cells and found that they suppressed the pre-miRNA and mature
miRNA levels of miR16-1, miR143, and miR206 compared with the constant
level of pri-miRNAs. In contrast, wildtype p53 increased the pre-miRNA
and mature miRNA expression levels of these miRNAs. The p53 mutants also
decreased production of mature and precursor miR16-1 and miR143 from
ectopically expressed pri-miR16-1/pri-miR143, suggesting that the p53
mutants hindered miRNA processing in a transcription-independent manner.
Further experiments suggested that the p53 mutants interfered with
functional assembly between Drosha complex and p68, leading to
attenuation of miRNA-processing activity. Suzuki et al. (2009) concluded
that transcription-independent modulation of miRNA biogenesis is
intrinsically embedded in a tumor-suppressive program governed by p53.

- Role of p53 in Cell Cycle Control

Using transgenic mice, Lee and Bernstein (1993) found that expression of
either of 2 mutant p53 alleles significantly increased cellular
resistance of a variety of hematopoietic cell lineages to gamma
radiation. They speculated that wildtype p53 may serve as a 'guardian of
the genome,' preventing proliferation of a cell that has sustained
genetic damage. Thus, cells lacking wildtype p53 protein due to a
dominant-negative action of mutant p53 might not undergo
radiation-induced cell death, thereby increasing radiation resistance.

El-Deiry et al. (1993) found that induction of WAF1 (CDKN1A; 116899) was
associated with wildtype but not mutant p53 gene expression in a human
brain tumor cell line. WAF1 is also called CIP1 or p21, and Harper et
al. (1993) showed that it binds to cyclin complexes and inhibits the
function of cyclin-dependent kinases. El-Deiry et al. (1993) suggested
that p53 is not required for normal development, but its expression is
stimulated in certain cellular environments, such as DNA damage or
cellular stress. In turn, p53 binds to WAF1 regulatory elements and
transcriptionally activates its expression. WAF1 subsequently binds to
and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase activity, preventing
phosphorylation of critical cyclin-dependent kinase substrates and
blocking cell cycle progression. In tumor cells with inactive p53, this
pathway would thereby be defective, permitting unregulated growth.

After DNA damage, many cells appear to enter a sustained arrest in the
G2 phase of the cell cycle. Bunz et al. (1998) demonstrated that this
arrest could be sustained only when p53 was present in the cell and
capable of transcriptionally activating p21. After disruption of either
p53 or p21, gamma-radiated cells progressed into mitosis and exhibited
G2 DNA content only due to failure of cytokinesis. Bunz et al. (1998)
concluded that p53 and p21 are essential for maintaining the G2
checkpoint in human cells.

The centrosome plays a vital role in mitotic fidelity, ensuring
establishment of bipolar spindles and balanced chromosome segregation.
Centrosome duplication occurs only once during the cell cycle and is
therefore highly regulated. Fukasawa et al. (1996) showed that in mouse
embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53, multiple copies of functionally
competent centrosomes were generated during a single cell cycle. In
contrast, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from normal mice or mice deficient
in the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (RB1; 614041) did
not display these abnormalities. The abnormally amplified centrosomes
profoundly affected mitotic fidelity, resulting in unequal segregation
of chromosomes. These observations implicated p53 in the regulation of
centrosome duplication and suggested a possible mechanism by which loss
of p53 may cause genetic instability.

Raj et al. (2001) reported that adeno-associated virus (AAV) selectively
induced apoptosis in human cells lacking active p53. Cells with intact
p53 activity were not killed, but underwent arrest in the G2 phase of
the cell cycle. This arrest was characterized by increased p53 activity
and p21 levels and by targeted destruction of CDC25C (157680). Neither
cell killing nor arrest depended upon AAV-encoded proteins. Rather, AAV
DNA, which is single stranded with hairpin structures at both ends,
elicited in cells a DNA damage response that, in the absence of p53, led
to cell death. AAV also inhibited tumor growth in mice. Raj et al.
(2001) concluded that viruses can be used to deliver DNA of unusual
structure into cells to trigger a DNA damage response without damaging
cellular DNA and to selectively eliminate cells lacking p53 activity.

Aylon et al. (2006) found that LATS2 (604861) had a role in the
p53-dependent G1/S arrest following damage to the mitotic spindle and
centrosome dysfunction. LATS2 interacted physically with MDM2 (164785)
to inhibit p53 ubiquitination and to promote p53 activation.

Xue et al. (2007) used RNA interference to conditionally regulate
endogenous p53 expression in a mosaic mouse model of liver carcinoma.
Brief reactivation of endogenous p53 in p53-deficient tumors could
produce complete tumor regressions. The primary response to p53 was not
apoptosis, but instead involved induction of a cellular senescence
program associated with differentiation and upregulation of inflammatory
cytokines. This program, although producing only cell cycle arrest in
vitro, also triggered an innate immune response that targeted tumor
cells in vivo, thereby contributing to tumor clearance. Xue et al.
(2007) concluded that p53 loss may be required for maintenance of
aggressive carcinomas and that the cellular senescence program can act
together with the innate immune system to potently limit tumor growth.

Using semiquantitative RT-PCR of wildtype and p53-null mouse embryonic
fibroblasts, He et al. (2007) found that expression of miR34a (611172),
miR34b (611374), and miR34c (611375) correlated precisely with p53
status. These miR34 genes were direct transcriptional targets of p53 in
human and mouse cells, and their induction by DNA damage and oncogenic
stress depended on p53 in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of miR34
induced cell cycle arrest in both primary and tumor-derived cell lines,
consistent with the ability of miR34 to downregulate a program of genes
promoting cell cycle progression.

Qian et al. (2008) identified DEC1 (BHLHB2; 604256) as a p53 family
target gene that mediates p53-induced cellular senescence in response to
DNA damage.

Lee et al. (2012) found that starved mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking
the essential autophagy gene product Atg7 (608760) failed to undergo
cell cycle arrest. Independent of its E1-like enzymatic activity, Atg7
could bind to the tumor suppressor p53 to regulate the transcription of
the gene encoding the cell cycle inhibitor p21(CDKN1A) (116899). With
prolonged metabolic stress, the absence of Atg7 resulted in augmented
DNA damage with increased p53-dependent apoptosis. Inhibition of the DNA
damage response by deletion of the protein kinase Chk2 (604373)
partially rescued postnatal lethality in Atg7 -/- mice. Thus, Lee et al.
(2012) concluded that when nutrients are limited, Atg7 regulates
p53-dependent cell cycle and cell death pathways.

Using a computational model, Purvis et al. (2012) identified a sequence
of precisely timed drug additions that altered p53 pulses to instead
produce a sustained p53 response. This led to the expression of a
different set of downstream genes and also altered cell fate: cells that
experienced p53 pulses recovered from DNA damage, whereas cells exposed
to sustained p53 signaling frequently underwent senescence. Purvis et
al. (2012) concluded that protein dynamics can be an important part of a
signal, directly influencing cellular fate decisions.

Jiang et al. (2013) showed that p53 represses the expression of the
tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated malic enzymes ME1 (154250) and ME2
(154270) in human and mouse cells. Both malic enzymes are important for
NADPH production, lipogenesis, and glutamine metabolism, but ME2 has a
more profound effect. Through the inhibition of malic enzymes, p53
regulates cell metabolism and proliferation. Downregulation of ME1 and
ME2 reciprocally activates p53 through distinct MDM2- (164785) and
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK; see 602739)-mediated mechanisms in a
feed-forward manner, bolstering this pathway and enhancing p53
activation. Downregulation of ME1 and ME2 also modulates the outcome of
p53 activation, leading to strong induction of senescence, but not
apoptosis, whereas enforced expression of either malic enzyme suppresses
senescence. Jiang et al. (2013) concluded that their findings defined
physiologic functions of malic enzymes, demonstrated a positive-feedback
mechanism that sustains p53 activation, and revealed a connection
between metabolism and senescence mediated by p53.

- Role of p53 in Apoptosis

Caelles et al. (1994) developed immortalized somatotropic progenitor
cells expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant. In these cells,
induction of apoptosis by DNA damage depended strictly on p53 function.
Temperature-shift experiments showed that the extent of apoptotic DNA
cleavage was directly proportional to the period during which p53 was
functional. A shift to the permissive temperature triggered apoptosis
following UV radiation-induced DNA damage independently of new RNA or
protein synthesis. Caelles et al. (1994) suggested that, rather than
activating apoptosis-mediator genes, p53 either represses genes
necessary for cell survival or is a component of the enzymatic machinery
for apoptotic cleavage or repair of DNA.

Polyak et al. (1997) used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to
examine transcripts induced by p53 before the onset of apoptosis. Of
7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 (0.19%) were markedly increased in
p53-expressing cells compared with controls. Many of these genes were
predicted to encode proteins that could generate or respond to oxidative
stress. Additional biochemical and pharmacologic experiments suggested
that p53 triggers apoptosis through transcriptional induction of
redox-related genes, followed by formation of reactive oxygen species
and oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components.

Sablina et al. (2005) found that p53 had an antioxidant function
associated with highly responsive p53 target genes induced during
nonlethal oxidative stress in several human cell lines. Prooxidant
effects of p53 in gravely damaged cells were associated with delayed
induction of proapoptotic genes. The p53-dependent increase in reactive
oxygen species was secondary to induction of apoptosis and originated
from mitochondrial leakage.

Conseiller et al. (1998) constructed a 'chimeric tumor suppressor-1'
(CTS1) gene from wildtype p53 by removing the domains that mediate p53
inactivation. CTS1 enhanced transcriptional activity, was resistant to
inactivation by MDM2 (164785), had the ability to suppress cell growth,
and showed faster induction of apoptosis. Conseiller et al. (1998)
considered CTS1 to be an alternative for use in gene therapy for
wildtype p53-resistant tumors.

Ryan et al. (2000) examined the effect of p53 induction on activation of
NF-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), a transcription factor that can protect
from or contribute to apoptosis. In human cells without NFKB activity,
p53-induced apoptosis was abrogated. Ryan et al. (2000) found that p53
activated NFKB through the RAF (164760)/MEK1 (176872)/p90(rsk) (see
601684) pathway rather than the TNFR1 (191190)/TRAF2 (601895)/IKK (e.g.,
600664) pathway used by TNFA (191160). Inhibition of MEK1 blocked
p53-induced NFKB activation and apoptosis, but not cell cycle arrest.

Ollmann et al. (2000) identified a Drosophila homolog of p53, which they
called Dmp53. Like mammalian p53, Dmp53 bound specifically to human
p53-binding sites, and overexpression of Dmp53 induced apoptosis.
Inhibition of Dmp53 function rendered cells resistant to x-ray-induced
apoptosis, suggesting that Dmp53 is required for the apoptotic response
to DNA damage. Unlike mammalian p53, Dmp53 appeared unable to induce a
G1 cell cycle block when overexpressed, and inhibition of Dmp53 activity
did not affect x-ray-induced cell cycle arrest. These data revealed an
ancestral proapoptotic function for p53 and identified Drosophila as an
ideal model system for elucidating the p53 apoptotic pathway(s) induced
by DNA damage.

Brodsky et al. (2000) also identified a Drosophila p53 homolog and
demonstrated that it could activate transcription from a promoter
containing binding sites for human p53. Dominant-negative forms of Dmp53
inhibited transactivation in cultured cells and radiation-induced
apoptosis in developing tissues. The cis-regulatory region of the
proapoptotic gene 'reaper' contains a radiation-inducible enhancer that
includes a consensus p53-binding site. Dmp53 could activate
transcription from this site in yeast, and a multimer of this site was
sufficient for radiation induction in vivo. These results indicated that
reaper is a direct transcriptional target of Dmp53 following DNA damage.

Robles et al. (2001) identified a classic p53-responsive element
upstream of the APAF1 (602233) transcription start site that bound p53
and induced APAF1 gene expression. Apoptosis in a lymphoblastoid cell
line, caused by DNA damage due to exposure to ionizing radiation or to
doxorubicin, induced APAF1 mRNA and protein expression and was strictly
dependent on wildtype p53 function. Robles et al. (2001) concluded that
APAF1 is an essential downstream effector of p53-mediated apoptosis.

Fortin et al. (2001) identified 2 p53 consensus binding sites in the
mouse Apaf1 promoter and showed that both sites were used by p53.
Primary cultures of Apaf1-deficient neurons were significantly protected
from p53-induced apoptosis.

Castedo et al. (2001) delineated the apoptotic pathway resulting from
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-induced
syncytia formation in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated the presence of phosphorylated ser15 of p53 as well as the
preapoptotic marker tissue transglutaminase (TGM2; 190196) in syncytium
in the apical light zone (T-cell area) of lymph nodes, as well as in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, from HIV-1-positive but not
HIV-1-negative donors. The presence of these markers correlated with
viral load (HIV-1 RNA levels). Quantitative immunoblot analysis showed
that phosphorylation of ser15 of p53 in response to HIV-1 Env was
mediated by FRAP (601231) and was accompanied by downregulation of
protein phosphatase-2A (see 176915). The phosphorylation was
significantly inhibited by rapamycin. Immunofluorescence microscopy
indicated that FRAP was enriched in syncytial nuclei and that the
nuclear accumulation preceded phosphorylation of ser15 of p53. Castedo
et al. (2001) concluded that HIV-1 Env-induced syncytium formation leads
to apoptosis via a pathway that involves phosphorylation of ser15 of p53
by FRAP, followed by activation of BAX (600040), mitochondrial membrane
permeabilization, release of cytochrome C, and caspase activation.

Derry et al. (2001) identified Cep1, a C. elegans homolog of mammalian
p53. Cep1 was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, promoted DNA
damage-induced apoptosis, and was required for normal meiotic chromosome
segregation in the germline. Although somatic apoptosis was unaffected,
Cep1 mutants showed hypersensitivity to hypoxia-induced lethality and
decreased longevity in response to starvation-induced stress.
Overexpression of Cep1 promoted widespread caspase-independent cell
death, demonstrating the critical importance of regulating p53 function
at appropriate levels.

Sax et al. (2002) presented evidence that BID (601997) belongs to a
subset of p53-upregulated targets whose induction and subsequent
processing mediates p53-induced apoptosis.

Brantley et al. (2002) examined expression of p53 and Rb (614041) in 12
eyes containing posterior uveal melanomas following plaque radiotherapy.
All cases showed tumor cell loss with residual tumor cells. Strong p53
staining was observed in 6 cases (50%) and was significantly associated
with recent radiotherapy. Abnormal cytoplasmic Rb staining was observed
in 4 cases (33%). Brantley et al. (2002) concluded that plaque
radiotherapy damaged DNA, inhibited cell division, and promoted cell
death, at least in part, due to induction of p53.

Seoane et al. (2002) identified MYC (190080) as a principal determinant
of whether DNA damage-induced activation of p53 results in cell cycle
arrest or apoptosis. MYC was directly recruited to the p21 (CDKN1A;
116899) promoter by the DNA-binding protein MIZ1 (604084). This
interaction blocked p21 induction by p53 and other activators. As a
result, MYC switched the p53-dependent response of colon cancer cells to
DNA damage from cytostatic to apoptotic. MYC did not modify the ability
of p53 to bind the p21 or PUMA (605854) promoters, but it selectively
inhibited bound p53 from activating p21 transcription. By inhibiting p21
expression, MYC favored initiation of apoptosis, thereby influencing the
outcome of a p53 response in favor of cell death.

Yin et al. (2003) showed that p53 activated transcription of PAC1
(603068) by binding to a palindromic site in the PAC1 promoter during
apoptosis. PAC1 transcription was induced in response to serum
deprivation and oxidative stress, which resulted in p53-dependent
apoptosis, but not in response to gamma irradiation, which caused cell
cycle arrest. Reduction of PAC1 transcription using small interfering
RNA inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis, whereas overexpression of PAC1
increased susceptibility to apoptosis and suppressed tumor formation.
Moreover, Yin et al. (2003) found that activation of p53 significantly
inhibited MAP kinase (see 602425) activity. They concluded that, under
specific stress conditions, p53 regulates transcription of PAC1 through
a novel p53-binding site, and that PAC1 is necessary and sufficient for
p53-mediated apoptosis.

Takaoka et al. (2003) found that IFNA (147660)/IFNB (147640) induced
transcription and translation of p53. IFNA/B signaling itself did not
activate p53, but it contributed to boosting p53 responses to stress
signals. Takaoka et al. (2003) provided examples in which p53 gene
induction by IFNA/B contributed to tumor suppression. Furthermore, they
showed that p53 was activated in virally infected cells to evoke an
apoptotic response and that p53 was critical for antiviral defense of
the host. IFNA/B transcriptionally induced p53 through ISGF3 (147574).
Whereas IFNA/B induced p53 mRNA and increased its protein level,
p53-mediated responses such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis were not
observed in cells treated with IFNA/B alone.

Mihara et al. (2003) provided evidence that p53 translocation to
mitochondria occurred in vivo in irradiated thymocytes. They showed that
p53 could directly induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial
membrane by forming complexes with the protective BCLXL (see 600039) and
BCL2 (151430) proteins, resulting in cytochrome c release. p53 bound
BCLXL via its DNA-binding domain. Tumor-derived
transactivation-deficient mutants of p53 concomitantly lost the ability
to interact with BCLXL and promote cytochrome c release. Mihara et al.
(2003) concluded that p53 mutations might represent 'double hits' by
abrogating the transcriptional and mitochondrial apoptotic activities of
p53.

Jin et al. (2003) found that CIAP1 (BIRC2; 601712), an inhibitor of
apoptosis, was involved in the p53-dependent response to apoptotic
stimuli. In both primary mouse thymocytes and HeLa cells, the
mitochondrial serine protease HTRA2 (606441) cleaved CIAP1. HTRA2
expression was induced by p53, and cleavage of CIAP1 by HTRA2 was
required to relieve caspase inhibition and activate apoptosis.

Chipuk et al. (2004) found that cytosolic localization of endogenous
wildtype or transactivation-deficient p53 was necessary and sufficient
for apoptosis. p53 directly activated the proapoptotic BCL2 protein BAX
in the absence of other proteins to permeabilize mitochondria and engage
the apoptotic program. p53 also released both proapoptotic multidomain
proteins and BH3-only proteins that were sequestered by BCLXL.
Transcription-independent activation of BAX by p53 occurred with similar
kinetics and concentrations to those produced by activated BID. Chipuk
et al. (2004) proposed that when p53 accumulates in the cytosol, it can
function analogously to the BH3-only subset of proapoptotic BCL2
proteins to activate BAX and trigger apoptosis.

Leu et al. (2004) found that after cell stress, p53 interacted with BAK
(600516), resulting in oligomerization of BAK and release of cytochrome
c from mitochondria. Formation of the p53-BAK complex coincided with
loss of interaction between BAK and the antiapoptotic protein MCL1
(159552). Leu et al. (2004) suggested that p53 and MCL1 have opposing
effects on mitochondrial apoptosis by modulating BAK activity.

Liver is generally refractory to apoptosis induced by p53. Leu and
George (2007) found that p53 activation led to enhanced expression of
IGFBP1 (146730) in human hepatoma cells. A portion of intracellular
IGFBP1 localized to mitochondria, where it bound the proapoptotic
protein BAK. Binding of IGFBP1 to BAK impaired formation of the
proapoptotic p53/BAK complex and induction of apoptosis in cultured
human and mouse cells and in mouse liver. In contrast, livers of
Igfbp1-deficient mice exhibited spontaneous apoptosis accompanied by p53
mitochondrial accumulation and evidence of Bak oligomerization. Leu and
George (2007) concluded that IGFBP1 is a negative regulator of the
p53/BAK-dependent pathway of apoptosis.

Schultz et al. (2004) showed that TIAF1 (609517) and p53 induced
apoptosis in human U937 myocytoma cells in both synergistic and
antagonistic manners. At optimal levels, both TIAF1 and p53 mediated
apoptosis cooperatively. Both proteins also suppressed
adherence-independent growth in a mouse fibroblast cell line. In
contrast, initiation of apoptosis by overexpressed TIAF1 was blocked by
low doses of p53, and vice versa. Ectopic p53 blocked apoptosis in U937
cells stably expressing TIAF1. TIAF1 and p53 did not appear to
physically interact; however, nuclear translocation of phosphorylated
p53 was significantly reduced in TIAF1-silenced cells. Schultz et al.
(2004) concluded that TIAF1 likely participates in the nuclear
translocation of activated p53.

Johnson et al. (2005) generated a Trp53 knockin mouse strain carrying
mutations of 2 residues crucial for transactivation: leu25 to gln (L25Q)
and trp26 to ser (W26S). The mutant protein was designated p53(QS).
These mutations had selective effects on the biologic functions of p53
in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Although its ability to activate various
p53 target genes was largely compromised, the p53(QS) protein retained
the ability to transactivate Bax. The ability of the p53(QS) protein to
elicit a DNA damage-induced G1 cell cycle arrest response was also
partially impaired. The p53(QS) protein had selective defects in its
ability to induce apoptosis: it was completely unable to activate
apoptosis in response to DNA damage and was partially unable to do so
when subjected to serum deprivation, but it retained substantial
apoptotic activity upon exposure to hypoxia. These findings suggested
that p53 acts through distinct, stimulus-specific pathways to induce
apoptosis.

Nuclear p53 regulates proapoptotic genes, whereas cytoplasmic p53
directly activates proapoptotic BCL2 proteins to permeabilize
mitochondria and initiate apoptosis. Chipuk et al. (2005) found that a
tripartite nexus between BCLXL, cytoplasmic p53, and PUMA coordinated
these distinct p53 functions in mouse and human cells. After genotoxic
stress, BCLXL sequestered cytoplasmic p53. Nuclear p53 caused expression
of PUMA, which then displaced p53 from BCLXL, allowing p53 to induce
mitochondrial permeabilization. Mutant BCLXL that bound p53, but not
PUMA, rendered cells resistant to p53-induced apoptosis irrespective of
PUMA expression. Thus, Chipuk et al. (2005) concluded that PUMA couples
the nuclear and cytoplasmic proapoptotic functions of p53.

Esteve et al. (2005) found that DNMT1 (126375) bound p53 and that the 2
proteins colocalized in nuclei of human colon carcinoma cell lines.
DNMT1 and p53 cooperated in methylation and repression of endogenous
survivin (BIRC5; 603352), an antiapoptotic gene containing p53-binding
sites in its promoter region.

Raver-Shapira et al. (2007) showed that p53 overexpression in a human
colon cancer cell line led to a 20-fold increase in MIR34A (611172),
paralleling induction of p21. Exposure to whole-body irradiation induced
both Mir34a and p21 mRNA in wildtype mice, but it only induced p21 mRNA
in p53-knockout mice. Inactivation of MIR34A attenuated p53-mediated
apoptosis in cells exposed to genotoxic stress, whereas overexpression
of MIR34A mildly increased apoptosis. Independently, Chang et al. (2007)
also identified MIR34A as a direct target of p53.

Godar et al. (2008) found that p53 negatively regulated CD44 (107269)
expression in normal human mammary epithelial cells by binding to a
noncanonical p53-binding sequence in the CD44 promoter. Inhibition of
CD44 enabled the cells to respond to stress-induced, p53-dependent
cytostatic and apoptotic signals that would have otherwise been blocked
by CD44. In the absence of p53, CD44 promoted growth in a highly
tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line.

Ide et al. (2009) showed that GAMT (601240) was upregulated in a
p53-dependent manner following DNA damage- and glucose
deprivation-induced stress in human and mouse cells. p53-dependent GAMT
upregulation was required to induce apoptosis and metabolic changes,
including fatty acid oxidation, in response to glucose deprivation.

Sendoel et al. (2010) showed that C. elegans HIF1, homologous to human
HIF-alpha, 603348, protects against DNA damage-induced germ cell
apoptosis by antagonizing the function of CEP1, the homolog of p53. The
antiapoptotic property of HIF1 is mediated by means of transcriptional
upregulation of the tyrosinase family member TYR2 in the ASJ sensory
neurons. TYR2 is secreted by ASJ sensory neurons to antagonize
CEP1-dependent germline apoptosis. Knockdown of the TYR2 homolog TRP2
(also called DCT, 191275) in human melanoma cells similarly increased
apoptosis, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function. Sendoel et
al. (2010) concluded that their findings identified a novel link between
hypoxia and programmed cell death, and provided a paradigm for HIF1
dictating apoptotic cell fate at a distance.

- Role of p53 in Angiogenesis

As normal cells progress toward malignancy, they must switch to an
angiogenic phenotype to attract the vasculature that they depend on for
growth. Dameron et al. (1994) found that the angiogenic switch in
cultured fibroblasts from patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623)
coincided with loss of the wildtype p53 allele and resulted from reduced
expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1, or THBS1; 188060), a potent
inhibitor of angiogenesis. Transfection assays revealed the p53 could
stimulate the endogenous TSP1 gene and positively regulate TSP1 promoter
sequences. Dameron et al. (1994) concluded that wildtype p53 inhibits
angiogenesis in fibroblasts through regulation of TSP1 synthesis.

The earliest genetic alteration in human astrocytoma (see 137800)
progression is mutation of the p53 gene, and one of the earliest
phenotypic changes is stimulation of neovascularization. Van Meir et al.
(1994) tested the role of p53 in angiogenesis by introducing an
inducible wildtype p53 gene into p53-null human glioblastoma cells. The
parental cells exhibited strong angiogenic activity, but upon induction
of wildtype p53 expression, the cells secreted a factor that could
neutralize the angiogenic factors produced by parental cells, as well as
the angiogenic activity of FGF2 (134920).

Teodoro et al. (2006) showed that p53 transcriptionally activated the
alpha-2 collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4HA1; 176710) gene, resulting in
extracellular release of antiangiogenic fragments of collagen types IV
(see 120130) and XVIII (see 120328). Conditioned media from cells
ectopically expressing either p53 or P4HA1 selectively inhibited growth
of primary human endothelial cells. When expressed intracellularly or
exogenously delivered, P4HA1 significantly inhibited tumor growth in
mice. Teodoro et al. (2006) concluded that there is genetic and
biochemical linkage between the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and
synthesis of antiangiogenic collagen fragments.

Sano et al. (2007) found that cardiac angiogenesis was crucially
involved in the adaptive mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy and that p53
accumulation was essential for transition from cardiac hypertrophy to
heart failure. Pressure overload in mice initially promoted vascular
growth in the heart by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1; see
603348)-dependent induction of angiogenic factors, and inhibition of
angiogenesis prevented development of cardiac hypertrophy and induced
systolic dysfunction. Sustained pressure overload induced an
accumulation of p53 that inhibited Hif1 activity and thereby impaired
cardiac angiogenesis and systolic function. Conversely, promoting
cardiac angiogenesis by introducing angiogenic factors or by inhibiting
p53 accumulation developed hypertrophy further and restored cardiac
dysfunction under chronic pressure overload. Sano et al. (2007)
concluded that the antiangiogenic property of p53 may have a crucial
function in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure.

- Role of p53 in Aging

Matheu et al. (2007) showed that genetically manipulated mice with
increased but otherwise normally regulated levels of Arf (600160) and
p53 had strong cancer resistance and decreased levels of
aging-associated damage. They proposed that the spectra of genes
activated by p53 under normal physiologic conditions have a global
antioxidant effect, thus decreasing aging-associated oxidative damage.

- Role of p53 in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Generation

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which have the capacity to form
complete embryos, can be generated from somatic cells by the
introduction of Oct3/4 (164177), Sox2 (184429), Klf4 (602253), and c-Myc
(190080) in mouse and in human. This process is extremely insufficient.
Pluripotency can be induced without c-Myc but with even lower
efficiency. Zhao et al. (2008) demonstrated that an siRNA directed at
p53 was able to promote human iPS cell generation. Hong et al. (2009)
reported that up to 10% of transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts
lacking p53 become iPS cells, even without the Myc retrovirus. The p53
deletion also promoted the induction of integration-free mouse iPS cells
with plasmid transfection. Furthermore, in the p53-null background, iPS
cells were generated from terminally differentiated T lymphocytes. The
suppression of p53 also increased the efficiency of human iPS cell
generation. DNA microarray analyses identified 34 p53-regulated genes
that are common in mouse and human fibroblasts. Functional analyses of
these genes demonstrated that the p53-p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) pathway
serves as a barrier not only in tumorigenicity, but also in iPS cell
generation.

Li et al. (2009) showed that the Ink4/Arf locus, comprising Cdkn2a
(600160)-Cdnk2b (600431), is completely silenced in iPS cells as well as
in embryonic stem cells, acquiring the epigenetic marks of a bivalent
chromatin domain, and retaining the ability to be reactivated after
differentiation. Cell culture conditions during reprogramming enhance
the expression of the Ink4/Arf locus, further highlighting the
importance of silencing the locus to allow proliferation and
reprogramming. Indeed, Oct4, Klf4, and Sox2 together repress the
Ink4/Arf locus soon after their expression and concomitant with the
appearance of the first molecular markers of 'stemness.' This
downregulation also occurs in cells carrying the oncoprotein simian
virus-40 'large-T' antigen, which functionally inactivates the pathways
regulated by the Ink4/Arf locus, thus indicating that the silencing of
the locus is intrinsic to reprogramming and not the result of a
selective process. Genetic inhibition of the Ink4/Arf locus has a
profound positive effect on the efficiency of iPS cell generation,
increasing both the kinetics of reprogramming and the number of emerging
iPS cell colonies. In murine cells, Arf, rather than Ink4a, is the main
barrier to reprogramming by activation of p53 and p21, whereas in human
fibroblasts, INK4a is more important than ARF. Furthermore, organismal
aging upregulates the Ink4/Arf locus, and accordingly, reprogramming is
less efficient in cells from old organisms, but this defect can be
rescued by inhibiting the locus with a short hairpin RNA. Li et al.
(2009) concluded that the silencing of Ink4/Arf locus is rate-limiting
for reprogramming, and its transient inhibition may significantly
improve the generation of iPS cells.

Kawamura et al. (2009) demonstrated that reprogramming factors can
activate the p53 pathway. Reducing signaling to p53 by expressing a
mutated version of one of its negative regulators, by deleting or
knocking down p53 or its target gene p21, or by antagonizing
reprogramming-induced apoptosis in mouse fibroblasts increases
reprogramming efficiency. Notably, decreasing p53 protein levels enabled
fibroblasts to give rise to iPS cells capable of generating
germline-transmitting chimeric mice using only Oct4 and Sox2.
Furthermore, silencing of p53 significantly increased the reprogramming
efficiency of human somatic cells.

Utikal et al. (2009) noted that the reprogramming potential of primary
murine fibroblasts into iPS cells decreases after serial passaging and
the concomitant onset of senescence. They demonstrated that cells with
low endogenous p19(Arf) protein levels and immortal fibroblasts
deficient in components of the Arf-Trp53 pathway yield iPS cell colonies
with up to 3-fold faster kinetics and at a significantly higher
efficiency than wildtype cells, endowing almost every somatic cell with
the potential to form iPS cells. Notably, the acute genetic ablation of
p53 in cellular subpopulations that normally fail to reprogram rescues
their ability to produce iPS cells. The results of Utikal et al. (2009)
showed that the acquisition of immortality is a crucial and
rate-limiting step towards the establishment of a pluripotent state in
somatic cells and underscored the similarities between induced
pluripotency and tumorigenesis.

Marion et al. (2009) showed that p53 is critically involved in
preventing the reprogramming of cells carrying various types of DNA
damage, including short telomeres, DNA repair deficiencies, or
exogenously inflicted DNA damage. Reprogramming in the presence of
preexisting, but tolerated, DNA damage is aborted by the activation of a
DNA damage response and p53-dependent apoptosis. Abrogation of p53
allows efficient reprogramming in the face of DNA damage and the
generation of iPS cells carrying persistent DNA damage and chromosomal
aberrations. Marion et al. (2009) concluded that during reprogramming,
cells increase their intolerance to different types of DNA damage and
that p53 is critical in preventing the generation of human and mouse
pluripotent cells from suboptimal parental cells.

- Regulation of p53 by MDM2 and Ubiquitination

Fuchs et al. (1998) stated that direct association of p53 with the
cellular protein MDM2 (164785) results in ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation of p53.

Yin et al. (2002) found that MDM2 induced translation of p53 mRNA from 2
alternative initiation sites, resulting in full-length p53 and an
N-terminally truncated protein, p53/47. p53/47 lacks the MDM2-binding
site and the most N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of
full-length p53. Translation induction required MDM2 to interact
directly with the nascent p53 polypeptide and led to a change in the
ratio of p53 to p53/47 by inducing translation of both proteins followed
by selective degradation of full-length p53.

By mass spectrometry of affinity-purified p53-associated factors, Li et
al. (2002) identified the herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific
protease (HAUSP; 602519) as a novel p53-interacting protein. HAUSP
strongly stabilized p53, even in the presence of excess MDM2, and
induced p53-dependent cell growth repression and apoptosis. HAUSP had an
intrinsic enzymatic activity that specifically deubiquitinated p53 both
in vivo and in vitro. Expression of a catalytically inactive point
mutation of HAUSP in cells increased the levels of p53 ubiquitination
and also destabilized p53. Li et al. (2002) concluded that p53 can be
stabilized by direct deubiquitination and suggested that HAUSP may
function as a tumor suppressor in vivo through stabilization of p53.

Both p53 and MDM2 interact with p300 (EP300; 602700)/CREB-binding
protein (CBP; 600140) transcriptional coactivators. Grossman et al.
(2003) observed that purified p300 exhibited intrinsic ubiquitin ligase
activity. In vitro, p300 with MDM2 catalyzed p53 polyubiquitination,
whereas MDM2 alone catalyzed p53 monoubiquitination. Grossman et al.
(2003) concluded that generation of the polyubiquitinated forms of p53
that are targeted for proteasome degradation requires the intrinsic
ubiquitin ligase activities of MDM2 and p300.

Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay with mouse and human UBE4B
(613565) and MDM2, Wu et al. (2011) showed that either UBE4B or MDM2
alone led to monoubiquitination of p53, while UBE4B in combination with
MDM2 promoted p53 polyubiquitination. Overexpression and knockdown
studies in mouse and human cell lines revealed that interaction of UBE4B
with MDM2 reduced the half-life of p53 via proteasome-mediated
degradation and caused repression of p53-dependent transactivation and
apoptosis.

Colaluca et al. (2008) described a previously unknown function for human
NUMB (603728) as a regulator of tumor protein p53. NUMB enters in a
tricomplex with p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 thereby preventing
ubiquitination and degradation of p53. This results in increased p53
protein levels and activity, and in regulation of p53-dependent
phenotypes. In breast cancers there is frequent loss of NUMB expression.
Colaluca et al. (2008) showed that, in primary breast tumor cells, this
event causes decreased p53 levels and increased chemoresistance. In
breast cancers, loss of NUMB expression causes increased activity of the
receptor Notch (190198). Thus, in these cancers, a single event--loss of
NUMB expression--determines activation of an oncogene (NOTCH1) and
attenuation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Biologically, this
results in an aggressive tumor phenotype, as witnessed by findings that
NUMB-defective breast tumors display poor prognosis.

Le Cam et al. (2006) found that human E4F1 (603022) functioned as as a
ubiquitin E3 ligase for p53 both in vitro and in vivo. E4F1-mediated
ubiquitylation of p53 occurred at sites distinct from those targeted by
MDM2, competed with PCAF (602303)-induced acetylation of p53, and did
not target p53 for proteasomal degradation. E4F1-stimulated
p53-ubiquitin conjugates were associated with chromatin, and their
stimulation coincided with induction of a p53-dependent transcriptional
program specifically involved in cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis.
Le Cam et al. (2006) concluded that E4F1 is a key posttranslational
regulator of p53 that plays an important role in the cellular
life-or-death decision controlled by p53.

Impeding ribosomal biogenesis generates ribosomal stress that activates
p53 to stop cell growth. Dai et al. (2006) stated that the ribosomal
proteins L5 (RPL5; 603634), L11 (RPL11; 604175), and L23 (RPL23; 603662)
interact with MDM2 and inhibit MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and
degradation in response to ribosomal stress. They found that L5 and L23
inhibited ubiquitination of both p53 and MDM2 in human cell lines. In
contrast, L11 inhibited proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated
MDM2, but not p53, resulting in stabilization of p53.

Using Tctp (TPT1; 600763)-haploinsufficient mice and mouse cells and
human cell lines, Amson et al. (2012) found that TCTP had an
antiapoptotic function by promoting MDM2-dependent ubiquitination and
proteasome-dependent degradation of p53. TCTP also interacted directly
with NUMB, and Amson et al. (2012) suggested that TCTP may compete with
NUMB for binding to the MDM2-p53 complex. On the other hand, p53 bound
to the promoter region of TCTP and repressed TCTP transcription,
suggesting a negative-feedback loop between TCTP and p53 for the control
of cell and tumor growth.

- Regulation of p53 by Phosphorylation

Shieh et al. (1997) showed that, upon DNA damage, p53 was phosphorylated
at ser15 and that this event led to reduced interaction of p53 with its
negative regulator, MDM2 (164785). Furthermore, phosphorylation of p53
at ser15 and ser37 by purified DNA-dependent protein kinase (see 600899)
impaired the ability of MDM2 to inhibit p53-dependent transactivation.
Shieh et al. (1997) concluded that these effects were most likely due to
a conformational change induced by phosphorylation of p53. Shieh et al.
(1997) proposed that under normal unstressed conditions, p53 associates
with MDM2, and p53-dependent transactivation is repressed. Upon DNA
damage, p53 is phosphorylated at ser15, which induces a conformational
change that makes MDM2 unable to bind p53, relieving the inhibitory
effect of MDM2 on p53.

Oda et al. (2000) identified an apoptosis-inducing gene, p53AIP1
(605426), whose expression was induced by wildtype p53. Upon severe DNA
damage, ser46 on p53 was phosphorylated, leading to induction of
apoptosis. Substitution of ser46 inhibited the ability of p53 to induce
apoptosis and selectively blocked expression of p53AIP1. Oda et al.
(2000) concluded that p53AIP1 mediates p53-dependent apoptosis and that
phosphorylation of ser46 on p53 regulates transcriptional activation of
p53AIP1.

Okamura et al. (2001) found that overexpression of P53DINP1 (606185) and
DNA damage induced by double-strand breaks synergistically enhanced
ser46 phosphorylation of p53, induction of p53AIP1, and apoptotic cell
death. P53DINP1 interacted with a protein complex that phosphorylated
p53 on ser46.

Hirao et al. (2000) found that Chk2 (604373) -/- mouse embryonic cells
were defective for p53 stabilization and for induction of p53-dependent
transcripts, such as p21, in response to gamma irradiation.
Reintroduction of the Chk2 gene restored p53-dependent transcription in
response to gamma irradiation. Human CHK2 directly phosphorylated p53 on
ser20, a modification known to interfere with MDM2 binding. Hirao et al.
(2000) concluded that phosphorylation of p53 by CHK2 increases p53
stability by preventing ubiquitination in response to DNA damage. The
results provided a mechanistic link between CHK2 and p53 to explain the
phenotypic similarity of Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (LFS1; 151623), which is
caused by mutations in p53, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome-2 (LFS2; 609265),
which is caused by mutations in CHK2.

Phosphorylation of the human p53 protein at ser392 is responsive to UV
but not gamma irradiation. Keller et al. (2001) identified and purified
a mammalian UV-activated protein kinase complex that phosphorylated
ser392 in vitro. This kinase complex contained casein kinase-2 (CK2; see
115441) and the chromatin transcriptional elongation factor FACT, a
heterodimer of SPT16 (605012) and SSRP1 (604328). In vitro studies
showed that FACT altered the specificity of CK2 in the complex such that
it selectively phosphorylated p53 over other substrates, including
casein, and phosphorylation by the kinase complex enhanced p53 activity.

Zhang and Xiong (2001) identified a nuclear export signal in the N
terminus of p53 containing 2 serines that were phosphorylated after DNA
damage. The N-terminal signal was required for p53 nuclear export in
collaboration with the C-terminal nuclear export signal.
Serine-15-phosphorylated p53 induced by UV irradiation was not exported.
Zhang and Xiong (2001) concluded that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation
may achieve optimal p53 activation by inhibiting both MDM2 binding to,
and nuclear export of, p53.

Expression of oncogenic RAS (HRAS; 190020) mutants, such as HRASV12 (see
190020.0001), in primary human cells activates p53, thereby protecting
cells from transformation. Bulavin et al. (2002) showed that p38 MAPK
(MAPK14; 600289) phosphorylated p53 at ser33 and ser46 in a human
fibroblast cell line expressing oncogenic RAS. The activity of p38 MAPK
was regulated by the p53-inducible phosphatase PPM1D (605100), creating
a potential feedback loop. Expression of oncogenic Ras suppressed PPM1D
mRNA induction, leaving p53 phosphorylated at ser33 and ser46 and in an
active state. Overexpression of PPM1D reduced p53 phosphorylation at
these sites, which abrogated RAS-induced apoptosis and partially rescued
cells from cell-cycle arrest.

Hofmann et al. (2002) and D'Orazi et al. (2002) found that HIPK2
(606868) colocalized and interacted with p53 and CBP (CREBBP; 600140)
within promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Activation of HIPK2 by UV
radiation led to phosphorylation of p53 at ser46, facilitating
CBP-mediated acetylation of p53 at lys382 and promoting p53-dependent
gene expression.

Rinaldo et al. (2007) stated that phosphorylation of p53 on ser46 shifts
the affinity of p53 for promoters of genes involved in cell cycle arrest
to promoters of genes involved in apoptosis. They observed that lethal
DNA damage increased HIPK2 expression, whereas sublethal DNA damage
repressed HIPK2 expression. Rinaldo et al. (2007) identified HIPK2 as a
target for MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation and found that
HIPK2 degradation only occurred in growth-arresting conditions when MDM2
was efficiently induced by p53.

Taira et al. (2007) found that DYRK2 (603496) phosphorylated p53 on
ser46 in vitro and in human cells. Upon exposure to genotoxic stress,
DYRK2 translocated into the nucleus and phosphorylated p53 on ser46,
inducing P53AIP1 expression and apoptosis in a ser46
phosphorylation-dependent manner.

Cordenonsi et al. (2007) found that RTK/Ras/MAPK activity induced p53
N-terminal phosphorylation, enabling interaction of p53 with TGF-beta
(190180)-activated SMADs (see 601595). This mechanism confined mesoderm
specification in Xenopus embryos and promoted TGF-beta cytostasis in
human cells.

- Regulation of p53 by Acetylation

Luo et al. (2000) found that deacetylation of p53 was mediated by a
histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1; 601241)-containing complex, and they
purified a p53 target protein, MTA1L1 (603947), in the deacetylase
complexes. MTA1L1, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone
deacetylation (NURD) complex, specifically interacted with p53 in vitro
and in vivo. Expression of MTA1L1 reduced steady-state levels of
acetylated p53, repressed p53-dependent transcriptional activation, and
modulated p53-mediated cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Luo et al.
(2000) concluded that deacetylation and functional interactions between
the MTA1L1-associated NURD complex may represent an important pathway to
regulate p53 function.

Pearson et al. (2000) found that the tumor suppressor PML (102578)
regulated the p53 response to oncogenic signals. Oncogenic RAS (HRAS;
190020) upregulated PML expression, and overexpression of PML induced
senescence in a p53-dependent manner. p53 was acetylated at lys382 upon
RAS expression, an event essential for its biologic function. RAS
induced relocalization of p53 and the CBP (CREBBP; 600140)
acetyltransferase within PML nuclear bodies and induced formation of a
trimeric p53-PML-CBP complex. RAS-induced p53 acetylation, p53-CBP
complex stabilization, and senescence were lost in PML -/- fibroblasts.
Pearson et al. (2000) concluded that their there is a link between PML
and p53 and that integrity of PML bodies is required for p53 acetylation
and senescence upon oncogene expression.

Vaziri et al. (2001) found that SIRT1 (604479) bound and deacetylated
p53 specifically at lys382, modification of which is implicated in
activation of p53 as a transcription factor. Expression of wildtype
SIRT1 in human cells reduced p53 transcriptional activity. In contrast,
expression of a catalytically inactive SIRT1 protein potentiated
p53-dependent apoptosis and radiosensitivity.

Luo et al. (2001) found that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) inhibited
NAD-dependent p53 deacetylation induced by SIRT1 and also enhanced p53
acetylation levels in vivo. SIRT1 repressed p53-dependent apoptosis in
response to DNA damage and oxidative stress, whereas expression of a
SIRT1 point mutant increased the sensitivity of cells in the stress
response.

Using a yeast p53 dissociator assay with a HeLa cell expression library,
Wang et al. (2001) identified ADA3 (TADA3L; 602945), a part of histone
acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, as a cofactor for p53 activity. ADA3
and p53 interacted directly in cotransfected cells. Mutation analysis
showed that the N terminus of ADA3 interacted with the N terminus of
p53, while the C terminus of ADA3 interacted with ADA2 (TADA2L; 602276)
and p300 (EP300; 602700), components of HAT complexes. Following DNA
damage, p53 was phosphorylated at its N terminus, and this enhanced the
amount of p53 that could be coimmunoprecipitated with ADA3. The N
terminus of ADA3 alone could inhibit p53 transcriptional activity and
prevent p53-mediated apoptosis. Wang et al. (2001) concluded that ADA3
function is essential for full transcriptional activity of p53 and
p53-mediated apoptosis.

Tang et al. (2006) found that lys120 (K120) within the DNA-binding
domain of p53 was acetylated in several human cell lines, and that
acetylation of K120 was significantly enhanced upon DNA damage. This
modification of p53 was catalyzed by TIP60 (601409). A tumor-derived p53
mutant defective for TIP60-mediated acetylation, lys120 to arg (K120R),
abrogated p53-dependent activation of apoptosis but had no significant
effect on cell growth arrest.

Sykes et al. (2006) showed that the p53 K120R mutation selectively
blocked transcription of proapoptotic target genes such as BAX (600040)
and PUMA (605854). Depletion of TIP60 or MOF (MYST1; 609912), another
enzyme that can acetylate p53 at K120, inhibited the ability of p53 to
activate BAX and PUMA transcription. Sykes et al. (2006) showed that the
acetyl-K120 form of p53 specifically accumulated at proapoptotic target
genes.

Upon DNA damage, p53 is acetylated by CBP at K373 and K382, by PCAF
(602303) at K320, and by TIP60 at K120. This acetylation enhances the
ability of p53 to bind DNA and recruit transcriptional coactivators to
p53-responsive promoters. Li et al. (2007) showed that acetylation of
K373 and K382 on p53 led to their direct interaction with the tandem
bromodomains of TAF1 (313650). p53 recruited TAF1 to a distal
p53-binding site on the p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) promoter prior to the DNA
looping that brings TAF1 to the TATA box-containing core promoter.

Tang et al. (2008) identified K164 as an additional site for acetylation
of full-length human p53 by CBP/p300. K164 is a conserved residue
located in the L2 loop of the DNA-binding core domain of p53. Although
acetylation defects at each individual site (K164, K120, and the 6
C-terminal lysines) could be compensated by acetylation at other sites,
loss of acetylation at all of these major sites completely abolished the
ability of p53 to activate p21 and suppress cell growth. Acetylation
blocked the interaction of p53 with its repressors MDM2 and MDMX (MDM4;
602704) on the p21 promoter, and this directly resulted in p53
activation regardless of its phosphorylation status. In addition,
inactivation of MDM2 and MDMX restored the transcriptional functions of
unacetylated p53.

- Regulation of p53 by Methylation

Chuikov et al. (2004) reported that SET9 (606594) specifically
methylated p53 at lys372 within the C-terminal regulatory region in
human cells. Methylated p53 was restricted to the nucleus, and the
modification stabilized p53. SET9 regulated expression of p53 target
genes in a manner dependent on the p53 methylation site.

Huang et al. (2006) reported that SMYD2 (610663) methylated lys370 in
p53. In contrast to methylation of lys372, methylation of lys370
repressed p53-mediated transcriptional regulation by maintaining low
concentrations of promoter-associated p53. Reduction of SMYD2 by siRNA
enhanced p53-mediated apoptosis. SET9-mediated methylation of lys372
inhibited SMYD2-mediated methylation of lys370, in part, by blocking
interaction between p53 and SMYD2. Huang et al. (2006) concluded that,
similar to histones, p53 is subject to both activating and repressing
lysine methylation.

Huang et al. (2007) demonstrated that in human cells the histone
lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 (609132) interacts with p53 to repress
p53-mediated transcriptional activation, and to inhibit the role of p53
in promoting apoptosis. They found that in vitro, LSD1 removes both
monomethylation (K370me1) and dimethylation (K370me2) at K370, a
SMYD2-dependent monomethylation site (Huang et al., 2006). However, in
vivo, LSD1 showed a strong preference to reverse K370me2, which is
performed by a distinct methyltransferase. Huang et al. (2007) concluded
that K370me2 has a different role in regulating p53 from that of
K370me1: K370me1 represses p53 function, whereas K370me2 promotes
association with the coactivator 53BP1 (605230). The observations of
Huang et al. (2007) showed that p53 is dynamically regulated by lysine
methylation and demethylation and that the methylation status at a
single lysine residue confers distinct regulatory output.

Shi et al. (2007) showed that SET8 (SETD8; 607240) monomethylated p53 in
human cell lines. This monomethylation suppressed p53-mediated
transcriptional activation of highly responsive target genes, such as
p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and PUMA (BBC3; 605854), but it had little
influence on weak p53 targets. Depletion of SET8 augmented the
proapoptotic and checkpoint activation functions of p53, and SET8
expression was downregulated upon DNA damage.

- Regulation of p53 by MicroRNAs

Le et al. (2009) identified highly conserved miRNA response elements in
the 3-prime UTRs of zebrafish and human p53 transcripts and showed that
MIR125B (see 610105) bound directly to these elements. MIR125B repressed
translation of endogenous p53, reduced expression of p53 target genes,
and countered drug-induced apoptosis in human cells. Knockdown of
mir125b in zebrafish embryos resulted in severe developmental defects,
particularly accumulation of dead cells in the brain, and loss of
mir125b increased p53 protein and p53-dependent apoptosis. Treatment of
zebrafish embryos with DNA-damaging agents resulted in downregulation of
mir125b and a rapid increase in p53 protein. Le et al. (2009) concluded
that MIR125B is an important negative regulator of p53 and p53-induced
apoptosis during development and during the stress response.

Swarbrick et al. (2010) identified 2 highly conserved putative miR380-5p
(MIR380*; 613654)-binding regions in the 3-prime UTR of the p53
transcript. Using knockdown and overexpression studies with mouse and
human cells and cell lines, they showed that miR380-5p negatively
regulated p53 expression at the translational level and countered the
apoptotic function of p53 in neuroblastoma cells.

- Other p53 Regulators

By immunoprecipitation and binding analyses, Lu and Levine (1995) showed
that TAF9 (600822) interacted with the N-terminal domain of p53 at sites
identical to those bound by MDM2 (164785). Antibodies to TAF9 inhibited
p53-activated transcription. Lu and Levine (1995) concluded that p53
activity is regulated by MDM2 and TAF9 competing for the same region of
the p53 protein.

Based on evidence for JNK (602896) association with p53, Fuchs et al.
(1998) sought to elucidate the role of nonactive JNK2 in regulating p53
stability. The amount of p53-JNK complex was inversely correlated with
the p53 level in nonstressed mouse fibroblasts. A peptide corresponding
to the JNK-binding site on p53 inhibited JNK binding and efficiently
blocked ubiquitination of p53. Similarly, p53 lacking the JNK-binding
site exhibited a longer half-life than wildtype p53. Outcompeting JNK
association with p53 increased the level of p53, whereas overexpression
of a phosphorylation mutant form of JNK inhibited p53 accumulation.
JNK-p53 and MDM2-p53 complexes were preferentially found in G0/G1 and
S/G2M phases of the cell cycle, respectively. Fuchs et al. (1998)
concluded that JNK is an MDM2-independent regulator of p53 stability in
nonstressed cells.

Bernal et al. (2002) identified securin (PTTG1; 604147) as a negative
regulator of p53. Assays demonstrated that p53 interacted specifically
with securin both in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction blocked
specific binding of p53 to DNA and inhibited its transcriptional
activity. Securin also inhibited the ability of p53 to induce cell
death. Transfection of human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells with
securin induced an accumulation of cells in G2 that compensated for the
loss of G2 cells caused by transfection with p53. Both apoptotic and
transactivating functions of p53 were potentiated in securin-deficient
human tumor cells cells compared with parental cells.

Zacchi et al. (2002) found that, on DNA damage, p53 interacted with PIN1
(601052), a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that regulates proteins involved
in cell cycle control and apoptosis. The interaction was strictly
dependent on DNA damage-induced p53 phosphorylation and required ser33,
thr81, and ser315. On binding, PIN1 generated conformational changes in
p53 that enhanced its transactivation activity. Stabilization of p53 was
impaired in UV-treated Pin1 -/- mouse cells owing to the inability of
p53 to efficiently dissociate from MDM2. As a consequence, Pin1 -/-
cells exhibited a reduced p53-dependent response to DNA damage that
correlated with diminished transcriptional activation of p53-regulated
genes. Zheng et al. (2002) presented similar findings and showed that
PIN1-mediated p53 activation required the WW domain and isomerase
activity of PIN1.

Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2005) found that S100B (176990) and S100A4
(114210) bound the C-terminal tetramerization domain of p53 when the
domain was exposed in lower oligomerization states, disrupting p53
tetramerization. S100B also bound to the negative regulatory and nuclear
localization domains of p53, resulting in tight binding. Because
trafficking of p53 depends on its oligomerization state,
Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2005) proposed that S100B and S100A4 may
regulate subcellular localization of p53 but with different effects on
p53 function in cell cycle control due to their differences in binding
p53.

Barral et al. (2005) showed that E1BAP5 (HNRNPUL1; 605800), a
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family member, interacted
directly with p53 and inhibited induction of p53-regulated genes
following UV irradiation.

Zhang et al. (2013) showed that the long intergenic noncoding RNA ROR
(LINC-ROR; 615173) suppressed induction of cellular p53 after DNA damage
in human cell lines and inhibited p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. ROR had little effect on p53 in the absence of DNA damage.
ROR repression of p53 depended upon direct interaction of ROR with
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein I (hnRNP I, or PTBP1; 600693).
ROR predominantly interacted with phosphorylated hnRNP I in the
cytoplasm. Knockdown of ROR increased DNA damage-induced p53 expression,
whereas knockdown of hnRNP I reduced DNA damage-induced p53 expression.
Qualitative RT-PCR revealed that p53 transcriptionally induced
expression of ROR, resulting in a negative-feedback loop.

- Activation of p53 by Meiotic Recombination

Using genetic reporters as proxies to follow in vivo activation of the
p53 network in Drosophila, Lu et al. (2010) discovered that the process
of meiotic recombination instigates programmed activation of p53 in the
germline. Specifically, double-stranded breaks in DNA generated by the
topoisomerase Spo11 (605114) provoked functional p53 activity, which was
prolonged in cells defective for meiotic DNA repair. This intrinsic
stimulus for the p53 regulatory network is highly conserved, as
Spo11-dependent activation of p53 also occurs in mice. Lu et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings established a physiologic role for p53 in
meiosis and suggested that tumor-suppressive functions may have been
co-opted from primordial activities linked to recombination.

- Role of p53 in Carcinogenesis

Chen et al. (1990) introduced single copies of exogenous p53 genes
containing either point-mutated or wildtype versions of the p53 cDNA
sequence into a human osteosarcoma cell line lacking endogenous p53 by
infecting the cells with recombinant retroviruses. Expression of
wildtype p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype. In a 2-allele
configuration, wildtype p53 was phenotypically dominant to mutated p53.

Halevy et al. (1990) demonstrated that the ability of a p53 mutant to
bind endogenous p53 is not the sole determinant of its oncogenic
potential. They concluded that p53 mutants involved in the neoplastic
process display various properties, including gain of function.

In tumors showing rapid growth, hexokinase-2 (HK2; 601125) is highly
expressed to facilitate high rates of glucose catabolism, which promote
rapid tumor proliferation. Mathupala et al. (1997) cloned p53 from the
AS-30D rat hepatoma cell line and identified 2 point mutations at the
periphery of the p53 core DNA-binding domain. Using coexpression
studies, they showed that overexpressed mutant p53 significantly and
reproducibly activated the HK2 promoter and increased gene expression.
The findings were consistent with reports describing the transactivating
effects of p53 on various genes (Unger et al., 1992; Chumakov et al.,
1993; Zhang et al., 1993), but they contrasted with reports that mutant
p53 functions in tumor cells only to prevent wildtype p53 from
transactivating genes involved in suppressing cell proliferation (Fields
and Jang, 1990; Farmer et al., 1992).

Raman et al. (2000) found low p53 mRNA levels in a large proportion of
breast tumors. They identified consensus HOX-binding sites in the p53
promoter and found that transient transfection of HOXA5 (142952)
activated the p53 promoter. Expression of HOXA5 in epithelial cancer
cells expressing wildtype p53, but not in isogenic variants lacking p53,
led to apoptotic cell death. Moreover, breast cancer cell lines and
patient tumors displayed a coordinate loss of p53 and HOXA5 mRNA and
protein expression. The HOXA5 promoter region was methylated in 16 of 20
p53-negative breast tumor specimens. Raman et al. (2000) concluded that
loss of p53 expression in human breast cancer may be primarily due to
lack of HOXA5 expression.

Constitutive activation of JAK2 (147796) is frequently detected in human
cancers. Reid et al. (2004) found that reintroduction of p53 in 2 human
ovarian cancer cell lines with mutant p53 and high levels of
phosphorylated JAK2 upregulated protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTPN1;
176885), reduced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and induced apoptosis.

Using mouse and human cells, Insinga et al. (2004) showed that the acute
promyelocytic leukemia-associated fusion proteins PML/RAR (see PML;
102578) and PLZF/RAR (see ZNF145; 176797) directly inhibited p53,
allowing leukemic blasts to evade p53-dependent cancer surveillance
pathways. PML/RAR expression led to p53 deacetylation and
destabilization, resulting in MDM2 (164785)-mediated p53 degradation.
Protection of PML/RAR-expressing cells from the p53-dependent genotoxic
stress response depended on the presence of wildtype PML, suggesting
that PML/RAR acts as a gain-of-function mutation.

Bartkova et al. (2005) showed that in clinical specimens from different
stages of human tumors of urinary bladder, breast, lung, and colon, the
early precursor lesions, but not normal tissues, commonly expressed
markers of an activated DNA damage response. These included
phosphorylated kinases ATM (607585) and CHK2 (604373) and phosphorylated
histone H2AX (601772) and p53. Similar checkpoint responses were induced
in cultured cells upon expression of different oncogenes that deregulate
DNA replication. Together with genetic analyses, including a genomewide
assessment of allelic imbalances, Bartkova et al. (2005) concluded that
early in tumorigenesis, before genomic instability and malignant
conversion, human cells activate an ATR/ATM-regulated DNA damage
response network that delays or prevents cancer. Mutations compromising
this checkpoint, including defects in the ATM-CHK2-p53 pathway, might
allow cell proliferation, survival, increased genomic instability, and
tumor progression.

Gorgoulis et al. (2005) analyzed a panel of human lung hyperplasias that
retained wildtype p53 genes and had no signs of gross chromosomal
instability and found signs of a DNA damage response, including histone
H2AX and CHK2 phosphorylation, p53 accumulation, focal staining of p53
binding protein-1 (53BP1; 605230), and apoptosis. Progression to
carcinoma was associated with p53 or 53BP1 inactivation and decreased
apoptosis. A DNA damage response was also observed in dysplastic nevi
and in human skin xenografts, in which hyperplasia was induced by
overexpression of growth factors. Both lung and experimentally-induced
skin hyperplasias showed allelic imbalance at loci prone to DNA
double-strand break formation when DNA replication is compromised
(common fragile sites). Gorgoulis et al. (2005) proposed that, from its
earliest stages, cancer development is associated with DNA replication
stress, which leads to DNA double-strand breaks, genomic instability,
and selective pressure for p53 mutations.

Fujiwara et al. (2005) transiently blocked cytokinesis in p53-null mouse
mammary epithelial cells, enabling isolation of diploid and tetraploid
cultures. Tetraploid cells had an increased frequency of
whole-chromosome missegregation and chromosomal rearrangements, and only
tetraploid cells were transformed in vitro after exposure to carcinogen.
In the absence of carcinogen, only tetraploid cells gave rise to
malignant mammary epithelial cancers when transplanted subcutaneously
into nude mice. These tumors all contained numerous nonreciprocal
translocations and an 8- to 30-fold amplification of a chromosomal
region containing a cluster of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes,
overexpression of which had been linked to mammary tumors in humans and
in animal models (Egeblad and Werb, 2002). Fujiwara et al. (2005)
concluded that tetraploidy enhances the frequency of chromosomal
alterations and promotes tumor development in p53-null mouse mammary
epithelial cells.

Chen et al. (2005) showed that conditional inactivation of Trp53 in
mouse prostate failed to produce a tumor phenotype, whereas complete
Pten (601728) inactivation in prostate triggered nonlethal invasive
prostate cancer after long latency. Strikingly, combined inactivation of
Pten and Trp53 elicited invasive prostate cancer as early as 2 weeks
after puberty and was invariably lethal by 7 months of age. Acute Pten
inactivation induced growth arrest through the p53-dependent cellular
senescence pathway both in vitro and in vivo, which could be fully
rescued by combined loss of Trp53. In addition, Chen et al. (2005)
detected evidence of cellular senescence in specimens from early-stage
human prostate cancer. They concluded that cellular senescence plays a
role in restricting tumorigenesis in vivo and that p53 is an essential
failsafe protein of Pten-deficient tumors.

Laurie et al. (2006) showed that the tumor surveillance pathway mediated
by ARF (see 600160), MDM2, MDMX (602704), and p53 was activated after
loss of RB1 during retinogenesis in mouse and human. RB1-deficient
retinoblasts underwent p53-mediated apoptosis and exited the cell cycle.
Subsequently, amplification of the MDMX gene and increased expression of
MDMX protein were strongly selected for during tumor progression as a
mechanism to suppress the p53 response in RB1-deficient retinal cells.
Laurie et al. (2006) concluded that the p53 pathway is inactivated in
retinoblastoma and that this cancer does not originate from
intrinsically death-resistant cells, as had been thought.

Matoba et al. (2006) found that p53 modulated the balance between the
use of respiratory and glycolytic pathways. They identified SCO2
(604272), which is critical for regulating the COX complex, the major
site of oxygen use in the eukaryotic cell, as the downstream mediator of
this effect in mice and human cancer cell lines. Disruption of the SCO2
gene in human cancer cells with wildtype p53 recapitulated the metabolic
switch toward glycolysis exhibited by p53-deficient cells. Matoba et al.
(2006) concluded that the coupling of p53 to mitochondrial respiration
by SCO2 provides a possible explanation for the Warburg effect, in which
cancer cells preferentially use glycolytic pathways for energy
generation while downregulating their aerobic respiratory activity.

Ventura et al. (2007) showed that restoring endogenous p53 expression
led to regression of autochthonous lymphomas and sarcomas in mice
without affecting normal tissues. The main consequence of p53
restoration was apoptosis in lymphomas and suppression of cell growth
with features of cellular senescence in sarcomas. Ventura et al. (2007)
concluded that sustained p53 inactivation is required for tumor
maintenance.

Feng et al. (2007) found evidence that increased tumor incidence with
age may be due to reduced p53 function in older populations. They showed
that p53 responses to gamma irradiation and other stresses were reduced
in aging mice and in cultured splenocytes from older mice, which
included decreased p53 transcriptional activity and p53-dependent
apoptosis. The function of Atm declined significantly with age, which
may be responsible for reduced p53 activity. The time of onset of
decreased p53 response correlated with the life span of mice; mice that
lived longer delayed their onset of decreased p53 activity.

Foo et al. (2007) noted that only about one-half of cancers have p53
loss-of-function mutations. They demonstrated that the apoptotic
function of wildtype p53 was inactivated by binding to ARC (NOL3;
605235) in the nucleus of human cancer cell lines. ARC bound to the p53
tetramerization domain, which inhibited p53 tetramerization and exposed
a nuclear export signal in p53, leading to CRM1 (XPO1; 602559)-dependent
relocation of p53 to the cytoplasm. Knockdown of endogenous ARC in
breast cancer cells resulted in spontaneous tetramerization of
endogenous p53, accumulation of p53 in the nucleus, and activation of
endogenous p53 target genes. In primary human breast cancers with
nuclear ARC, p53 was almost always wildtype. Conversely, nearly all
breast cancers with mutant p53 lacked nuclear ARC. Foo et al. (2007)
concluded that nuclear ARC is induced in cancer cells and negatively
regulates p53.

The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2008) reported the interim
integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression, and DNA
methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas (137800) and nucleotide
sequence alterations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. The authors found
that p53 itself showed mutation or homozygous deletion in 35% of tumors
and that there was altered p53 signaling in 87% of tumors, as
demonstrated by homozygous deletion or mutations in CDKN2A in 49% of
tumors, amplification of MDM2 in 14%, and amplification of MDM4 in 7%.

Zheng et al. (2008) showed that concomitant central nervous
system-specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse central nervous
system generates a penetrant acute-onset high grade malignant glioma
phenotype with notable clinical, pathologic, and molecular resemblance
to primary glioblastoma in humans. This genetic observation prompted
TP53 and PTEN mutation analysis in human primary glioblastoma,
demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of TP53 as
well as the expected PTEN mutations. Integrated transcriptomic
profiling, in silico promoter analysis, and functional studies of murine
neural stem cells established that dual, but not singular, inactivation
of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal
potential and drives increased Myc (190080) protein levels and its
associated signature. Functional studies validated increased Myc
activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and
enhanced renewal of neural stem cells doubly null for p53 and Pten
(p53-/-Pten-/-) as well as tumor neurospheres derived from this model.
Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of
p53-/-Pten-/- tumor neurospheres. These murine modeling studies,
together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human
primary glioblastoma, validated a pathogenetic role of a common tumor
suppressor mutation profile in human primary glioblastoma and
established Myc as an important target for cooperative actions of p53
and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell
differentiation, self-renewal, and tumorigenic potential.

Junttila et al. (2010) modeled the probable therapeutic impact of p53
restoration in a spontaneously evolving mouse model of nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) initiated by sporadic oncogenic activation of the
endogenous KRAS (190070) developed by Jackson et al. (2001).
Surprisingly, p53 restoration failed to induce significant regression of
established tumors, although it did result in a significant decrease in
the relative proportion of high-grade tumors. This was due to selective
activation of p53 only in the more aggressive tumor cells within each
tumor. Such selective activation of p53 correlates with marked
upregulation in Ras signal intensity and induction of the oncogenic
signaling sensor p19(ARF) (600160). Junttila et al. (2010) concluded
that p53-mediated tumor suppression is triggered only when oncogenic Ras
signal flux exceeds a critical threshold. Importantly, the failure of
low-level oncogenic Kras to engage p53 reveals inherent limits in the
capacity of p53 to restrain early tumor evolution and in the efficacy of
therapeutic p53 restoration to eradicate cancers.

Feldser et al. (2010) showed that restoration of p53 in established
murine lung tumors leads to significant but incomplete tumor cell loss
specifically in malignant adenocarcinomas, but not in adenomas. They
defined amplification of MAPK signaling as a critical determinant of
malignant progression and also a stimulator of Arf tumor suppressor
expression. The response to p53 restoration in this context is
critically dependent on the expression of Arf. Feldser et al. (2010)
proposed that p53 not only limits malignant progression by suppressing
the acquisition of alterations that lead to tumor progression, but also,
in the context of p53 restoration, responds to increased oncogenic
signaling to mediate tumor regression. Their observations underscored
that the p53 pathway is not engaged by low levels of oncogene activity
that are sufficient for early stages of lung tumor development. Feldser
et al. (2010) concluded that restoration of pathways important in tumor
progression, as opposed to initiation, may lead to incomplete tumor
regression due to the stage-heterogeneity of tumor cell populations.

Maddocks et al. (2013) showed that human cancer cells rapidly use
exogenous serine and that serine deprivation triggered activation of the
serine synthesis pathway and rapidly suppressed aerobic glycolysis,
resulting in an increased flux to the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
Transient p53-p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) activation and cell-cycle arrest
promoted cell survival by efficiently channeling depleted serine stores
to glutathione synthesis, thus preserving cellular antioxidant capacity.
Cells lacking p53 failed to complete the response to serine depletion,
resulting in oxidative stress, reduced viability, and severely impaired
proliferation. The role of p53 in supporting cancer cell proliferation
under serine starvation was translated to an in vivo model, indicating
that serine depletion has a potential role in the treatment of
p53-deficient tumors.

To investigate the relationship between epigenetic changes and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations in breast cancer patients lacking
a TP53 mutation, Barekati et al. (2010) screened triple-matched samples
(cancerous tissues, matched adjacent normal tissues, and serum samples)
from breast cancer patients for TP53 mutations, and analyzed the
promoter methylation profile of p14(ARF) (CDKN2A; 600160), MDM2
(164785), TP53, and PTEN (601728) genes. They also analyzed mtDNA
alterations, including D-loop mutations and mtDNA content. No mutation
was found in the TP53 DNA-binding domain. Comparison of p14(ARF) and
PTEN methylation patterns showed significant hypermethylation levels in
tumor tissues, whereas the TP53 tumor suppressor gene was not
hypermethylated. The proportion of PTEN methylation was significantly
higher in serum than in the normal tissues and it had a significant
correlation to tumor tissues. mtDNA analysis revealed 36% somatic and
91% germline mutations in the D-loop region and also significant mtDNA
depletion in tumor tissues. In addition, the mtDNA content in matched
serum was significantly lower than in the normal tissues. Barekati et
al. (2010) concluded that hypermethylation could break down the
p14(ARF)/MDM2/TP53 and PTEN regulatory pathways, resulting in p53
inactivation in breast cancer patients lacking TP53 mutation in the
DNA-binding domain.

- Role in Insulin Resistance

Using a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, Minamino et al. (2009) found
that p53 has a role in regulating insulin resistance. Excessive caloric
intake led to the accumulation of oxidative stress in adipose tissue,
development of insulin resistance, increased expression of p53, and
increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of p53
markedly ameliorated these changes, and conversely, upregulation of p53
in adipose tissue caused an inflammatory response that led to insulin
resistance.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Cho et al. (1994) co-crystallized the core domain of p53 bound to DNA.
They found that the structure of p53 is unique, consisting of a large
beta sandwich that acts as a scaffold for 3 loop-based elements. The
sandwich is composed of 2 anti-parallel beta sheets containing 4 and 5
beta strands, respectively. The first loop binds to DNA within the major
groove, the second loop binds to DNA within the minor groove, and the
third loop packs against the second loop to stabilize it. Vogelstein and
Kinzler (1994) noted that the p53 residues most frequently mutated in
cancers are all at or near the protein-DNA interface, and more than
two-thirds of the missense mutations are in 1 of the 3 DNA loops.

Jeffrey et al. (1995) reported the crystal structure of the p53
tetramerization domain at 1.7-angstrom resolution and described the
physical properties of the tetrameric interaction.

Chuikov et al. (2004) reported the crystal structure of a ternary
complex of SET9 (606594) with a p53 peptide and the cofactor product
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The structure provided the molecular basis
for recognition of p53 by SET9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Reviews

In a review, Frebourg and Friend (1992) presented information on 18
germline mutations of the P53 gene. The mutations were widely
distributed over the P53 gene, resulting in changes between amino acid
residues 72 and 325.

In a review, Levine et al. (1991) noted that there are at least 3
mutation 'hotspots' affecting residues 175, 248, and 273 of p53. The
highest percentage of mutations (13%) had been found at position 273.

Hollstein et al. (1991) reviewed the repertoire of mutations in the
evolutionarily conserved codons of P53 in diverse types of human cancer.
Transitions predominated in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies,
whereas G:C to T:A transversions were the most frequent substitutions
observed in lung and liver cancers. Mutations at A:T basepairs were more
frequent in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most
transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and
lymphomas were at CpG dinucleotide mutation hotspots. G-to-T
transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas were dispersed
among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas
in which both aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are cancer
risk factors, most mutations were at 1 nucleotide pair of codon 249.

In a review, Varley (2003) stated that nearly 250 independent germline
TP53 mutations had been reported, most of which were associated with
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS1; 151623) or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome
(151623). They discussed the spectrum of mutations, methods for mutation
detection, tumors associated with germline mutations, and ethical and
clinical issues related to patients with germline TP53 mutations. They
noted that the most striking association between germline TP53 mutations
and cancer occurred in cases of childhood adrenocortical carcinoma
(ADCC), which was identified as a component tumor of Li-Fraumeni
syndrome from the earliest studies. Varley et al. (1999) had found that
more than 80% of a cohort of children with ADCC unselected for family
history had a germline TP53 mutation. In addition, all 12 LFS or
LFS-like families with a case of ADCC that Varley (2003) studied had a
germline TP53 mutation. They estimated that TP53 mutations are present
in 88% of ADCC cases.

- Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-Like Syndromes

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer syndrome characterized
by autosomal dominant inheritance and early onset of tumors, multiple
tumors within an individual, and multiple affected family members. The
most common types of tumors are soft tissue sarcomas and osteosarcomas,
breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma.
Classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS1; 151623) is defined as a proband with
a sarcoma before the age of 45 years and a first-degree relative with
any cancer before the age of 45 years and 1 additional first- or
second-degree relative in the same lineage with any cancer before the
age of 45 years or a sarcoma at any age (Li et al., 1988).
Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL; 151623) is defined as a proband with any
childhood cancer, or a sarcoma, brain tumor, or adrenocortical tumor
before the age of 45 years, plus a first- or second-degree relative in
the same lineage with a typical LFS tumor at any age, and an additional
first- or second-degree relative in the same lineage with any cancer
before the age of 60 years (Birch et al., 1994). A less restrictive
definition of LFL is 2 different LFS-related tumors in first- or
second-degree relatives at any age (Eeles, 1995). Approximately 70% of
LFS cases and 40% of LFL cases contain germline mutations in the p53
gene (Bachinski et al., 2005).

Malkin et al. (1990) detected germline mutations in the TP53 gene in all
5 families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome analyzed.

Malkin et al. (1992) identified germline mutations in the p53 gene in 3
of 59 children and young adults with a second primary cancer whose
family histories were not indicative of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

Wang et al. (2013) reported on members of families with Li-Fraumeni
syndrome who carried germline mutations in the TP53 gene. As compared
with family members who are not carriers and with healthy volunteers,
family members with these mutations have increased oxidative
phosphorylation of skeletal muscle. Basic experimental studies of tissue
samples from patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome and a mouse model of
the syndrome supported this in vivo finding of increased mitochondrial
function. Wang et al. (2013) concluded that their results suggested that
p53 regulates bioenergetic homeostasis in humans.

- Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Hsu et al. (1991) analyzed p53 for mutations in hepatocellular
carcinomas from patients in Qidong, China, an area of high incidence in
which both hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) are risk factors.
Eight of 16 tumors had a point mutation at the third base position of
codon 249 (191170.0006). The G-to-T transversion in 7 of the DNA samples
and the G-to-C transversion in the eighth were consistent with mutations
caused by aflatoxin B1 in mutagenesis experiments. No mutations were
found in exons 5, 6, 8, or the remainder of exon 7. These results
contrasted with p53 mutations previously reported in carcinomas and
sarcomas of lung, colon, esophagus, and breast; these were scattered
over 4 of the 5 evolutionarily conserved domains, including codon 249.

Studying hepatocellular carcinoma in sub-Saharan Africa, where hepatitis
B virus and aflatoxins are risk factors, Bressac et al. (1991) found
allelic deletions from chromosome 17p and mutations of the P53 gene in
50% of tumors. G-to-T substitutions, with clustering at codon 249, were
found in 4 of 5 mutations. The G-to-T mutation at codon 249 led to a
change from arginine to serine (AGG to AGT). Bressac et al. (1991) also
identified a G-to-T substitution in codon 157 resulting in a change from
valine to phenylalanine (191170.0007). They noted that Foster et al.
(1983) had shown that aflatoxin B1 induces G-to-T substitutions almost
exclusively. (Cigarette smoke appears to induce predominantly C-to-A
mutations, whereas sunlight produces G-to-A mutations, and replication
error results in C-to-T mutations.)

On the basis of their experience, Patel et al. (1992) suggested that the
contrast in the frequency rates of the arg249-to-ser mutation between
areas of high and low aflatoxin exposure was less striking than inferred
by earlier reports. Buetow et al. (1992) arrived at a similar
conclusion.

Aguilar et al. (1993) studied mutagenesis of codons 247 to 250 of p53 by
rat liver microsome-activated AFB1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma
cells of the HepG2 line. AFB1 preferentially induced C-to-T
transversions in the third position of codon 249, but it also induced
G-to-T and C-to-A transversions into adjacent codons, albeit at lower
frequencies. Since the latter mutations are not observed in human
hepatocellular carcinoma, it follows that both mutability on the DNA
level and altered function of the mutant ser249 p53 protein are
responsible for the observed mutation hotspot.

To investigate the role of AFB1 and of the AGG-to-AGT mutation at codon
249 in hepatocarcinogenesis, Aguilar et al. (1994) examined TP53 for
mutations in normal liver samples from the United States, Thailand, and
Qidong, China, where AFB1 exposures are negligible, low, and high,
respectively. The frequency of the arg249-to-ser mutation paralleled the
level of AFB1 exposure, supporting the hypothesis that AFB1 has a
causative and probably early role in hepatocarcinogenesis.

- Osteogenic Sarcoma

Masuda et al. (1987) surveyed 134 human carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias,
and lymphomas obtained at surgery or from peripheral blood and found
rearrangements of the P53 gene only in osteogenic sarcomas (259500). The
change was identified in 3 of 6 osteogenic sarcomas examined. Normal
tissue from 1 of these patients had an unrearranged gene, indicating
that the genetic abnormality in the tumor was acquired. Two of the
sarcomas with rearranged genes expressed levels of p53 protein that were
elevated relative to other tumors. Alterations of the P53 gene were also
found in 3 human osteogenic sarcoma cell lines.

Romano et al. (1989) reported a G-to-C mutation in codon 156 of the
human P53 gene, resulting in an arg-to-pro substitution, in an
osteosarcoma cell line.

In osteosarcomas, Mulligan et al. (1990) detected homozygous deletion
and lack of expression of p53 RNA or aberrant expression of p53 protein.
Since other, primary mutations had been defined in these tumors, they
suggested that the change in p53 played a progressional role in
tumorigenesis. In 26 retinoblastoma tumors, no change in the P53 gene
was found, despite the frequency with which such alterations were found
in the clinically associated tumor, osteosarcoma. Mulligan et al. (1990)
concluded that retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma may have common
requirements for an initiating mutation, whereas different progressional
mutations, isochromosome 6p in retinoblastoma, are involved in
progression.

Using SSCP analysis, Iavarone et al. (1992) identified p53 point
mutations in tumor DNA from 4 patients with multifocal osteogenic
sarcoma without familial histories of increased tumor predisposition. A
germline p53 mutation was detected in 1 of the patients, whose tumor
tissue showed a further rearrangement of the residual wildtype allele.

Toguchida et al. (1992) identified a germline p53 mutation in 8 of 15
patients selected from a total of 196 patients with sarcoma because they
had had multiple primary cancers or had a family history of cancer.
Three of the patients had no known family history of cancer, and the
other 5 had an unusual personal or family history of cancer. The tumor
was osteosarcoma in 7 of the 8 patients and malignant fibrous
histiocytoma in the eighth. Four mutations caused amino acid
substitutions, and 4 caused stop codons. The authors concluded that the
group of patients with cancer and germline p53 mutations appears to be
more diverse than suggested by the clinical definition of Li-Fraumeni
syndrome.

Smith-Sorensen et al. (1993) noted that osteosarcoma frequently occurs
in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and in transgenic mice carrying a
mutant p53 allele (Lavigueur et al., 1989). Having previously used
constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE) followed by direct
sequencing to identify mutations in conserved domains II to V of TP53,
Smith-Sorensen et al. (1993) reported conditions for screening more of
the codons in the frequently mutated region of exons 5 to 8 of TP53 and
for detecting mutations in sequences encoding functional domains in the
N- and C-terminal parts of the p53 protein. Of 28 osteosarcomas
examined, 6 had a TP53 mutation, 2 of which had previously been
identified in osteosarcomas: ser241-to-phe (191170.0013) and
arg282-to-trp (191170.0018).

- Rhabdomyosarcoma

Mulligan et al. (1990) studied 241 patients with various neoplasms and
found changes in p53 in 31 and 29 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma and
osteosarcoma, respectively. The p53 alterations in rhabdomyosarcomas
included complete deletion of both p53 alleles, complete deletion of 1
allele with or without point mutation of the remaining allele, and
absence of detectable RNA.

- Colorectal Cancer

Baker et al. (1989) concluded that TP53 mutations may be involved in
colorectal cancer (114500), perhaps through inactivation of a tumor
suppressor function of the wildtype gene. Monpezat et al. (1988) found
loss of alleles on chromosomes 17 and 18 in polyploid colorectal
carcinomas.

By immunohistologic staining of primary colorectal carcinomas with
antibodies specific for p53, Rodrigues et al. (1990) demonstrated gross
overexpression of the protein in 50% of cases. Benign adenomas were all
negative for p53 overexpression. By direct sequencing and
chemical-mismatch-cleavage analysis of p53 cDNA using PCR in 6 cell
lines expressing high levels of p53, they showed that all were
synthesizing mRNAs encoding mutant p53 proteins. In 2 of 4 cell lines in
which p53 expression was lower, point mutations were still detected. An
arg273-to-his mutation was found in 4 of the 7 instances in which
specific point mutations were identified.

The histopathologic features of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine
and colorectal cancer are similar, and patients with one cancer are
considered at risk for developing the other (Neugut and Santos, 1993).
Wheeler et al. (2002) examined the possible contribution of TP53 to
sporadic small intestinal adenocarcinoma. TP53 protein expression was
assessed immunohistochemically in 21 nonfamilial, nonampullary small
intestinal adenocarcinomas, and overexpression was demonstrated in 5
(24%). Arai et al. (1997) had previously demonstrated TP53
overexpression in 8 (53.3%) of 15 small intestinal adenocarcinomas and
found missense mutations in 4 of these. This and similar studies led
Wheeler et al. (2002) to suggest that TP53 mutation plays an important
role in pathogenesis of small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

Liu and Bodmer (2006) analyzed the TP53 gene and its protein status in
56 colorectal cancer cell lines and detected 46 mutations in 43 of the
cell lines, of which almost half were truncating mutations. The
frequency of TP53 mutations (76.8%) in this study was higher than the
usually reported average of 50%. Protein product was detectable in 32
(74%) of 43 mutant cell lines. Although only 4 cell lines made no TP53
transcript, no protein was detected in 6 cell lines with truncating
mutations and also in 1 cell line with a missense mutation. Liu and
Bodmer (2006) suggested that truncating mutations may have
dominant-negative effects, even when no truncated protein can be
detected by standard methods.

McMurray et al. (2008) showed that a large proportion of genes
controlled synergistically by loss-of-function p53 and Ras activation
are critical to the malignant state of murine and human colon cells.
Notably, 14 of 24 'cooperation response genes' were found to contribute
to tumor formation in gene perturbation experiments. In contrast, only 1
of 14 perturbations of the genes responding in a nonsynergistic manner
had a similar effect. McMurray et al. (2008) concluded that synergistic
control of gene expression by oncogenic mutations thus emerges as an
underlying key to malignancy, and provides an attractive rationale for
identifying intervention targets in gene networks downstream of
oncogenic gain- and loss-of-function mutations.

- Lung Cancer

Since lung cancer frequently shows loss of heterozygosity on 17p,
Takahashi et al. (1989) examined the p53 gene and found that it was
frequently mutated or inactivated in all types of human lung cancer. The
genetic abnormalities included gross changes, such as homozygous
deletions and abnormally sized mRNAs, along with a variety of point or
small mutations that changed amino acids in a region highly conserved
between man and mouse. Low or absent expression of p53 mRNA in lung
cancer cell lines compared with normal lung was observed. In all of 10
small cell lung cancer cell lines and 9 non-SCLC cell lines, Takahashi
et al. (1989) found coexistence of 3 abnormalities involving chromosome
3p, RB (614041) on chromosome 13, and p53.

Iggo et al. (1990) suggested that P53 is the protooncogene most commonly
mutated in lung cancer. They identified several G-to-T transversions
that resulted in missense changes in evolutionarily conserved amino
acids.

Chiba et al. (1990) identified p53 mutations in 23 (45%) of 51 early
stage, primary, resected non-small cell lung cancer specimens, but not
in corresponding normal lung. G-to-T transversions were a common result
of p53 mutations in lung cancer compared with other cancers, suggesting
exposure to different mutagens. In univariate and multivariate analysis,
p53 mutations were associated with younger age and squamous histology.
However, p53 mutations were not significantly associated with tumor
stage, nodal status, or sex and were found in all histologic types of
lung cancer.

Takahashi et al. (1990) identified intronic point mutations as a
mechanism for inactivation of the tumor suppressor function of P53 in
lung cancer. They identified point mutations at the splice acceptor site
in the third intron and in the splice donor site in the seventh intron
accounting for abnormal mRNA splicing. In 1 patient, the same intronic
point mutation was found in the tumor cell line derived from a bone
marrow metastasis and in multiple liver metastases, but not in normal
DNA.

Roth et al. (1996) investigated the effects of injecting a retroviral
vector containing wildtype p53 under control of a beta-actin promoter
into non-small cell lung carcinomas. Following injection, tumor
regression occurred in 3 patients, and tumor growth stabilized in 3
other patients.

Individuals with 1 malignancy of the aerodigestive tract have a high
incidence of second primary aerodigestive tumors. Franklin et al. (1997)
studied an individual with widespread dysplastic changes in the
respiratory epithelium but no overt carcinoma. The patient was a
66-year-old man with a 50-pack-per-year history of smoking and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. His sputum cytology had shown moderate
atypia. He died unexpectedly after laparotomy for small bowel
obstruction. The tracheobronchial tree was obtained at autopsy and
embedded in paraffin, and bronchial epithelial cells were isolated by
microdissection. A single, identical point mutation in the p53 gene, a
transversion of G:C to T:A in codon 245, was identified in bronchial
epithelium from 7 of 10 sites in both lungs. Epithelium at sites
containing the p53 mutation was morphologically abnormal, exhibiting
squamous metaplasia and mild-to-moderate atypia. No invasive tumor was
found in the tracheobronchial tree or any other location, and cells from
the peripheral blood, kidney, liver, and lymph node exhibited no
abnormality in the p53 gene. Franklin et al. (1997) hypothesized that a
single progenitor bronchial epithelial clone may expand to populate
broad areas of the bronchial mucosa, a novel mechanism for field
carcinogenesis in the respiratory epithelium.

- Head and Neck Cancer

Hollstein et al. (1990) studied 4 human esophageal carcinoma cell lines
and 14 human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and identified a
mutated p53 allele (1 frameshift and 6 missense mutations) in 2 cell
lines and in 5 of the tumor specimens. All missense mutations occurred
at G:C basepairs in codons at or adjacent to mutations previously
reported in other cancers.

Chakrani et al. (1995) studied 41 primary tumors of the undifferentiated
nasopharyngeal cancer type from Hong Kong and the Guangxi province of
southeastern China. Four point mutations were found clustered in exon 5
from codon 175 to 177.

Brennan et al. (1995) presented results pointing to the molecular target
of tobacco and alcohol, which epidemiologic studies show are associated
with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. They found P53
mutations in 42% of patients (54 of 129); in 58% of patients who smoked
cigarettes and used alcohol (37 of 64); in 33% of patients who smoked
but abstained from alcohol (13 of 39); and in 17% of patients who
neither smoked nor drank alcohol (4 of 24). All mutations in patients
who neither drank nor smoked occurred at sites containing CpG
dinucleotides (potentially representing endogenous mutations) within the
P53 gene, whereas only 23% of those in cigarette smokers consisted of
such changes.

Poeta et al. (2007) found TP53 mutations in tumors from 224 (53.3%) of
420 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Compared
with wildtype TP53, the presence of any TP53 mutation was associated
with decreased overall survival, with an even stronger association with
disruptive mutations and no significant association with nondisruptive
mutations. Poeta et al. (2007) defined disruptive mutations as
nonconservative mutations inside the key DNA-binding domain (L2-L3
region), or stop codons in any region, and nondisruptive mutations as
conservative or nonconservative mutations outside the L2-L3 region,
excluding stop codons.

- Brain Tumors

Chung et al. (1990) found that human glioblastomas (see GLM1, 137800)
with P53 mutations had an earlier age of onset than did tumors without
P53 mutations. The average postoperative survival among patients with
P53 mutations was considerably longer than that of the group without
such mutations.

In a family in which many members had died of cancers of various types,
consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Metzger et al. (1991) identified a
patient with a malignant ependymoma of the posterior fossa who had a
cys242-to-tyr mutation (C242Y; 191170.0008) of the P53 gene in both the
germline and the tumor.

Schiffer et al. (1995) used SSCP analysis of exons 5 to 8 and direct
sequence analysis to search for p53 mutations in 30 cases of childhood
astrocytic tumors. Somatic mutations were found in 2 of 8 glioblastomas
and in 1 of 9 anaplastic astrocytomas, but in none were found in the
more benign pilocytic astrocytomas.

- Bladder Cancer

Sidransky et al. (1991) identified alterations of p53 in 11 of 18
invasive bladder cancers (109800). Point mutations resulting in single
amino acid substitutions were present in 10, and a 24-bp deletion was
found in 1. In all but 1, the mutations were associated with 17p allelic
deletions, leaving the cells with only mutant forms of the p53 gene
product. Using PCR and oligomer-specific hybridization, p53 mutations
were identified in 1 to 7% of cells in urine sediment from each of 3
patients tested.

- Skin Cancer

In a series of New England and Swedish patients, Brash et al. (1991)
found that 14 (58%) of 24 invasive squamous cell carcinomas of skin
contained mutations in the P53 gene, each altering the amino acid
sequence. Involvement of UV light in these mutations was indicated by
the presence in 3 tumors of a CC-to-TT change, which is only induced by
UV. UV was also implicated by a UV-like occurrence of mutations
exclusively at dipyrimidine sites, including a high frequency of C-to-T
substitutions. In internal malignancies, p53 mutations do not show these
UV-specific mutations.

Dumaz et al. (1993) used RT-PCR and SSCP to analyze more than 40 skin
tumors, mainly basal and squamous cell carcinomas, from patients with
xeroderma pigmentosum (see 278700). They found that 17 of 43 contained
at least 1 point mutation in the TP53 gene. All mutations were located
at dipyrimidine sites, essentially at CC sequences, which are hotspots
for UV-induced DNA lesions. In 14 of 19 mutations at CC sites, a tandem
CC-to-TT transition, unique to UV-induced lesions, was found. The
mutations were considered to be due to translesion synthesis of
unrepaired dipyrimidine lesions left on the untranscribed strand.

Ziegler et al. (1994) pointed out that squamous cell carcinoma of the
skin can progress by stages: sun-damaged epidermis, with individual
disordered keratinocytes; actinic keratosis, spontaneously regressing
keratinized patches having aberrant cell differentiation and
proliferation; carcinoma in situ; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin;
and metastasis. They showed that p53 mutations induced by UV radiation
and found in more than 90% of human squamous cell carcinomas were
present in actinic keratoses. Inactivating p53 in mouse skin reduced the
appearance of sunburn cells (apoptotic keratinocytes generated by
overexposure to UV radiation). Ziegler et al. (1994) concluded that skin
possesses a p53-dependent 'guardian-of-the-tissue' response to DNA
damage that aborts precancerous cells. If this response is reduced in a
single cell by a prior p53 mutation, sunburn can select for clonal
expansion of the p53-mutated cell into an actinic keratosis. Thus,
sunlight can act twice: as tumor initiator and tumor promoter.

DNA-damaged cells can either repair the DNA or be eliminated through a
homeostatic control mechanism mediated by p53 termed 'cellular
proofreading.' Elimination of DNA-damaged cells after UV radiation
through sunburn cell (or apoptotic keratinocyte) formation is thought to
be pivotal for removal of precancerous skin cells. Hill et al. (1999)
demonstrated that sunburn cell formation depended upon Fas ligand (FASL;
134638), a proapoptotic protein induced by DNA damage. Chronic exposure
to UV radiation caused 14 (70%) of 20 FasL-deficient mice and 1 (5%) of
20 wildtype mice to accumulate p53 mutations in the epidermis. Hill et
al. (1999) concluded that FASL-mediated apoptosis is important for skin
homeostasis, suggesting that dysregulation of FAS-FASL interactions may
be central to development of skin cancer.

- Cervical and Anal Cancer

Development of cervical and anal cancers has been linked with infection
by human papillomaviruses (HPVs), most commonly HPV16 or HPV18 (167960).
The virally encoded oncoproteins E6 and E7 form complexes with
cell-encoded p53 and RB, respectively, likely resulting in loss of the
negative growth control normally exerted by p53 and RB (614041). E6 can
direct rapid proteolytic degradation of p53, and E6 expression following
HPV infection is likely to be a loss of functional wildtype p53 protein
within the cell. Crook et al. (1992) found that HPV-negative cervical
cancers had point mutations in the TP53 gene. They also showed that loss
of wildtype p53 function was critical in the pathology of anogenital
cancer and that, in the absence of a virally encoded E6 protein
mediating p53 degradation, this loss of function occurred via somatic
mutation. Prognosis of HPV-negative cervical cancers was found to be
worse than that of HPV-positive cancers. Kaelbling et al. (1992)
likewise found loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p and mutant p53
in HPV-negative cervical carcinomas.

- Breast Cancer

Borresen et al. (1991) devised a modification of denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE), termed 'constant denaturant gel electrophoresis'
(CDGE), and used it to screen the 4 conserved regions of the P53 gene
where most mutations had been found. CDGE detected P53 mutations in 11
of 32 breast carcinomas (114480).

Using a monoclonal antibody, Moll et al. (1992) demonstrated that 10
(37%) of 27 breast cancers showed a pattern of staining indicating that
the p53 protein was limited to the cytoplasm and absent from the
nucleus. In 8 cases (30%), the nuclei of cancer cells showed high levels
of P53, and in 9 cases (33%) there was complete lack of staining.
Sequencing of P53 cDNAs from the samples with cytoplasmic staining
revealed only wildtype p53 alleles in 6 of 7 cases. An eighth case was
determined to be wildtype by SSCP. In contrast, the samples containing
nuclear p53 contained a variety of missense mutations and a nonsense
mutation. Tumors that lacked detectable p53 staining had wildtype
nucleotide sequences. A case of normal lactating breast tissue also
showed intense cytoplasmic staining with nuclear sparing. Moll et al.
(1992) concluded that some breast cancers inactivate the
tumor-suppressing activity of p53 by sequestering the protein in the
cytoplasm, away from its site of action in the nucleus. Detection of
cytoplasmic p53 in normal lactating breast tissue suggested that this
mechanism may be employed in specific physiologic situations to permit
transient cell proliferation. Moll et al. (1992) referred to the
phenomenon as nuclear exclusion.

Borresen et al. (1992) reported a germline arg181-to-his (R181H)
mutation in the TP53 gene in a case of familial breast cancer. However,
one sister with breast and colon cancer had not inherited the mutation,
and another with breast cancer and Hodgkin disease had inherited the
mutation, but the mutant allele was lost somatically in the breast
tumor, suggesting that the mutation at codon 181 was not responsible for
the cancer. On transfection of the mutant TP53 into malignant cells,
Frebourg et al. (1992) found that it behaved like wildtype TP53.
Frebourg et al. (1992) emphasized the importance of genetic or biologic
analysis of germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes as a
prerequisite to counseling about cancer risks.

Patocs et al. (2007) hypothesized that mutational inactivation of TP53
and genomic alterations in stromal cells of a tumor's microenvironment
contribute to clinical outcome. They performed TP53 mutation analysis
and genomewide analysis of loss of heterozygosity and allelic imbalance
on DNA from isolated neoplastic epithelial and stromal cells from 43
patients with hereditary breast cancer due to BRCA1 (113705) or BRCA2
(600185) mutations and 175 patients with sporadic breast cancer. TP53
mutations were associated with an increased loss of heterozygosity and
allelic imbalance in both hereditary and sporadic breast cancers, but
samples from patients with hereditary disease had more frequent
mutations than did those from patients with sporadic tumors. Only 1
microsatellite locus in stromal cells from hereditary breast cancers was
associated with mutated TP53, whereas there were 66 such loci in cells
from sporadic breast cancers. Somatic TP53 mutations in stroma, but not
epithelium, of sporadic breast cancers were associated with regional
nodal metastases (P of 0.003). A specific set of 5 loci linked to an
increased loss of heterozygosity and allelic imbalance in the stroma of
sporadic tumors was associated with nodal metastases in the absence of
TP53 mutations. In hereditary breast cancer, no associations were found
between any of the clinical or pathologic features and somatic TP53
mutations. Several authors disputed the findings of Patocs et al. (2007)
based on their own studies (Campbell et al., 2008), comparison with
known p53 mutation databases (Zander and Soussi, 2008 and Zalcman et
al., 2008), or selection of the patient population (Roukos, 2008).

- Leukemia and Lymphoma

Felix et al. (1992) used SSCP analysis to study the P53 gene in 10
families with multiple members affected with leukemia. The diagnoses
included acute and chronic leukemias and Hodgkin disease. Felix et al.
(1992) concluded that p53 mutations are not a primary event responsible
for hereditary susceptibility to familial leukemia.

Felix et al. (1992) examined the p53 gene in primary lymphoblasts of 25
pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using the
RNase protection assay and SSCP analysis. In 4 of 25, p53 mutations were
found. In 1 pedigree consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a germline
G-to-T transversion at codon 272 (valine to leucine) was found. The
proband died at age 19 years of ALL.

Although malignant lymphomas had been described as part of the spectrum
of neoplasias in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Potzsch et al. (1999) found no
constitutional p53 mutations in 12 lymphoma patients with a family
history of lymphoma and/or metachronous lymphoma. The results implied
that outside the clinical spectrum of LFS, constitutional p53 mutations
are rare in patients with lymphomas.

- Rheumatoid Arthritis

Firestein et al. (1997) proposed that genetic changes caused by local
oxidative damage is a mechanism that permanently alters or imprints
synovial cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300). In contrast,
mutations in TP53 had not been observed in osteoarthritis synovial
samples. Using microdissected RA synovial tissue sections, Yamanishi et
al. (2002) observed abundant TP53 transition mutations characteristic of
DNA damage caused by oxidative stress. TP53 mutations, as well as TP53
mRNA expression, were located mainly in the synovial intimal lining
rather than the sublining (P less than 0.01). Clusters of TP53 mutant
subclones were observed in some microdissected regions, suggesting
oligoclonal expansion. Because expression of the IL6 gene (147620) is
regulated by wildtype p53, Yamanishi et al. (2002) quantified IL6 mRNA
expression in microdissected tissues. The regions with high rates of
TP53 mutations contained significantly greater amounts of IL6 mRNA
compared with the low mutation samples (P less than 0.02). Yamanishi et
al. (2002) concluded that TP53 mutations are induced in RA synovial
tissues by inflammatory oxidative stress. This process, as in
sun-exposed skin and inflamed colonic epithelium, provides some of the
mutant clones with a selective growth advantage. A relatively low
percentage of cells containing TP53 mutations can potentially affect
neighboring cells and enhance inflammation through elaboration of
proinflammatory cytokines.

- Polymorphisms

Ara et al. (1990) reported a pro72-to-arg (P72R; 191170.0005)
polymorphism in p53. Dumont et al. (2003) found that R72 had up to
15-fold increased apoptotic ability compared with P72 in both inducible
cell lines and cells with endogenous p53 homozygous for each variant.
For further information on the P72R polymorphism, see 191170.0005.

Wildtype p53 has a proline at codon 47 (P47) that acts as a recognition
site for phosphorylation of ser46 by p38 MAPK (MAPK14; 600289), which
enhances induction of apoptosis. However, fewer than 5% of African
Americans have a serine at codon 47 (S47) due to a C-to-T SNP. Li et al.
(2005) showed that the S47 variant of p53 was a poorer substrate for
phosphorylation by p38 MAPK, resulting in up to 5-fold reduced ability
to induce apoptosis compared with wildtype p53. This decreased ability
to induce apoptosis was accompanied by decreased ability to
transactivate p53AIP1 (605246) and PUMA (BBC3; 605854), but not other
p53 target genes, in transfected human cells.

- Drug and Chemotherapy Resistance

Aas et al. (1996) presented data linking specific mutations in the P53
gene to primary resistance to doxorubicin therapy and early relapse in
breast cancer patients. The L2 domain (codons 163 to 195) and the L3
domain (codons 236 of 256) contain zinc finger sequences and are
involved in p53 DNA-binding function. Of 63 patients studied, 11 had
mutations affecting L2 and/or L3. Four of the 11 patients with mutations
affecting L2/L3 became progressively worse during doxorubicin treatment
versus 2 of 52 patients without mutations or with mutations not
affecting the L2/L3 domain. P53 mutations in patients with progressive
disease all affected the L3 domain. Of 8 patients with L3 mutations, 4
expressed primary resistance to anthracycline therapy. Aas et al. (1996)
reported that patients with P53 mutations affecting the zinc-binding
domain who responded to primary chemotherapy initially in most cases had
a relapse of disease within 3 months.

Yu et al. (2002) reported that mice bearing tumors derived from p53 -/-
HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells were less responsive to
antiangiogenic combination therapy than mice bearing tumors derived from
p53 +/+ HCT116 cells. They concluded that genetic alterations that
decrease the vascular dependence of tumor cells can influence the
response of tumors to antiangiogenic therapy.

p53 and INK4A/ARF (600160) mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug
resistance in part by disabling apoptosis. Schmitt et al. (2002) showed
that primary murine lymphomas responded to chemotherapy by engaging a
senescence program controlled by p53 and p16(Ink4a). Hence, tumors with
p53 or Ink4a/Arf mutations, but not those lacking Arf alone, responded
poorly to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo. Moreover, tumors harboring a
Bcl2 (151430)-mediated apoptotic block underwent a drug-induced
cytostasis involving accumulation of p53, p16(Ink4a), and senescence
markers, and they typically acquired p53 or Ink4a mutations upon
progression to a terminal stage. Mice bearing tumors capable of
drug-induced senescence had a much better prognosis following
chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects.
Schmitt et al. (2002) concluded that cellular senescence contributes to
treatment outcome in vivo.

- Mechanisms of Somatic Mutations

The role of cytosine methylation in CpG dinucleotides in germline
mutations that cause mendelian disorders was pointed out by Cooper and
Youssoufian (1988). Rideout et al. (1990) emphasized the contribution of
5-methylcytosine to somatic mutations resulting in human disease,
particularly tumorigenesis. They suggested that as much as 43% of P53
somatic mutations (9 of 21 observed mutations in tumors) may be due to
the presence of 5-methylcytosine. Rideout et al. (1990) noted that CpGs
make up 3.5% of the P53 double-stranded coding sequence and may be
contributing to as much as 43% of the point mutations, each of which is
a transition from 5-methylcytosine to thymine (or a corresponding
transition from guanine to adenine).

Krawczak et al. (1995) compared the spectrum of somatic TP53 single
basepair substitutions detected in 955 cancers with that of 2,224
different germline mutations in 279 different human genes (other than
TP53), reported as the cause of inherited disease. The comparison
demonstrated that, disregarding a relatively small subset (12%) of TP53
mutations that probably resulted from the action of exogenous mutagens,
both the relative rates and the nearest-neighbor spectra of single
basepair substitutions were similar in the 2 datasets. This resemblance
suggested that a substantial proportion of cancer-associated somatic
TP53 mutations result from endogenous cellular mechanisms. The
likelihood of clinical observation of a particular mutation type
differs, however, between tumors and genetic diseases, when the chemical
properties of the resulting amino acid substitutions are considered.
Together with a 6-fold higher observation likelihood for mutations at
evolutionarily conserved residues, this finding argues that selection is
a critical factor in determining which TP53 mutations are found to be
associated with human cancer.

Since cigarette smoke carcinogens such as benzo(a)pyrene are implicated
in development of lung cancer, Denissenko et al. (1996) investigated the
relationship between benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) adduct formation
and P53 mutations. (BPDE is the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of
benzo(a)pyrene.) HeLa cells and normal bronchial epithelial cells were
treated with BPDE, and DNA was isolated and cleaved at the sites of
modified bases with UvrABC nuclease complex from E. coli. They mapped
the distribution of BPDE adducts along the P53 gene using a modification
of ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) with P53 oligonucleotide primers. They
also examined isolated genomic DNA. Denissenko et al. (1996)
demonstrated strong and selective adduct formation at guanine positions
in codons 157, 248, and 273. They noted that these positions are the
major mutation hotspots in human lung cancers and stated that the
coincidence of mutational hotspots and adduct hotspots suggests that
benzo(a)pyrene metabolites or structurally related compounds are
involved in transformation of human lung tissue.

To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the selectivity of BPDE
binding, Denissenko et al. (1997) mapped the adducts in plasmid DNA
containing genomic P53 sequences. They found that when cytosines in CpG
sequences were converted to 5-methylcytosines by the CpG-specific
methylase, SssI, and the DNA was subsequently treated with BPDE, adduct
hotspots were created that were similar to those seen in genomic DNA
when all CpGs were methylated. A strong positive effect of
5-methylcytosine on BPDE adduct formation at CpG sites was also
documented with sequences of the PGK1 gene (311800) derived from an
active or inactive human X chromosome and having differential
methylation patterns. These results showed that methylated CpG
dinucleotides, in addition to being an endogenous promutagenic factor,
may represent a preferential target for exogenous chemical carcinogens.

Hemochromatosis (HFE; 235200) and Wilson disease (WND; 277900),
characterized by excess hepatic deposition of iron and copper,
respectively, produce oxidative stress and increase the risk of liver
cancer. Hussain et al. (2000) studied nontumorous liver tissue from WND
and HFE patients for the frequency of p53 mutated alleles. When compared
with the liver samples from normal controls, higher frequencies of G:C
to T:A transversions at codon 249 (see 191170.0006), and C:G to A:T
transversions and C:G to T:A transitions at codon 250 were found in
liver tissue from WND cases, and a higher frequency of G:C to T:A
transversions at codon 249 was also found in liver tissue from
hemochromatosis cases. These results were consistent with the hypothesis
that the generation of oxygen/nitrogen species and unsaturated aldehydes
from iron and copper overload in hemochromatosis and WND causes mutation
in the p53 gene.

- Mutation Detection

Tonisson et al. (2002) described an arrayed primer extension-based TP53
gene test as an accurate and efficient tool for DNA sequence analysis
for both research and clinical applications.

- Mutation Databases

Hollstein et al. (1996) gave an update on a listing of point mutations
in the p53 gene of human tumors and cell lines compiled from the
literature and made available electronically through the file server at
the EMBL Data Library. In July 1995, the database contained records on
almost 4,500 mutations. In their Figure 1, they mapped the growth of
mutations in the database since 1989. The data were made available from
the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) network server.

Beroud et al. (1996) described software and a database for p53 gene
mutations available for both MS-DOS and Macintosh platforms. Their
database contained more than 4,200 mutations as of September 1995.

De Vries et al. (1996) described a database of p53 mutations.

Hainaut et al. (1997) reported on the p53 mutation database maintained
at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon,
France, reported on earlier by Hollstein et al. (1996). The current
version contained records on 5,091 published mutations and was expected
to surpass the 6,000 mark in the January 1997 release.

Hernandez-Boussard et al. (1999) stated that the IARC database included
p53 somatic mutations (more than 10,000 entries), p53 germline mutations
(144 entries), and p53 polymorphisms (13 entries), with somatic
mutations organized into a relational database. Included in the database
were annotations on individual characteristics and oncogenic exposures
and a classification of pathologies based on the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). In addition, several
interfaces had been developed to analyze the data in order to produce
mutation spectra, codon analyses, or visualization of the mutation with
the tertiary structure of the protein.

Olivier et al. (2002) provided an update on the IARC TP53 database. More
detailed annotations on patients, including carcinogen exposure, virus
infection, and genetic background, had been added.

Beroud and Soussi (2003) described development of the UMD-p53 database
maintained in Montpellier, France. Soussi et al. (2005) stated that more
than 1,500 different TP53 mutants had been described in this database.
The frequency of mutants was highly heterogeneous, with 11 hotspot
mutants found more than 100 times, and 306 mutants found only once.
Soussi et al. (2005) demonstrated high diversity in terms of loss of
transactivation activity by testing TP53 mutants representing all
possible amino acid substitutions caused by a point mutation. While the
most frequent TP53 mutants sustained a clear loss of transactivation
activity, more than 50% of rare TP53 mutants displayed significant
activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Donehower et al. (1992) found that development was normal in mice
lacking 1 or both p53 alleles, but spontaneous tumors, specifically
lymphomas and sarcomas, occurred in high frequency.

Kemp et al. (1994) reported that a single dose of 4 Gy radiation
dramatically decreased the latency for tumor development in p53
heterozygous mice. The pattern of genetic alterations at the remaining
wildtype allele in these tumors differed substantially from that in
spontaneous tumors from similar mice, indicating that p53 itself may
have been a target for radiation-induced alterations. Radiation at a
lower dose, 1 Gy, of preweanling p53-null mice also significantly
decreased tumor latency, suggesting that additional genetic targets are
involved in radiation-induced malignancy.

Mutations in the p53 gene are found in only 25 to 33% of hepatocellular
carcinoma cases, and the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma cases are
associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. Ueda et al.
(1995) developed a transgenic mouse model in which expression of a
single HBV gene product, the HBx transcriptional transactivator protein,
led to progressive neoplastic changes in liver. Tumor development
correlated precisely with p53 binding to HBx in the cytoplasm and
complete blockage of p53 entry into the nucleus. Analysis of tumor DNA
revealed p53 mutations in only a small proportion of advanced tumors,
suggesting that p53 mutations were not the cause of tumors but may have
contributed to tumor progression. Transgenic mice lacking the p53 gene
were indistinguishable from wildtype litter mates except for early onset
of tumor formation.

Sah et al. (1995) found that a variable percentage of p53-deficient
animals exhibited midbrain exencephaly, a neural tube defect
incompatible with postnatal survival.

DNA damage is thought to initiate the teratogenicity caused by numerous
drugs and environmental chemicals, collectively termed xenobiotics.
Nicol et al. (1995) hypothesized that p53 deficiencies may enhance
susceptibility to chemical teratogenesis. To test this hypothesis, they
chose benzo[a]pyrene, a known teratogen, and tested its effects on
pregnant heterozygous p53-deficient mice. Such mice exhibited between 2-
and 4-fold higher embryo toxicity and teratogenicity than normal p53
controls. Fetal resorptions reflecting in utero death increased 2.6- and
3.6-fold with heterozygous and homozygous p53-deficient embryos,
respectively. Nicol et al. (1995) concluded that p53 is an important
teratologic suppressor gene that protects the embryo from DNA-damaging
chemicals and developmental oxidative stress.

Nakamura et al. (1995) generated transgenic mice expressing wildtype
human p53 in lens, a tissue entirely composed of epithelial cells that
differentiate into elongated fiber cells. These mice developed
microphthalmia due to a defect in fiber formation that occurred shortly
after birth. Apoptotic cells were observed that failed to undergo proper
differentiation. The normal lens phenotype was restored in
double-transgenic mice carrying both wildtype human p53 and a mutant
human p53 lacking wildtype function. Nakamura et al. (1995) concluded
that normal tissue differentiation requires proper balance of p53
expression.

XRCC4 (194363) is involved in DNA double-strand break repair and in
V(D)J recombination. Xrcc4 -/- mice die late in embryonic development
with extensive neuronal apoptosis and arrested lymphocyte development.
Gao et al. (2000) generated mice lacking both Xrcc4 and p53 and found
that p53 deficiency rescued several aspects of Xrcc4 deficiency,
including embryonic lethality, neuronal apoptosis, and impaired cellular
proliferation. However, p53 deficiency did not rescue impaired V(D)J
recombination or lymphocyte development. Mice lacking both Xrcc4 and p53
appeared healthy until postnatal week 6, but then most succumbed to
pro-B-cell lymphomas with chromosomal translocations linking amplified
Myc oncogene (190080) and IgH locus (see 147100) sequences. Gao et al.
(2000) concluded that the increased neuronal apoptosis and cellular
proliferation defects of Xrcc4 -/- mice result from a p53-dependent
response to unrepaired DNA damage.

Marino et al. (2000) generated a mouse model for medulloblastoma
(155255) by conditional inactivation of Rb and p53 in cerebellar
external granular layer (EGL) cells. Inactivation of Rb in a p53-null
background produced mice that developed highly aggressive embryonal
tumors of cerebellum with typical features of medulloblastoma. These
tumors were identified as early as 7 weeks of age on the outer surface
of the molecular layer, corresponding to the location of EGL cells
during development.

Aged humans sustain a high rate of epithelial cancers, whereas mice with
common tumor suppressor gene mutations typically develop soft tissue
sarcomas and lymphomas. Artandi et al. (2000) found that telomere
attrition in aging telomerase (TERC; 602322)-deficient p53 mutant mice
promoted development of epithelial cancers by a process of fusion-bridge
breakage that led to formation of complex nonreciprocal translocations,
a classic cytogenetic feature of human carcinomas.

Jimenez et al. (2000) generated mice with an allele of the Trp53 gene
encoding changes at leu25 and trp26, residues essential for
transcriptional transactivation and binding with Mdm2 (164785). Mutant
Trp53 was abundantly expressed, its level was not affected by DNA
damage, and it bound DNA constitutively; however, it showed defects in
cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Both mutant and Trp53-null mouse
embryonic fibroblasts were readily transformed by oncogenes, and the
corresponding mice were prone to tumors. Jimenez et al. (2000) concluded
that Trp53-mediated tumor suppression in mice requires the Trp53
transactivation domain.

Reilly et al. (2000) described a mouse model of astrocytoma involving
mutation of Nf1 (613113) and Trp53. Humans with neurofibromatosis-1 due
to mutations in the NF1 gene have an increased risk of optic gliomas,
astrocytomas, and glioblastomas. TP53 is often mutated in a subset of
astrocytomas that develop at a young age and progress slowly to
secondary glioblastomas. The mouse model developed by Reilly et al.
(2000) showed a range of astrocytoma stages, from low-grade astrocytoma
to glioblastoma multiforme, and they suggested that it may accurately
model human secondary glioblastoma involving TP53 loss.

Jonkers et al. (2001) developed conditional mutants for Brca2 (600185)
and/or p53 inactivated in various epithelial tissues, including mammary
gland epithelium. Although no tumors arose in mice carrying conditional
Brca2 alleles, mammary and skin tumors developed frequently in females
carrying conditional Brca2 and Trp53 alleles. The presence of 1 wildtype
Brca2 allele resulted in a markedly delayed tumor formation; loss of the
wildtype Brca2 allele occurred in a subset of these tumors. Jonkers et
al. (2001) concluded that inactivation of BRCA2 and of p53 combine to
mediate mammary tumorigenesis and that disruption of the p53 pathway is
pivotal in BRCA2-associated breast cancer.

Tyner et al. (2002) inadvertently generated mice with a deletion of the
first 6 exons of p53, resulting in expression of a truncated RNA capable
of encoding a C-terminal p53 fragment. They termed the defective p53
allele the 'm' allele. Tyner et al. (2002) could not identify any p53 m
protein, but the mutant allele conferred phenotypes consistent with
activated rather than inactivated p53. Mutant (p53 +/m) mice exhibited
enhanced resistance to spontaneous tumors compared with wildtype
littermates, and they displayed early aging phenotypes. A second line of
transgenic mice containing a temperature-sensitive mutant allele of p53
also exhibited early aging phenotypes. Tyner et al. (2002) concluded
that p53 has a role in regulating organismal aging.

Garcia-Cao et al. (2002) developed mice carrying supernumerary copies of
the p53 gene in the form of large genomic transgenes. Mice carrying the
p53 transgene alleles in addition to the 2 endogenous alleles exhibited
enhanced response to DNA damage and were significantly protected from
cancer compared with normal mice.

Zhu et al. (2002) reported that mice deficient for both p53 and
nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) succumbed to pro-B cell lymphomas that
featured complex translocations harboring coamplified Myc and IgH
sequences, and they elucidated the molecular mechanism by which these
translocations arose.

Deletion of Trp53 greatly accelerates Myc-induced lymphomagenesis,
resulting in highly disseminated disease (Schmitt et al., 2002). To
determine whether RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of Trp53
could produce a similar phenotype, Hemann et al. (2003) introduced Trp53
short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into hematopoietic stem cells derived from
transgenic E-mu-Myc transgenic mice and monitored tumor onset and
overall pathology in lethally irradiated recipients. Different Trp53
shRNAs produced distinct phenotypes in vivo, ranging from benign
lymphoid hyperplasias to highly disseminated lymphomas, that paralleled
Trp53 -/- lymphomagenesis in E-mu-Myc transgenic mouse. In all cases,
the severity and type of disease correlated with the extent to which
specific shRNAs inhibited p53 activity.

Olive et al. (2004) engineered the structural mutant arg172 to his
(R172H) and the contact mutant arg270 to his (R270H) into the endogenous
p53 locus in mice; the mutations correspond to those of codons 175
(191170.0030) and 273 (191170.0020) in human. p53 R270H/+ and p53
R172H/+ mice were models of Li-Fraumeni syndrome and developed
allele-specific tumor spectra distinct from p53 +/- mice. p53 R270H/-
and p53 R172H/- mice developed novel tumors compared with p53 -/- mice,
including a variety of carcinomas and more frequent endothelial tumors.
Dominant effects that varied by allele and function were observed in
primary cells derived from p53 R270H/+ and p53 R172H/+ mice. Olive et
al. (2004) concluded that point mutant p53 alleles expressed under
physiologic control have enhanced oncogenic potential beyond simple loss
of p53 function.

Lang et al. (2004) generated mice harboring the R172H mutation. p53
+/R172H mice displayed a similar tumor spectrum and survival curve as
p53 +/- mice, but tumors from p53 +/R172H mice metastasized with high
frequency. Embryonic fibroblasts from p53 R172H/R172H mice displayed
enhanced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and transformation
potential. p53 containing R172H bound p63 (TP63; 603273) and p73 (TP73;
601990) in mouse tumor cell lines, and downmodulation of p63 and p73 in
p53 -/- cells increased transformation capacity and reinitiated DNA
synthesis to levels observed in p53 R172H/R172H cells.

Terzian et al. (2008) showed that mice homozygous for the R172H mutation
had unstable mutant p53 in normal cells and stabilized mutant p53 in
some, but not all, tumors. Deletion of Mdm2 or p16(Ink4a), a member of
the Rb tumor suppressor pathway, stabilized mutant p53 and caused an
earlier age of tumor onset, a gain-of-function metastatic phenotype, and
defects in the Rb pathway. Additionally, ionizing radiation stabilized
both wildtype and mutant p53. Terzian et al. (2008) concluded that
stabilization of mutant p53 is a prerequisite for its gain-of-function
phenotype.

Sablina et al. (2005) found that daily dietary supplementation of
Trp53-null mice with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reduced the number
of animals that developed lymphomas.

Erker et al. (2005) showed that treatment of p53-deficient mice with the
nitroxyl antioxidant tempol
(4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) resulted in a small but
significant (25%) increase in life span by prolonging latency to
tumorigenesis, demonstrating that existing oxidative stress and damage
may not be necessary for the chemopreventative effects of tempol. The
relatively small effect on latency in p53-deficient mice and the finding
that tempol-mediated resistance to oxidative insult was p53-dependent
suggested a more direct role of p53 in the chemopreventative effects of
tempol. Tempol treatment specifically increased serine-18
phosphorylation of p53, but not gamma-H2AX (H2AFX; 601772) and p21
(CDKN1A; 116899) expression in primary thymocytes in vitro in a
p53-dependent fashion. Inhibition of PI3K (see 171834) family members
suggested that SMG1 (607032) was responsible for the tempol-mediated
enhancement of p53 serine-18 phosphorylation. Erker et al. (2005)
suggested that the chemopreventative effect of tempol may not be solely
due to the reduction of oxidative stress and damage, but may also be
related to redox-mediated signaling functions that include p53 pathway
activation.

Using the knockin mouse model developed by Christophorou et al. (2005)
in which p53 status can be reversibly switched in vivo between
functional and inactive states, Christophorou et al. (2006) found that
the p53-mediated pathologic response to whole body irradiation, a
prototypic genotoxic carcinogen, was irrelevant for suppression of
radiation-induced lymphoma. In contrast, delaying restoration of p53
function until the acute radiation response subsided abrogated all
radiation-induced pathology yet preserved much of the protection from
lymphoma. Such protection was absolutely dependent on p19(Arf), a tumor
suppressor induced not by DNA damage, but by oncogenic disruption of the
cell cycle.

Efeyan et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Arf responded normally to
DNA damage. Mice with an additional transgenic copy of the p53 gene, or
p53(super) mice, showed the same enhancement of apoptosis irrespective
of whether Arf was present or absent. However, Arf-null cells were
unable to respond effectively to oncogenic signaling and underwent
neoplastic transformation by oncogenes in vitro, irrespective of the
presence or absence of the p53(super) allele. p53(super)/Arf-null mice
succumbed to spontaneous tumors at the same rate as wildtype
p53/Arf-null mice and produced the same profile of sarcomas, lymphomas,
and histiocytic sarcomas. When treated with a DNA-damaging agent,
p53(super)/Arf-null mice did not benefit from the extra p53 allele.
Efeyan et al. (2006) concluded that oncogenic signaling is the critical
event that elicits p53-dependent protection and that DNA damage stimulus
is less important.

Inactivation of both p53 and Brca1 (113705) in mouse mammary gland
mimics the majority of human BRCA1-associated tumors, which also harbor
mutations in both p53 and BRCA1. Poole et al. (2006) found that mammary
glands of nulliparous Brca1/p53-deficient mice accumulated lateral
branches and underwent extensive alveologenesis, a phenotype that occurs
only during pregnancy in wildtype mice. Progesterone receptors, but not
estrogen receptors, were overexpressed in mutant mammary epithelial
cells because of a defect in their degradation by the proteasome
pathway. Treatment of Brca1/p53-deficient mice with a progesterone
antagonist prevented mammary tumorigenesis.

Hu et al. (2007) showed that p53 is important in reproduction in a
gender-specific manner. Significant decreases in embryonic implantation,
pregnancy rate, and litter size were observed in matings with p53 -/-
female mice but not with p53 -/- male mice. Hu et al. (2007) identified
the gene encoding leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; 159540), a cytokine
critical for implantation, as a p53-regulated gene that functions as the
downstream mediator of this effect. p53 can regulate both basal and
inducible transcription of LIF. Loss of p53 decreased both the level and
function of LIF in uteri. Lower LIF levels were observed in the uteri of
p53 -/- mice than in those of p53 +/+ mice, particularly at day 4 of
pregnancy, when transiently induced high levels of LIF were crucial for
embryonic implantation. Hu et al. (2007) suggested that this observation
probably accounts for the impaired implantation of embryos in p53 -/-
female mice. Administration of LIF to pregnant p53 -/- mice restored
maternal reproduction by improving implantation. These results
demonstrated a function for p53 in maternal reproduction through the
regulation of LIF.

Bmi1 (164831) is necessary for the maintenance of adult hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) and neural stem cells. Akala et al. (2008)
demonstrated that bone marrow cells from mice with triple deletion of
p16(Ink4a), p19(Arf) (alternative reading frames of the Cdkn2a gene,
600160), and Trp53, all genetically downstream of Bmi1, have an
approximately 10-fold increase in cells able to reconstitute the blood
long term. This increase was associated with the acquisition of
long-term reconstitution capacity by cells of the phenotype
c-kit+Sca1+Flt3+CD150-CD48-Lin-, which defines multipotent progenitors
in wildtype mice. The pattern of triple mutant multipotent progenitor
response to growth factors resembled that of wildtype multipotent
progenitors but not wildtype HSCs. Akala et al. (2008) concluded that
p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) and Trp53 have a central role in limiting the
expansion potential of multipotent progenitors. The authors commented
that these pathways are commonly repressed in cancer, suggesting a
mechanism by which early progenitor cells could gain the ability to
self-renew and become malignant with further oncogenic mutations.

In a study of mouse pigment mutants Dsk3 and Dsk4, caused by mutation in
the ribosomal proteins Rps19 (603474) and Rps20 (603682), respectively,
McGowan et al. (2008) identified a common pathophysiologic program in
which stabilization of p53 stimulates KIT ligand (184745) expression
and, consequently, epidermal melanocytosis via a paracrine mechanism.
Accumulation of p53 also caused reduced body size and erythrocyte count.
McGowan et al. (2008) concluded that their results provided a
mechanistic explanation for the diverse collection of phenotypes that
accompany reduced dosage of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, and have
implications for understanding normal human variation and human disease.

Begus-Nahrmann et al. (2009) analyzed the functional consequences of
conditional deletion of p53 in late-generation telomerase (Terc; 602322)
knockout mice. Intestinal deletion of p53 shortened the life span of
telomere-dysfunctional mice without inducing tumor formation. In
contrast to deletion of p21 (116899), which elongates life span of
telomere-dysfunctional mice, the deletion of p53 impaired the depletion
of chromosomal-instable intestinal stem cells in aging
telomere-dysfunctional mice. These instable stem cells contributed to
epithelial regeneration leading to an accumulation of chromosomal
instability, increased apoptosis, altered epithelial cell
differentiation, and premature intestinal failure. Begus-Nahrmann et al.
(2009) concluded that their results provided the first experimental
evidence for an organ system in which p53-dependent mechanisms prevent
tissue destruction in response to telomere dysfunction by depleting
genetically instable stem cells.

Ruzankina et al. (2009) reported that p53 deficiency severely
exacerbates tissue degeneration caused by mosaic deletion of the
essential genome maintenance regulator Atr (601215). Combined loss of
Atr and p53 led to severe defects in hair follicle regeneration,
localized inflammation (Mac1+Gr1+ infiltrates), accelerated
deterioration of the intestinal epithelium, and synthetic lethality in
adult mice. Tissue degeneration in double-null mice was characterized by
the accumulation of cells maintaining high levels of DNA damage.
Moreover, the elevated frequency of these damaged cells in both
progenitor and downstream compartments in double-null mouse skin
coincided with delayed compensatory tissue renewal from residual
Atr-expressing cells. Ruzankina et al. (2009) concluded that, taken
together, their results indicated that the combined loss of Atr and
Trp53 in adult mice leads to the accumulation of highly damaged cells,
which, consequently, impose a barrier to regeneration from undamaged
progenitors.

Acute exposure to ionizing radiation can cause lethal damage to the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, a condition called the GI syndrome. Whether
the target cells affected by radiation to cause the GI syndrome are
derived from the epithelium or endothelium and whether the target cells
die by apoptosis or other mechanisms are controversial issues. Studying
mouse models, Kirsch et al. (2010) found that selective deletion of the
proapoptotic genes Bak1 (600516) and Bax (600040) from the GI epithelium
or from endothelial cells did not protect mice from developing the GI
syndrome after subtotal-body gamma irradiation. In contrast, selective
deletion of p53 from the GI epithelium, but not from endothelial cells,
sensitized irradiated mice to the GI syndrome. Transgenic mice
overexpressing p53 in all tissues were protected from the GI syndrome
after irradiation. Kirsch et al. (2010) concluded that the GI syndrome
is caused by the death of GI epithelial cells and that these epithelial
cells die by a mechanism that is regulated by p53 but independent of
apoptosis.

Sahin et al. (2011) used transcriptomic network analyses in mice null
for either Tert or Terc, which exhibit telomere dysfunction, to identify
common mechanisms operative in hematopoietic stem cells, heart, and
liver. Their studies revealed profound repression of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487), coactivator-1
alpha and beta (PCG1-alpha, 604517 and PGC1-beta, 608886), and the
downstream network. Consistent with PGCs as master regulators of
mitochondrial physiology and metabolism, telomere dysfunction was
associated with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and function,
decreased gluconeogenesis, cardiomyopathy, and increased reactive oxygen
species. In the setting of telomere dysfunction, enforced Tert or
PGC1-alpha expression or germline deletion of p53 substantially restored
PGC network expression, mitochondrial respiration, cardiac function, and
gluconeogenesis. Sahin et al. (2011) demonstrated that telomere
dysfunction activates p53 which in turn binds and represses PGC1-alpha
and PGC1-beta promoters, thereby forging a direct link between telomere
and mitochondrial biology. Sahin et al. (2011) proposed that this
telomere-p53-PGC axis contributes to organ and metabolic failure and to
diminishing organismal fitness in the setting of telomere dysfunction.

Elyada et al. (2011) showed that casein kinase I-alpha (CSNK1A1;
600505), a component of the beta-catenin (116806) destruction complex,
is a critical regulator of the Wnt signaling (see 164820) pathway.
Inducing the ablation of Csnk1a1 in the gut triggers massive Wnt
activation, surprisingly without causing tumorigenesis.
CKI-alpha-deficient epithelium shows many of the features of human
colorectal tumors in addition to Wnt activation, in particular the
induction of the DNA damage response and cellular senescence, both of
which are thought to provide a barrier against malignant transformation.
The epithelial DNA damage response in mice is accompanied by substantial
activation of p53, suggesting that the p53 pathway may counteract the
protumorigenic effects of Wnt hyperactivation. Notably, the transition
from benign adenomas to invasive colorectal cancer in humans is
typically linked to p53 inactivation, underscoring the importance of p53
as a safeguard against malignant progression; however, the mechanism of
p53-mediated tumor suppression is unknown. Elyada et al. (2011) showed
that the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis in CKI-alpha-deficient
gut requires p53-mediated growth control, because the combined ablation
of Csnk1a1 and either p53 or its target gene p21 (116899) triggered
high-grade dysplasia with extensive proliferation. Unexpectedly, these
ablations also induced nonproliferating cells to invade the villous
lamina propria rapidly, producing invasive carcinomas throughout the
small bowel. Furthermore, in p53-deficient gut, loss of heterozygosity
of the gene encoding CKI-alpha caused a highly invasive carcinoma,
indicating that CKI-alpha caused a highly invasive carcinoma, indicating
that CKI-alpha functions as a tumor suppressor when p53 is inactivated.
Elyada et al. (2011) identified a set of genes (the p53-suppressed
invasiveness signature, PSIS) that is activated by the loss of both p53
and CKI-alpha and which probably accounts for the brisk induction of
invasiveness. PSIS transcription and tumor invasion were suppressed by
p21, independently of cell cycle control. Restraining tissue invasion
through suppressing PSIS expression is thus a novel tumor suppressor
function of wildtype p53. PROX1 (601546), IFITM2 (605578), and IFITM3
(605579) are all PSIS genes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, ARG248TRP

Malkin et al. (1990) demonstrated that alterations of the TP53 gene
occur not only as somatic mutations in human cancers, but also as
germline mutations in some cancer-prone families. In 2 families with
Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623), they identified a C-to-T mutation at
the first nucleotide of codon 248, changing arginine to tryptophan
(R248W). Loss of the wildtype allele was found in the tumor in some
cases.

By transfection of the R248W mutant into malignant cells, Frebourg et
al. (1992) demonstrated loss of tumor suppressor activity.

.0002
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, GLU258LYS

In a family with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623), Malkin et al.
(1990) identified a G-to-A mutation at the first nucleotide of codon
258, resulting in substitution of lysine for glutamic acid (E258K).

.0003
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, GLY245CYS

In a family with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623), Malkin et al.
(1990) identified a G-to-T mutation at the first nucleotide of codon
245, resulting in substitution of cysteine for glycine (G245C).

Frebourg et al. (1992) showed that the germline G245C mutation resulted
in loss of tumor suppressor activity in malignant cells.

.0004
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, 1-BP DEL, T, CODON 184

In a family with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623), Malkin et al.
(1990) identified deletion of a thymidine at the third nucleotide of
codon 184, resulting in a frameshift and a novel stop at codon 246. This
mutation was reported in the erratum for the article in which Malkin et
al. (1990) had reported that this family had a germline T-to-C change at
the first position of codon 252, resulting in substitution of proline
for leucine (LEU252PRO; L252P).

.0005
CODON 72 POLYMORPHISM, (dbSNP rs1042522)
TP53, PRO72ARG

Ara et al. (1990) reported that the pro72-to-arg (P72R) change in p53 is
caused by polymorphism rather than mutation. Olschwang et al. (1991)
assessed the frequency of the pro72-to-arg (P72R) polymorphism and, from
its frequency in colon cancer patients and control subjects, concluded
that there was no strong association with colon cancer. In both the
cancer group and the control group, the frequencies of the pro72 and
arg72 alleles were about 31 and 69%, respectively.

The E6 oncoprotein derived from tumor-associated human papillomaviruses
(HPVs) binds to and induces degradation of p53. Storey et al. (1998)
investigated the effect of the pro72-to-arg polymorphism on
susceptibility of p53 to E6-mediated degradation and found that the
arg72 form of p53 was significantly more susceptible than the pro72
form. Moreover, allelic analysis of patients with HPV-associated tumors
revealed a striking overrepresentation of homozygous arg72 p53 compared
with the normal population, indicating that individuals homozygous for
arg72 are about 7 times more susceptible to HPV-associated tumorigenesis
than heterozygotes.

Using immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE, Thomas et al. (1999)
found that the arg72 and pro72 p53 variants did not differ in their
ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. They concluded that
arg72 and pro72 are conformationally indistinguishable and that both can
be considered wildtype. However, Thomas et al. (1999) noted that
p53(pro) was a stronger inducer of transcription than p53(arg), whereas
p53(arg) induced apoptosis faster and was a more potent suppressor of
transformation than p53(pro).

Marin et al. (2000) found that some tumor-derived p53 mutants bound and
inactivated p73 (601990). The binding of such mutants was influenced by
whether TP53 codon 72 encoded arginine or proline. The ability of p53 to
bind p73, neutralize p73-induced apoptosis, and transform cells in
cooperation with EJ-Ras (see 190020) was enhanced when codon 72 encoded
arg. Marin et al. (2000) found that the arg-containing allele was
preferentially mutated and retained in squamous cell tumors arising in
arg/pro germline heterozygotes. They concluded that inactivation of p53
family members may contribute to the biologic properties of a subset of
p53 mutants, and that a polymorphic residue within p53 affects mutant
behavior.

Laryngeal papillomatosis is caused by human papillomavirus and is
associated with malignant transformation in 3 to 7% of cases. Aaltonen
et al. (2001) found no difference in the prevalence of the P72R
polymorphism between a group of patients with laryngeal papillomas and a
control group.

The pro72-to-arg polymorphism occurs in the proline-rich domain of p53,
which is necessary for the protein to fully induce apoptosis. Dumont et
al. (2003) found that in cell lines containing inducible versions of
alleles encoding the pro72 and arg72 variants, and in cells with
endogenous p53, the arg72 variant induced apoptosis markedly better than
the pro72 variant. They suggested that at least 1 source of this
enhanced apoptotic potential is the greater ability of the arg72 variant
to localize to mitochondria; this localization was accompanied by
release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.

In 92 Caucasian MLH1 (120436) or MSH2 (609309) mutation carriers,
including 47 with colorectal cancer, Jones et al. (2004) analyzed the
p53 codon 72 genotype and found that arg/pro heterozygotes were 1.94
times more likely to get colorectal cancer during any age interval and
developed it 13 years earlier than arg/arg homozygotes. The number of
pro/pro homozygotes was too small to provide meaningful results.

Kruger et al. (2005) studied the p53 genotype of 167 unrelated patients
with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC; see 120435) with
germline mutations in either MSH2 or MLH1 and found that the median age
of onset was 41 years for arg/arg, 36 years for arg/pro, and 32 years
for pro/pro individuals (p less than 0.0001). There was no difference in
age of onset in 126 patients with microsatellite stable colorectal
cancers. Kruger et al. (2005) concluded that in a mismatch
repair-deficient background, p53 codon 72 genotypes are associated with
the age of onset of colorectal carcinoma in a dose-dependent manner.

Bougeard et al. (2006) studied the effect of the MDM2 SNP309
polymorphism (164785.0001) and the arg72-to-pro polymorphism of the p53
gene on cancer risk in 61 French carriers of the p53 germline mutation.
The mean age of tumor onset in p53 codon 72 polymorphism arg allele
carriers (21.8 years) was different from that of pro/pro patients (34.4
years, p less than 0.05). Bougeard et al. (2006) also observed a
cumulative effect of both polymorphisms because the mean ages of tumor
onset in carriers of MDM2 G and p53 arg alleles (16.9 years) and those
with the MDM2 T/T and p53 pro/pro genotypes (43 years) were clearly
different (p less than 0.02). The results confirmed the impact of the
MDM2 SNP309 G allele on the age of tumor onset in germline p53 mutation
carriers, and suggested that this effect may be amplified by the p53
arg72 allele.

IASPP (607463) is among the most evolutionarily conserved inhibitors of
p53, whereas ASPP1 (606455) and ASPP2 (602143) are activators of p53.
Bergamaschi et al. (2006) showed that, in addition to the DNA-binding
domain, the ASPP family members also bound to the proline-rich region of
p53 containing the codon 72 polymorphism. Furthermore, the ASPP family
members, particularly IASPP, bound to and regulated the activity of p53
pro72 more efficiently than that of p53 arg72.

Orsted et al. (2007) stated that arg72 increases the ability of p53 to
locate to mitochondria and induce cell death, whereas pro72 exhibits
lower apoptotic potential but increases cellular arrest in G1 of the
cell cycle. In a study of 9,219 Danish individuals, they found that
overall 12-year survival was increased in p53 arg/pro heterozygotes by
3% (P of 0.003) and in pro/pro homozygotes by 6% (P of 0.002) compared
with arg/arg homozygotes, corresponding to an increase in median
survival of 3 years for pro/pro versus arg/arg homozygotes. Pro/pro
homozygotes also showed increased survival after development of cancer,
or even after development of other life-threatening diseases, compared
with arg/arg homozygotes. The arg72-to-pro change was not associated
with decreased risk of cancer.

Among 254 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (see 137800), El Hallani
et al. (2009) found an association between the pro72 allele and earlier
age at onset. The pro/pro genotype was present in 20.6% of patients with
onset before age 45 years, compared to in 6.5% of those with onset after
age 45 years (p = 0.002) and 5.9% among 238 controls (p = 0.001). The
findings were confirmed in an additional cohort of 29 patients. The
variant did not have any impact on overall patient survival. Analysis of
tumor DNA from 73 cases showed an association between the pro allele and
a higher rate of somatic TP53 mutations.

Smoking-Related Accelerated Rate of Decline in Lung Function

In a study of 863 individuals with European grandparents from an
unselected New Zealand birth cohort, Hancox et al. (2009) analyzed lung
function (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) between ages 18 and 32 in relation to
cumulative history of cigarette smoking and the dbSNP rs1042522 SNP, and
found that the G allele was associated with smoking-related accelerated
rate of decline in lung function (608852) (FEV1, p = 0.020; FEV1/FVC, p
= 0.037).

HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
CERVICAL CANCER, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
TP53, ARG249SER

Hsu et al. (1991) analyzed for mutations in p53 in hepatocellular
carcinomas (see 114550) from patients in Qidong, an area of high
incidence in China, in which both hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin B1 are
risk factors. Eight of 16 tumors had a G-to-T mutation at the third base
position of codon 249, changing arginine to serine (R249S).

The R249S mutation was found by Crook et al. (1992) in cervical cancer
(603596). They noted that p53 mutations were found in only cervical
cancers that did not show HPV sequences.

In cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (114550) in southern Africa,
Bressac et al. (1991) identified a G-to-T substitution in codon 157 of
TP53, changing valine to phenylalanine (V157F).

.0008
LI-FRAUMENI-LIKE SYNDROME
TP53, CYS242TYR

In a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623) presenting as a
malignant ependymoma of the posterior fossa, Metzger et al. (1991)
identified a germline cys242-to-tyr (C242Y) substitution in the TP53
gene. Tumor tissue from the patient carried the same mutation. Family
history revealed that many members had died of various cancers,
including osteosarcoma and other brain tumors. The mutation was in exon
7 in an area highly conserved across species and a region involved in
several other mutations in neoplasms, including in other families with
Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1. Ependymoma had not previously been observed as a
feature of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Eeles (1995) noted that this family had
tumors characteristic of Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome, but only among
relatives with a third-degree relationship.

.0009
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, GLY245ASP

Srivastava et al. (1990) reported a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1
(151623) in which noncancerous skin fibroblasts from affected
individuals showed an unusual radiation-resistant phenotype. They found
that these cells from 4 family members, spanning 2 generations, had the
same point mutation in codon 245 of the P53 gene. A change from GGC to
GAC predicted substitution of aspartic acid for glycine (G245D). The
fibroblast cell lines retained the normal P53 allele as well. A
different mutation of codon 245 has been observed in a different
Li-Fraumeni family (191170.0003).

LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, ARG248GLN

In 2 of 8 families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623),
Santibanez-Koref et al. (1991) identified mutations in the TP53 gene.
One was the previously described arg248-to-trp mutation (191170.0001).
The second was a novel mutation in the same codon: a CGG-to-CAG change
resulting in substitution of glutamine for arginine (R248Q). Each family
had 2 individuals affected. In the arg248-to-trp family, one individual
had breast cancer at age 33, and the other had rhabdomyosarcoma at age 3
and chondrosarcoma at age 16. In the arg248-to-gln family, one had
bilateral breast cancer at age 25 and leiomyosarcoma at age 44, and the
other had medulloblastoma at age 3 and osteosarcoma at age 8.

Toguchida et al. (1992) also identified an arg248-to-gln change as a
novel germline mutation in a patient with osteosarcoma who had had 2
primary tumors in her lifetime. At 17 years of age she was found to have
osteosarcoma of the right femur, and 2 years later had an osteosarcoma
of her right forearm. She was disease-free until the age of 28 years,
when bilateral breast cancer was diagnosed. Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma
developed in her daughter at the age of 5 years. Both the mother and the
daughter had the same variant band on SSCP analysis of exon 7. The
proband's parents lacked the abnormal band.

In a family with features of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Tachibana et al.
(2000) identified a germline R248Q mutation in the p53 gene. Several
family members developed glioblastoma multiforme (see 137800).

.0011
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, MET133THR

In 9 members of an extended family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623),
Law et al. (1991) found that a germline mutation at codon 133
(ATG-to-ACG), resulting in substitution of threonine for methionine
(M133T), completely cosegregated with the cancer syndrome. An ATG-to-TTG
mutation at codon 133, resulting in substitution of leucine for
methionine, had been reported previously in a sporadic cancer of the
colon (Nigro et al., 1989).

Hung et al. (1999) identified the same M133T mutation in the TP53 gene
in 2 large, apparently unrelated African American families, both of
which had a high incidence of breast cancer and other tumors
characteristic of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Haplotype analysis revealed that
the 2 families shared an identical haplotype. Loss of heterozygosity at
the TP53 locus in tumor tissue from each family was observed; in each
case, the retained allele carried the common haplotype. The frequency of
this haplotype in the general African American population is less than
0.003. This unique haplotype, combined with the rare TP53 mutation,
suggested that these African American families share a common ancestry.
The second proband of Hung et al. (1999) was from the same family as
that in which Law et al. (1991) had originally described the M133T
mutation in relation to Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

.0012
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, VAL272LEU

Felix et al. (1992) examined the p53 gene in primary lymphoblasts of 25
pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia by the RNase
protection assay and by SSCP analysis. In 4 of 25, p53 mutations were
found. In 1 pedigree consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623), a
germline G-to-T transversion at codon 272, changing valine to leucine
(V272L), was found. The proband died at age 19 of ALL. A brother died of
osteogenic sarcoma at the age of 17. Their mother died of uterine cancer
at age 37. Bone cancer was the cause of death in a maternal uncle at age
33, and uterine cancer in the maternal grandmother at the age of about
40.

.0013
HEPATOBLASTOMA
OSTEOSARCOMA, INCLUDED
TP53, SER241PHE

Toguchida et al. (1992) identified a ser241-to-phe (S241F) mutation due
to a TCC-to-TTC change in exon 7 of the p53 gene in a patient whose
hepatoblastoma (see 114550) was diagnosed at the age of 3 months. At the
age of 8 years, multiple foci of osteosarcoma (259500) were discovered
both within and outside the field of radiation therapy for the
hepatoblastoma. SSCP analysis in the family suggested that this was a
novel germline mutation. The same mutation was identified in an
osteosarcoma by Smith-Sorensen et al. (1993).

.0014
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, 1-BP INS, 151C

Toguchida et al. (1992) identified a 1-bp insertion involving codons 151
and 152 of exon 6 of the p53 gene, resulting in a stop codon at position
180, in a patient in whom osteosarcoma was diagnosed at the age of 19
years. He had a family history of cancer consistent with Li-Fraumeni
syndrome-1 (151623). The insertion was a cytosine in a stretch of 5
cytosines spanning codons 151 through 152. The change was predicted to
lead to truncation of 212 amino acids from the p53 protein. His
apparently healthy 4-year-old daughter and 12-year-old nephew also
carried the mutant allele.

.0015
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, 2-BP DEL, CODONS 209-210

Toguchida et al. (1992) identified a 2-bp deletion at codons 209 and 210
of p53, resulting in a premature stop at codon 214, in an 8-year-old
girl with malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Although the father was well,
his brother had died of brain tumor at age 31, his sister of
neurofibrosarcoma at age 17, and his father of pancreatic cancer. Eeles
(1995) classified this family as having classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome
(151623).

.0016
LI-FRAUMENI-LIKE SYNDROME
TP53, 1-BP INS, CODONS 71-72

Toguchida et al. (1992) identified an insertion of 1 cytosine in a
stretch of 6 cytosines spanning codons 71 and 72 of the p53 gene in a
girl who died at the age of 15 of osteosarcoma. The mother had died at
age 25 years of a brain tumor. Eeles (1995) classified this family as
having Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (see 151623).

.0017
LI-FRAUMENI-LIKE SYNDROME
TP53, LYS120TER

Toguchida et al. (1992) identified an AAG-to-TAG change of codon 120 of
the p53 gene, resulting in conversion of lysine to a stop codon (K120X).
The patient had an osteosarcoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung at age 18
years, and brain tumor at the age of 27 years. The patient's mother had
breast cancer at age 25 years. Eeles (1995) classified this family as
having Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (see 151623).

.0018
LI-FRAUMENI-LIKE SYNDROME
TP53, ARG282TRP

Toguchida et al. (1992) identified a CGG-to-TGG change at codon 282 of
the p53 gene, resulting in substitution of tryptophan for arginine
(R282W). The proband had osteosarcoma at age 10 years and had an
extensive family history of malignant tumors with an unusual prevalence
of gastric cancer on the paternal side. The germline mutation in this
family was demonstrated not only by the proband, but also by the
affected father and by 2 apparently healthy sisters, aged 15 and 9 years
at the time of the study. Eeles (1995) classified this family as having
Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (see 151623).

Iavarone et al. (1992) identified the R282W mutation. in a patient with
multifocal osteogenic sarcoma. Further rearrangement of the residual
wildtype allele was detected in tumor tissue.

The germline R282W mutation was identified by Malkin et al. (1992) in a
proband who had liposarcoma diagnosed at the age of 7 years and
osteosarcoma at the age of 12 years.

The R282W mutation was identified in an osteosarcoma by Smith-Sorensen
et al. (1993).

.0019
LI-FRAUMENI-LIKE SYNDROME
TP53, GLY245SER

Toguchida et al. (1992) identified a GGC-to-AGC mutation in the p53
gene, resulting in a gly245-to-ser (G245S) substitution, in a patient
whose osteosarcoma was diagnosed at the age of 18 years. The disease
pursued a rapid course with multiple foci of osteosarcoma and
unsuccessful treatment. The same gly245-to-ser mutation was identified
in his father and younger brother. The father, who was in his
mid-fifties, was healthy but had numerous pigmented, benign nevi. The
brother had a single osteosarcoma at the age of 18 years that was
successfully treated; he also had skin lesions like those of his father.
Eeles (1995) classified this family as having Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome
(see 151623).

.0020
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
THYROID CARCINOMA, ANAPLASTIC, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
TP53, ARG273HIS

Malkin et al. (1992) identified a germline CGT-to-CAT mutation in exon 8
of the p53 gene that converted arg273 to his (R273H). The proband was a
male in whom soft-tissue sarcoma was discovered at the age of 22 years
and gastric carcinoma at the age of 30 years (see LFS; 151623).

In 5 of 6 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid and in an anaplastic
carcinoma thyroid cell line ARO, Fagin et al. (1993) identified the
R273H mutation. The presence of p53 mutations almost exclusively in
poorly differentiated thyroid tumors and thyroid cancer cell lines
suggested that inactivation of p53 may confer these neoplasms with
aggressive properties and may further loss of differentiated function.

.0021
NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA
COLON CANCER, INCLUDED
TP53, GLY325VAL

Malkin et al. (1992) identified a germline GGA-to-GTA mutation in exon 9
of the p53 gene, resulting in a change of gly325 to val (G325V). The
proband had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027) diagnosed at age 17 years and
colon carcinoma (114500) at age 26 years. The patient had a number of
cafe-au-lait spots suggestive of neurofibromatosis. The mother and 1
sister had the same mutation; neither had had cancer, but both had
cystic changes in the breast or ovary, and the sister had evidence of
cervical dysplasia.

NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
TP53, ARG280THR

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (607107) occurs with a particularly high
frequency in southern China and Southeast Asia. It has been proposed
that initiation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma requires expression of the
Epstein-Barr virus, but that induction of preneoplastic events and
maintenance of the tumor-cell phenotype require critical cellular genes.
Sun et al. (1992) found a heterozygous G-to-C transversion at codon 280
(exon 8), position 2, of the TP53 gene, predicted to change arginine to
threonine (R280T), in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line originating
from Guangdong, a province in the People's Republic of China that leads
the world in NPC incidence. However, the mutation was found in only 1 of
12 NPC samples from Hunan, another province in the PRC with high NPC
incidence, and in none of 10 biopsies from Taiwan. Sun et al. (1992)
concluded that alterations in the TP53 gene are not common in NPC.
Normal expression of p53 mRNA in NPC cells as well as no loss of
heterozygosity or gross structural alteration of the TP53 gene was
observed in NPC cell lines and biopsies.

.0025
BREAST CANCER, SOMATIC
TP53, PRO151THR

In a breast cancer (114480), Carrere et al. (1993) identified a
CCC-to-ACC transversion in codon 151 of the p53 gene, resulting in a
substitution of proline by threonine (P151T).

.0026
BREAST CANCER, SOMATIC
TP53, PRO151SER

In a breast cancer (114480), Chen et al. (1991) identified a CCC-to-TCC
transition in codon 151 of the p53 gene, resulting in substitution of
proline by serine (P151S). (In the article by Chen et al. (1991), the
codon was erroneously cited as 149 (Smith, 1993).) A different mutation
in the same codon (191170.0025) has also been identified in a breast
cancer.

.0027
PANCREATIC CANCER, SOMATIC
TP53, LEU35PHE

Casey et al. (1993) found that the TP53 gene was mutated in 8 of 24
pancreatic cancers (260350) examined. One mutation was a G-to-T
transversion at codon 35, resulting in a change from TTG (leu) to TTT
(phe) (L25F). Casey et al. (1993) found no P53 mutations in 8 cases of
chronic pancreatitis.

.0028
LI-FRAUMENI-LIKE SYNDROME
TP53, LEU257GLN

Mazoyer et al. (1994) found constitutional heterozygosity for a
CTG-to-CAG transversion at codon 257 of the TP53 gene, leading to
substitution of glutamine for leucine (L257G). The proband developed
osteosarcoma at age 11 years, phyllodes tumor at the age of 15 years,
and soft-tissue sarcoma at the age of 22 years. No DNA was available
from the deceased mother, who had developed breast cancer at the age of
31 years. Both brothers of the proband, who were healthy at the ages of
22 and 19 years, had the same mutation. Mazoyer et al. (1994) also
identified a different mutation at the same nucleotide of codon 257
(191170.0029) in an unrelated family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623).
Eeles (1995) classified the family with the L257G mutation as having
Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (see 151623).

.0029
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, 1-BP DEL, CODON 257

Mazoyer et al. (1994) found deletion of a single base (CTG to CG) at
codon 257 of the TP53 gene. The deletion predicted a shift in the open
reading frame, producing a mutant protein with 87 C-terminal amino acids
not present in the wildtype protein. Breast cancer, with diagnosis at
age 34 years, was present in the proband. A brother who developed
osteosarcoma at age 31 years had the same mutation. A third sib had the
mutation, but was healthy at age 41 years, although his son had
developed a medulloblastoma at the age of 4 years. The family had
features of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623).

LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, ARG175HIS

Varley et al. (1995) studied an extensively affected 4-generation family
with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623). The structure of the family was
sufficient to establish linkage to TP53. Subsequent DNA sequence
analysis showed a CGC-to-CAC transition in exon 5 of the TP53 gene,
resulting in an arg175-to-his (R175H) substitution that altered a
recognition site for the restriction enzyme HhaI. This LFS family was
unusual for the presence of 2 gastric carcinomas; endometrial cancers
were absent, and malignancies were of early onset and particularly
severe. Two persons developed a childhood sarcoma, and brain tumors were
present in 4. An increase in the risk of breast cancer in mothers of
children with osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma had been reported and was
a phenomenon not demonstrated in this family.

By in vitro studies, Capponcelli et al. (2005) found that R175H
fibroblasts showed increased resistance to doxorubicin treatment with
decreased nuclear localization of the p53 protein compared with wildtype
cells.

.0031
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, LEU344PRO

Varley et al. (1996) described a family with classic Li-Fraumeni
syndrome (151623) in which a leu344-to-pro (L344P) mutation was
identified in the TP53 gene. Codon 344 is a key residue within the
tetramerization domain, and the mutation had profound implications for
tetramerization and potentially for DNA binding. This was the first
report of a mutation in this residue in either sporadic tumors or in the
germline, and it was the first report of a germline mutation within the
tetramerization domain. The family did not appear to be remarkable in
the spectrum of tumors, and there was loss of the wildtype allele in
leiomyosarcoma in the proband. The proband presented at the age of 44
years with a retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma. Previously he had had leg
amputation for osteosarcoma. One brother had died of pancreatic cancer
at the age of 49 years, and a second brother had died of osteosarcoma
under the age of 40 years. The father had died at age 27 years of
esophageal cancer. Many of the family members lived in India.

LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, ALA138PRO

In a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623), Sedlacek et al. (1998)
detected a change of codon 138 from GCC (ala) to CCC (pro) (A138P). The
family was remarkable for 2 early childhood cases of adrenocortical
tumors occurring in sisters at the ages of 1.5 and 0.5 years. The older
sister had also developed rhabdomyosarcoma at the age of 2.5 years. The
girl's grandfather died of renal cell carcinoma at the age of 45 years
and the great-grandparents died of gastric cancer and osteosarcoma at
ages 37 and 45 years, respectively.

.0033
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, 1-BP DEL, CODON 178

In a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-1 (151623), Sedlacek et al. (1998)
found deletion of C from codon 178 (CAC to AC) of the TP53 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature chain termination. Three of 6
tumors examined from this family and the family with the ala138-to-pro
mutation (191170.0032) showed loss of heterozygosity and contained only
the mutant p53 allele. The remaining 3 neoplasms, 2 adrenocortical
tumors and a choroid plexus tumor, retained heterozygosity.
Immunohistochemistry with anti-p53 antibody confirmed accumulation of
p53 protein in tumors with loss of heterozygosity, while the remaining
tumors were p53 negative. These results were interpreted as supporting
the view that complete loss of activity of the wildtype p53 need not be
the initial event in formation of all tumors in LFS. The proband in the
1-bp deletion family had choroid plexus carcinoma at the age of 2 years.
Breast cancer, ovarian cancer, osteosarcoma, liposarcoma, leukemia,
astrocytoma, meningioma, gastric cancer, uterine cancer, and pharyngeal
cancer occurred in other members of the family.

.0034
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, LYS292ILE

In a Turkish family with the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623),
Guran et al. (1999) analyzed the mutation pattern of TP53, p57(KIP2)
(CDKN1C; 600856), p15(INK4B) (CDKN2B; 600431), and p16(INK4A) (CDKN2A;
600160) in the peripheral blood, and loss of heterozygosity
(homo/hemizygous deletion) pattern of TP53 and p15(INK-4B)/p16(INK4A) in
2 tumor tissues. The propositus had a seminoma, his daughter had a
medulloblastoma, and one of his healthy cousins (aged 6 years) had a
TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation, AAA (lys) to ATA (ile) (K292I),
in the peripheral blood cells. Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus
with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene. In
the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter, a
CDKN2A codon 94 missense point mutation, GCG (ala) to GAG (glu)
(600160.0011), was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation. This was
the first time that a mutation in CDKN2A had been observed in
Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

.0035
ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA, PEDIATRIC
TP53, ARG337HIS

The incidence of pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma (202300) in southern
Brazil is 10 to 15 times higher than that of pediatric ADCC worldwide.
Because childhood ADCC is associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623),
Ribeiro et al. (2001) examined the cancer history and p53 status of 36
Brazilian patients and their families. Remarkably, 35 of 36 patients had
an identical germline point mutation in exon 10 of the p53 gene, a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1010 encoding an arg337-to-his (R337H)
amino acid substitution. Differences within intragenic polymorphic
markers demonstrated that at least some mutant alleles arose
independently, thus eliminating the possibility of a founder effect. In
tumor cells, the wildtype allele was deleted, and mutant p53 protein
accumulated within the nuclei. Although these features are consistent
with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-associated adrenal tumors, there was no
history of increased cancer incidence among family members. Therefore,
this inherited R337H p53 mutation represents a low-penetrance p53 allele
that contributes in a tissue-specific manner to the development of
pediatric ADCC.

DiGiammarino et al. (2002) demonstrated that the mutant tetramerization
domain of p53 harboring the R337H mutation adopts a native-like fold but
is less stable than the wildtype domain. Furthermore, the stability of
the p53 R337H-bearing tetramer is highly sensitive to pH in the
physiologic range; this sensitivity correlates with the protonation
state of the mutated his337. DiGiammarino et al. (2002) concluded that
their results demonstrated a pH-sensitive molecular defect of p53,
suggesting that the pH-dependent p53 dysfunction is the molecular basis
for these cases of ADCC in Brazilian children.

Latronico et al. (2001) studied this mutation in a larger series of 55
patients (37 adults and 18 children) with benign and malignant sporadic
adrenocortical tumors. None of the patients had family cancer histories
that conformed to the criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Among the 19
patients with the R337H mutation, only 1 boy and 3 adults showed fatal
evolution or recurrent metastases. This mutation was also identified in
heterozygous state in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of the
patients, indicating that R337H mutation was inherited in most cases.
The authors concluded that the germline R337H mutation of p53 protein is
present at a high frequency (approximately 78%) in children with benign
or malignant sporadic adrenocortical tumors, but it is not restricted to
the pediatric group, since about 14% of adults with adrenocortical
tumors also had this mutation. The presence of this mutation was related
to unfavorable prognosis in most of the adults but not in the children
with adrenocortical tumors.

Longui et al. (2004) investigated the inhibin-alpha (INHA; 147380) gene
in 46 Brazilian children with ADCC, 39 of whom were heterozygous
carriers of R337H. Six patients were heterozygous for 3 INHA mutations,
and Longui et al. (2004) concluded that INHA may be one of the
contributing factors needed for adrenocortical tumor formation in
pediatric patients with the R337H TP53 mutation.

Figueiredo et al. (2006) identified the R337H mutation in 40 children
from southern Brazil with ADCC. The mutation was also identified in
34.5% of relatives tested in parental carrier lines. The penetrance of
ADCC among carriers of R337H was estimated at 9.9%.

Pinto et al. (2005) studied deletion mapping of chromosome 17 in 30
adrenocortical tumors from 29 Brazilian patients (15 children and 14
adults). Sixteen patients had the germline R337H mutation. Loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) analysis using 6 polymorphic microsatellite markers
disclosed loss of the entire chromosome 17 in 18 tumors (10 adenomas and
8 carcinomas) from 17 patients. The R337H mutation was present in 13 of
them. The authors demonstrated a high frequency of biallelic
inactivation of p53 derived from 2 distinct events occurs, the germline
R337H mutation and the acquired loss of the entire chromosome 17. The
isolated loss of the entire chromosome 17 did not correlate with
aggressive tumor behavior in these patients with adrenocortical tumors.

CHOROID PLEXUS PAPILLOMA
OSTEOSARCOMA, INCLUDED
TP53, 7-BP INS, NT13160

In a 29-year-old woman with a rare choroid plexus papilloma (260500) who
had had, at the age of 22 years, an osteosarcoma (259500), Rutherford et
al. (2002) detected a germline 7-bp insertion in exon 5 of the p53 gene.
The alteration was predicted to produce amino acid substitutions
beginning with alanine to glycine at position 161 and a stop codon at
position 182 in the mutated protein. Two assays of p53 function gave
apparently wildtype results on peripheral blood lymphocytes from this
woman. The mutant allele was expressed either at very low levels or not
at all in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. Furthermore, the
mutant protein was completely nonfunctional in terms of its ability to
transactivate a series of p53-responsive genes, to transrepress a target
gene, and to inhibit colony growth in transfected cells. However, data
from irradiated peripheral blood lymphocytes and transfected cells
suggested that this truncated, mutant protein retained significant
ability to induce apoptosis.

.0037
LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, 11-BP DEL/5-BP INS

Most p53 mutations have been found in the DNA-binding domain of the
protein, which results in the loss of p53 transcriptional function.
Birch et al. (1994), however, reported a family with Li-Fraumeni
syndrome-1 (151623) with a p53 mutation in exon 4, outside of the
DNA-binding domain. This mutation involved deletion of 11 bp and
insertion of 5 bp that corresponded to a change in codons 108-111 from
gly-phe-arg-leu to ile-gln, but did not lead to an alteration of the
reading frame. The same mutation was detected in the proband and his
affected mother, indicating that this mutation indeed accounts for the
high incidence of cancer in the family. Gu et al. (2001) investigated
how this mutation affected p53 function and led to malignant
transformation. The mutation resided in the region of the protein
necessary for p53 degradation, which is mediated by MDM2 (164785). Gu et
al. (2001) created an equivalent deletion in a p53 expression construct
and functionally characterized it. They demonstrated that a mutation in
this region is associated not only with resistance of the mutant p53 to
MDM2-mediated degradation, but also with an impaired response of mutant
protein to DNA damage. In addition, the mutant protein was defective in
its transactivation function, which correlated with its inability to
suppress cell growth and to induce apoptosis. The molecular basis for
the mutant form of p53 responsible for LFS in this family appears to be
its predominantly cytoplasmic localization caused by a faulty nuclear
import mechanism which, at least in part, results from the mutant's
decreased affinity to importin (602738).

.0038
COLORECTAL CANCER
TP53, ALA189VAL

During a search for causative genes in patients with concurrent multiple
primary colon tumors (see 114500), Miyaki et al. (2003) identified a
germline mutation of the p53 gene, from GCC (ala) to GTC (val) at codon
189 (A189V), in a 73-year-old man. Of the 6 primary colon tumors that
this patient had, 1 large advanced carcinoma exhibited a somatic
mutation in the p53 gene and a somatic mutation in the APC gene (611731)
in addition to the germline p53 mutation. Two early carcinomas and 3
adenomas had somatic APC mutations but no somatic p53 mutation or loss
of the p53 allele. Mutations of the KRAS2 gene (190070) were detected in
an advanced carcinoma and an early carcinoma. The findings were
interpreted as indicating that certain types of germline p53 mutations
predispose to concurrent multiple colon tumors. The results also
suggested that in patients with such mutations, a somatic APC mutation
is involved in tumor formation and that an additional somatic p53
mutation contributes to tumor progression.

LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME 1
TP53, TYR220SER

In a mother and her 3 children with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623),
Capponcelli et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous germline 659A-C
transversion in exon 6 of the TP53 gene, resulting in a tyr220-to-ser
(Y220S) substitution. Loss of heterozygosity for wildtype p53 was
observed in all available tumor samples. All affected family members had
an aggressive clinical phenotype associated with resistance to
doxorubicin and early death from cancer. Supernatant from Y220S
fibroblasts induced significantly increased neoangiogenesis on gelatin
sponge chorioallantoic membranes compared to wildtype. In vitro, Y220S
fibroblasts showed increased resistance to doxorubicin with decreased
nuclear p53 localization and increased levels of peroxiredoxin II
(PRDX2; 600538) and thioredoxin (TXN; 187700), both of which reduce
reactive oxygen species. The findings suggested a mechanism for
chemoresistance conferred by the Y220S mutation.

ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA, PEDIATRIC
CHOROID PLEXUS CARCINOMA, INCLUDED
TP53, GLU285VAL

In a male infant who developed an adrenocortical carcinoma (202300) and
a choroid plexus carcinoma (see 260500) by age 1.5 years, Russell-Swetek
et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous de novo A-to-T transversion in
the TP53 gene, resulting in a glu285-to-val (E285V) substitution in the
DNA binding domain. Immunohistochemical analysis showed strong positive
staining for p53 in the nuclei of both types of cancer cell, consistent
with these tumors expressing the mutant p53 protein. Functional analyses
of E285V revealed significant defects in its ability to regulate
promoter activity, suppress tumor cell growth, and trigger apoptosis.
The mutant protein also functioned efficiently as a dominant-negative
regulator that neutralized wildtype p53 activity.

BASAL CELL CARCINOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 7
TP53, A-C, 3-PRIME UTR (dbSNP rs78378222)

In the discovery phase of a genomewide association study of 16 million
SNPs identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders,
Stacey et al. (2011) identified association of a single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the TP53 gene, dbSNP rs78378222C, with
susceptibility to basal cell carcinoma (BCC7; 614740). Stacey et al.
(2011) then confirmed this association in non-Icelandic samples (OR =
1.75, p = 0.0060; overall OR = 2.16, p = 2.2 x 10(-20)). The SNP dbSNP
rs78378222 is in the 3-prime untranslated region of TP53 and changes the
AATAAA polyadenylation signal to AATACA. Studies of RNA from dbSNP
rs78378222A/C heterozygotes and A/A homozygotes suggested that the dbSNP
rs78378222C variant impairs proper termination and polyadenylation of
the TP53 transcript.

.0042
GLIOMA SUSCEPTIBILITY 1
TP53, ARG181LEU

In a patient with a multifocal anaplastic astrocytoma (GLM1; 137800),
Kyritsis et al. (1994) identified a germline G-to-T transversion in the
TP53 gene, resulting in an arg181-to-leu (R181L) substitution. The
patient had no family history of cancer, except for a maternal aunt with
cervical cancer.

612344	TITLE *612344 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 385B; ZNF385B
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 533; ZNF533
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The ZNF385B gene encodes a protein that contains 4 U1-type zinc fingers
and shares 93% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. ZNF385B is
expressed in brain. Because of its putative nuclear location, Monfort et
al. (2008) hypothesized a role in RNA maturation, stability, or
transcription regulation.

MAPPING

The ZNF385B gene maps to chromosome 2q31.2 (Monfort et al., 2008).

CYTOGENETICS

Monfort et al. (2008) reported a 14-year-old boy with moderate mental
retardation and dysmorphic features associated with a de novo 3.3-Mb
interstitial deletion at chromosome 2q31.2 (612345), spanning 16 genes
with ZNF385B being the most distal gene lost. The authors identified a
0.5-Mb overlapping deleted region in their patient and the patient
reported by Mencarelli et al. (2007), containing only the ZNF385B gene.
The authors noted that X-linked mental retardation has been associated
with other zinc finger proteins, including ZNF41 (314995), ZNF81
(314998), and ZNF674 (300573). Monfort et al. (2008) suggested that
loss-of-function mutations in zinc finger genes may play a common role
in human cognitive processes.

614960	TITLE *614960 PHOSPHOLIPASE D FAMILY, MEMBER 6; PLD6
;;MITOCHONDRIAL PHOSPHOLIPASE; MITOPLD;;
ZUCCHINI, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; ZUC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PLD6 is a mitochondrial member of the phospholipase D family of enzymes
(EC 3.1.4.4). PLD6 converts cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid on the
cytoplasmic surface of mitochondria, which induces mitochondrial fusion
(Choi et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching a genomic database for sequences encoding a catalytic HKD
motif, as in PLD1 (602382), Choi et al. (2006) identified PLD6, which
they called MitoPLD. The deduced 252-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, followed by a conserved RGV
motif and a single HKD half-catalytic site with the active site his156.
Database analysis revealed that MitoPLD is a highly divergent ancestral
enzyme most similar to bacterial cardiolipin synthase and the bacterial
endonuclease Nuc. In transfected cell lines, fluorescence-tagged MitoPLD
localized to mitochondria. Western blot analysis detected only
full-length MitoPLD, suggesting that the mitochondrial targeting signal
is not cleaved but functions as a membrane anchor. Protease digestion
experiments confirmed that MitoPLD localized to the mitochondrial outer
membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

Using SDS-PAGE, Choi et al. (2006) found that epitope-tagged MitoPLD
immunoprecipitated as dimers. Overexpression of MitoPLD in mouse
fibroblasts resulted in aggregation of enlarged perinuclear
mitochondria. Mutant MitoPLD with inactivation of the catalytic
histidine or knockdown of endogenous MitoPLD via short hairpin RNA
resulted in fragmentation of the normal tubular mitochondrial structure.
Knockdown of both mitochondrial fusion proteins Mfn1 (608506) and Mfn2
(608507), but neither mitofusion alone, abrogated formation of
MitoPLD-induced mitochondrial aggregates. MitoPLD overexpression
resulted in decreased mitochondrial content of cardiolipin and increased
phosphatidic acid. Recombinant MitoPLD reconstituted in liposomes
converted cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid and required the active site
his156.

Using NIH 3T3 cells, Huang et al. (2011) found that overexpression of
MitoPLD recruited the b isoform of Lpin1 (605518) to the mitochondrial
surface, resulting in dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to generate
diacylglycerol and termination of phosphatidic acid-dependent
mitochondrial fusion. Knockdown and overexpression studies with HeLa
cells confirmed the opposing actions of MitoPLD and LPIN1 in
mitochondrial fusion and fission, respectively.

Ipsaro et al. (2012) produced a dimeric soluble fragment of the mouse
Zucchini homolog (mZuc, also known as PLD6) and showed that it possesses
single-strand-specific nuclease activity. Crystal structure and other
data led Ipsaro et al. (2012) to conclude that the Zucchini proteins act
in primary PIWI (see 605571)-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis as
nucleases, perhaps generating the 5-prime ends of primary piRNAs.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Ipsaro et al. (2012) solved the crystal structure of mouse Pld6 at
1.75-angstrom resolution. The structure indicated greater architectural
similarity to phospholipase-D family nucleases than to phospholipases.

Nishimasu et al. (2012) solved the crystal structure of Drosophila
melanogaster Zuc at 1.75-angstrom resolution. The structure revealed
that Zuc has a positively charged, narrow catalytic groove at the dimer
interface, which could accommodate a single-stranded, but not a
double-stranded, RNA. Drosophila and mouse Zuc (also known as Pld6 and
MitoPLD) both showed endoribonuclease activity for single-stranded RNAs
in vitro. The RNA cleavage products bear a 5-prime-monophosphate group,
a hallmark of mature piRNAs. Mutational analyses revealed that the
conserved active-site residues of Drosophila Zuc are critical for the
ribonuclease activity in vitro, and for piRNA maturation and transposon
silencing in vivo. Nishimasu et al. (2012) proposed a model for piRNA
biogenesis in animal germ lines, in which the Zuc endoribonuclease has a
key role in primary piRNA maturation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the PLD6 gene to chromosome 17p11.2 based on an
alignment of the PLD6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK090899) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Huang et al. (2011) found that MitoPLD -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio and were indistinguishable from wildtype.
However, male MitoPLD -/- mice were infertile, and MitoPLD -/- testes
were reduced in size and lacked postmeiotic spermatocytes and
spermatids. Cells within tubules appeared apoptotic, with disorganized
chromosomal material. Meiotic arrest was accompanied by loss of
mitochondrial nuage, or intermitochondrial cement, and absence of Tdrd1
(605796), a component of the Piwi (see PIWIL1; 605571)-interacting RNA
(piRNA) pathway for control of transposon-generated genomic damage.
Huang et al. (2011) concluded that mitochondrial surface phosphatidic
acid generated by MitoPLD recruits or activates nuage components
critical for piRNA production and genomic stability.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using mouse Hes2 as query, Katoh and Katoh (2004)
identified human HES2. The deduced 173-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix domain, followed by an orange domain,
a proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal WRPW motif. HES2 ESTs were found
in a placenta cDNA library and in several cancer cDNA libraries.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the HES2 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the HES2 and

;;TONICITY-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN; TONEBP;;
NFAT-LIKE PROTEIN 1; NFATL1;;
KIAA0827
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tonicity-responsive enhancers (TonEs) in kidney medulla cells play a key
role in hypertonicity-induced transcriptional stimulation of
sodium/myoinositol cotransporter (SLC5A3; 600444),
sodium/chloride/betaine cotransporter (SLC6A12; 603080), and aldose
reductase (AKR1B1; 103880). Using a yeast 1-hybrid strategy followed by
screening of a HeLa cDNA library, Miyakawa et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding NFAT5, which they called TONEBP (TonE-binding protein). By
searching an EST database for sequences related to NFATC family members
(e.g., NFATC1; 600489), Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (1999) also isolated a
cDNA encoding NFAT5. The 1,455-amino acid NFAT5 protein contains a
region near the N terminus that has high homology to the Rel-like
DNA-binding domain of the NFATC family. However, NFAT5 lacks the
N-terminal sequence that functions as an interface for calcineurin (see
114105) and regulatory kinases. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 13-kb NFAT5 transcript that was ubiquitously expressed. By
electrophoretic mobility shift analyses, Miyakawa et al. (1999) showed
that the NFAT5 Rel region binds to TonE DNA, and Lopez-Rodriguez et al.
(1999) showed that it binds to sequences similar to those preferred by
NFATC1, but not to FOS (164810) or JUN (165160). Western blot analysis
detected expression of a 200-kD NFAT5 protein in a kidney cell line
(Lopez-Rodriguez et al., 1999). By immunostaining, Miyakawa et al.
(1999) showed that NFAT5 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus of
isotonic kidney cells, but is found predominantly in the nucleus of
cells cultured in hypertonic medium; Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (1999)
detected staining only in the nucleus of resting and stimulated T
lymphocytes, HeLa cells, and myoblast cells.

By Western blot analysis of mouse tissue, Trama et al. (2000) detected
abundant expression of NFAT5, which they termed NFATL1, in thymus, with
much lower amounts in testis, lung, and brain, and no expression in
other tissues, including lymph nodes. Stimulated mouse splenocytes
expressed NFAT5, whereas quiescent mouse splenocytes and T cells exposed
to cyclosporin A or FK506 did not. Reporter gene analysis showed that
T-cell receptor cross-linking resulted in the induction of NFAT5 in
human Jurkat cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Jauliac et al. (2002) found that both NFATC2 (600490) and NFAT5 were
expressed in invasive human ductal breast carcinomas. Using cell lines
derived from breast and colon carcinomas, they found that these NFATs
promoted carcinoma invasion and that their activity correlated with
expression of alpha-6 (147556)/beta-4 (147557) integrin. The
transcriptional activity of NFAT5 was induced by alpha-6/beta-4
clustering in the presence of chemoattractants, resulting in enhanced
cell migration. Jauliac et al. (2002) determined that the activity of
NFAT5 required an intact beta-4 cytoplasmic tail.

In studies in rats, Machnik et al. (2009) demonstrated that TONEBP-VEGFC
(601528) signaling in mononuclear phagocytes is a major determinant of
extracellular volume and blood pressure homeostasis, and is intimately
involved in salt-induced hypertension (see 145500).

Kleinewietfeld et al. (2013) demonstrated that increased salt
concentrations found locally under physiologic conditions in vivo
markedly boost the induction of murine and human T(H)17 cells. High-salt
conditions activated the p38/MAPK (600289) pathway involving NFAT5 and
serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK1; 602958) during
cytokine-induced T(H)17 polarization. Gene silencing or chemical
inhibition of p38/MAPK, NFAT5, or SGK1 abrogated the high-salt-induced
T(H)17 cell development. The T(H)17 cells generated under high-salt
conditions displayed a highly pathogenic and stable phenotype
characterized by the upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines GMCSF
(138960), TNF-alpha (191160), and IL2 (147680). Moreover, mice fed with
a high-salt diet developed a more severe form of autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), in line with augmented central nervous system
infiltrating and peripherally induced antigen-specific T(H)17 cells.
Thus, Kleinewietfeld et al. (2013) suggested that increased dietary salt
intake might represent an environmental risk factor for the development
of autoimmune diseases through the induction of pathogenic T(H)17 cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the NFAT5
gene, which they called KIAA0827, to chromosome 16. Hebinck et al.
(2000) mapped the NFAT5 gene to chromosome 16q22.1 by FISH and radiation
hybrid analysis. Using the latter method, they mapped the mouse homolog
to chromosome 8D.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2004) found that homozygous Nfat5-deficient mice
were genetically underrepresented after embryonic day 14.5. Surviving
mice manifested a progressive and profound atrophy of the kidney medulla
with impaired activation of several osmoprotective genes, including
Akr1b1, Slc6a12, and Slc5a3. The Akr1b1 gene is controlled by a
tonicity-responsive enhancer, which was refractory to hypertonic stress
in fibroblasts lacking Nfat5, establishing this enhancer as a direct
transcriptional target of NFAT5. Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2004) concluded
that NFAT5 is a tonicity-responsive transcription factor with a central
role in kidney homeostasis and function.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The estrogen receptor (ESR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor
composed of several domains important for hormone binding, DNA binding,
and activation of transcription. Alternative splicing results in several
ESR1 mRNA transcripts, which differ primarily in their 5-prime
untranslated regions. The translated receptors show less variability
(Kos et al., 2001; Flouriot et al., 2000).

CLONING

Walter et al. (1985) cloned and Greene et al. (1986) sequenced a cDNA
for the entire translated portion of the messenger RNA for the estrogen
receptor of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Expression with production
of a functional protein was accomplished in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
The 1,785 nucleotides of the cDNA correspond to a polypeptide of 595
amino acids and a molecular weight of 66,200 (about that estimated from
other studies of the estrogen receptor). Amino acid sequence comparisons
showed considerable similarities between human ESR, human GCR (138040),
and the putative v-erbA (190120) oncogene product. Both ESR and GCR
exert their effects by binding directly to an intranuclear receptor
molecule that is weakly associated with nuclear components in the
absence of ligand. Binding of hormone to its receptor results in
conversion of the receptor-steroid complex to a form that binds with
high affinity to nuclear components. Green et al. (1986) also cloned and
sequenced human estrogen receptor cDNA, using the breast cancer cell
line MCF-7. They found extensive homology between ESR cDNA and the ERBA
oncogene.

Flouriot et al. (2000) cloned a 46-kD isoform of ESR1 that lacks 173
N-terminal amino acids present in the major 66-kD isoform. These amino
acids form a ligand-independent transactivation domain. The 46-kD
isoform retains the DNA-binding domains and the hormone-binding domain,
which includes the functional domain for hormone-inducible transcription
activation.

Li et al. (2003) confirmed that the 46-kD endothelial cell protein
(ESR46) is an N-terminal truncated product of full-length ESR-alpha
(ESR66) that results from alternative splicing. ESR46 is expressed in
the plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus of resting, estrogen-deprived
cells. They found that ESR46 is localized and further dynamically
targeted to the plasma membrane in a palmitoylation-dependent manner.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Shiau et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the human ESRA
ligand-binding domain (LBD) bound to both the agonist diethylstilbestrol
(DES) and a peptide derived from the nuclear receptor (NR) box II region
of the coactivator GRIP1 (601993) as well as the crystal structure of
the ESRA-LBD bound to the selective antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT).
In the DES-LBD-peptide complex, the peptide binds as a short alpha helix
to a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the LBD. In the OHT-LBD
complex, helix 12 occludes the coactivator recognition groove by
mimicking the interactions of the NR box peptide with the LBD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ponglikitmongkol et al. (1988) showed that the human ESR gene is more
than 140 kb long. It contains 8 exons, and the position of its introns
has been highly conserved, being, for example, remarkably similar to
those of one of the chicken thyroid hormone receptor genes.

Kos et al. (2001) reviewed the organization of the ESR1 gene. They
described promoters used in the generation of ESR1 transcripts in human
and other species and suggested a consistent nomenclature. The possible
role of multiple promoters in the differential expression of ESR1 in
tissues and during development was also discussed.

MAPPING

Walter et al. (1985) determined that the human ESR gene maps to
chromosome 6. By in situ hybridization, using a cDNA probe containing
the coding sequence for the estrogen receptor, Gosden et al. (1986)
assigned the gene to 6q24-q27. Zuppan et al. (1989) reported linkage
data between the ESR locus and MYB (189990) and TCP10 (187020) on
chromosome 6q. The estimated recombination fractions were 0.19 between
ESR and MYB and 0.14 between ESR and TCP10, assuming equal male and
female recombination fractions. To localize ESR more precisely, Menasce
et al. (1993) isolated a YAC containing the gene and mapped it to 6q25.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a new simple method of
post-FISH chromosome banding. Using a single interspecific backcross,
Justice et al. (1990) demonstrated the genetic location of the Esr gene
in relation to other loci on mouse chromosome 10.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a construct containing the human estrogen receptor cDNA with a
yeast PGK promoter, Metzger et al. (1988) demonstrated that the human
estrogen receptor can be expressed in yeast. Initiation of transcription
in the system operated in a strictly hormone-dependent manner,
documenting an extraordinarily high level of conservation of this
activation mechanism.

Issa et al. (1994) reported that CpG island methylation, an epigenetic
modification of DNA known to correlate closely with silencing of gene
transcription, appears in the ESR gene in a subpopulation of cells that
increases as a direct function of age in human colonic mucosa. They
found that the same methylation change characterized almost all cells in
the 45 colorectal tumors examined, including the earliest stages of
tumor formation. ESR gene expression is diminished or absent in
colorectal tumors, and introduction of an exogenous ESR gene in cultured
colon carcinoma cells was found to result in marked growth suppression.
Issa et al. (1994) concluded that methylation-associated inactivation of
the ESR gene in aging colorectal mucosa may be one of the earliest
events that predispose to sporadic colorectal tumorigenesis.

One mechanism suggested to play a role in the progression of human
breast cancer from hormone dependence to independence is the expression
or altered expression of mutant and/or variant forms of the estrogen
receptor. Murphy et al. (1996) stated that 2 major types of variant ESR
mRNA had been reported in human breast biopsy samples so far: truncated
transcripts and exon-deleted transcripts. Murphy et al. (1996) provided
data on a novel type of abnormal ESR mRNA. They found
larger-than-wildtype ESR mRNA RT-PCR products in 9.4% of 212 human
breast tumors analyzed. Cloning and sequencing of these larger RT-PCR
products showed 3 different types: complete duplication of exon 6 in
7.5%; complete duplication of exons 3 and 4 in 1 tumor; and a 69-bp
insertion between exons 5 and 6 in 3 tumors. While it is unknown if
these novel ESR-like mRNAs are stably translated in vivo, any resulting
protein would be structurally altered, possibly resulting in altered
function.

Two isoforms of the human ESR, ESRA and ESR-beta (ESR2; 601663), occur,
each with distinct tissue and cell patterns of expression. Additional
ESR isoforms, generated by alternative mRNA splicing, have been defined
in several tissues and are postulated to play a role in tumorigenesis or
in modulating the estrogen response. By RT-PCR and hybridization
blotting analysis, Shupnik et al. (1998) examined 71 human pituitary
adenomas of varying phenotypes and 6 normal pituitary specimens for ESR
mRNA isoforms. All 14 prolactinomas contained ESRA, and 5 of 14
contained ESRB mRNA. In comparison, 6 tumors that expressed prolactin
(176760) and growth hormone (GH; 139250) expressed ESRB (4 of 6) more
frequently than ESRA (3 of 6). ESRB mRNA was also found more frequently
in null cell (8 of 24 ESRA and 14 of 24 ESRB) and gonadotrope (13 of 21
ESRA and 18 of 21 ESRB) tumors. Additionally, ESRB was found in 4 of 6
tumors that contained only GH, although ESRA was not observed in this
tumor type. Expression of the 2 ESR isoforms within a tumor type was
overlapping, but some tumors contained only 1 isoform. Expression of
ESRA mRNA splice variants also varied with cell type. All normal
pituitaries contained ESRA deletions of exon 4, 5, and 7, whereas only 2
of 6 samples contained the exon 2 deletion variant. Although the same
ESRA mRNA variants were observed among the various tumor types, the
proportion of specific splice variants expressed varied. The authors
concluded that expression of the ESR isoforms, as well as of the mRNA
splice variants, may influence the biologic properties of these tumors
and affect their ability to respond to estrogen and antiestrogen
therapies.

Vaults are large ribonucleoprotein particles composed largely of MVP
(605088). Abbondanza et al. (1998) found that MVP coprecipitated with ER
from nuclear extracts of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and that ER
associated with intact vaults. Mutation analysis showed that a central
region of ER containing nuclear localization signals was involved in the
interaction. A limited amount of ER molecules in the nuclear extract
appeared to be associated with MVP. Physiologic concentrations of
estradiol increased the amount of MVP present in MCF-7 nuclear extracts
and coimmunoprecipitated with ER. The hormone-dependent interaction of
vaults with ER was reproduced in vitro.

Lawson et al. (1999) studied ESR1 expression in normal breast tissue
biopsies obtained by open surgical and core biopsy of benign lesions of
the breast from 74 white Australian women and 92 Japanese women. Among
Australians, the median of the percentage of ESR1-positive cells is
about 12% for women younger than 50 years and 17% among women 50 years
or older. Among Japanese, the overall median is about 9% and does not
vary substantially with age. The authors concluded that their results
are compatible with the hypothesis that the expression of estrogen
receptors in normal breast tissue increases the risk of breast cancer
and explains the 5-fold contrast of breast cancer incidence between
white and Asian women. The difference in estrogen receptor expression as
well as in breast cancer incidence between white and Japanese is more
evident among older women.

Primary transcripts of the human ESR and progesterone receptor (PGR;
607311) genes undergo a number of alternative-splicing events that
result in a range of variant mRNA isoforms in receptor-positive tissues.
Despite in vitro demonstrations of a possible role for some of these
isoforms in hormonal sensitivity, the clinical significance of this
process is uncertain. By RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis, Balleine et
al. (1999) documented the coexpression of variant ESR and PGR
transcripts in a series of receptor-positive breast tumors. In 35
ESR-positive tumors, a common profile of variant ESR transcripts was
present, with all tumors containing the exon 2-deleted and exon
7-deleted ESR variants, 94% containing the exon 4-deleted ESR variant,
and 83% containing the exon 5-deleted ESR variant. In 25 of these cases,
which were also PGR positive, the most highly expressed PGR variants,
the exon 4-deleted PGR, exon 6-deleted PGR, and delta-4/2PGR, a
transcript from which a 126-bp portion of PGR exon 4 was deleted, were
detected in more than 90% of the cases. The alternatively spliced ESR
isoforms were expressed at higher relative levels than the PGR isoforms,
which had mean levels of expression less than 10% that of wildtype PGR.
The most abundant isoform was the exon 7-deleted ESR, which was present
at levels ranging from 29 to 83% of the wildtype. Balleine et al. (1999)
concluded that the common profile of alternatively spliced ESR and PGR
transcripts seen in breast tumors precludes its use as a discriminator
of hormone responsiveness or other clinical end points. Furthermore, the
low level of expression of the majority of variant isoforms called into
question their potential for impacting significantly on receptor
function.

Using transient transfection assays, Fan et al. (1999) demonstrated that
BRCA1 inhibits signaling by the ligand-activated estrogen receptor
ESR-alpha through the estrogen-responsive enhancer element and blocks
the C-terminal transcriptional activation function AF2 of ESR-alpha.
These results suggested that wildtype BRCA1 protein may function, in
part, to suppress estrogen-dependent mammary epithelial proliferation by
inhibiting ESR-alpha-mediated transcriptional pathways related to cell
proliferation, and that loss of this ability may contribute to
tumorigenesis.

Chaidarun and Alexander (1998) examined the effects of a human ESR1
isoform on estrogen-mediated gene activation in U2-OS osteosarcoma
cells. ESR1-5, an ESR1 variant generated by an alternate splice event
that omits exon 5 and alters the reading frame of the resulting mRNA,
was coexpressed with normal ESR1 in several estrogen-responsive
neoplastic tissues. ESR1-5 encodes the hormone-independent
trans-activating function (AF-1), as well as the constitutive receptor
dimerization and DNA-binding domains. The ESR1-5 protein is prematurely
truncated and lacks the majority of the hormone-binding and activating
function-2 (AF-2) domains. When ESR1-5 was cotransfected with normal
ESR1, both basal and estrogen-stimulated reporter activation were
increased approximately 500% over the levels observed when cells were
transfected with ESR1 alone. Electromobility shift/supershift assays
using nuclear extracts of U2-OS cells stably transfected with ESR1 and
ESR1-5 confirmed the constitutive binding of ESR1-5 and ESR1 protein to
the estrogen-response element (ERE) sequence independent of estrogen,
and also showed an increase in ESR1-5/ESR1-ERE complexes with estrogen
treatment. These data were considered to be consistent with the
interactive effects of normal ESR1 and ESR1-5 on transcription from
classic ERE gene promoters. Chaidarun and Alexander (1998) concluded
that ESR1-5 acts as a dominant-positive receptor that increases both
basal and estrogen-stimulated gene transactivation of normal ESR1.

Ye et al. (2000) investigated the expression of ESR1 in prostate cancer
cell lines and unexpectedly found a FASN/ESR1 fusion transcript. Using
semi-nested RT-PCR analysis of ESR1 and its variants, Ye et al. (2000)
found that the N-terminal coding region of FASN containing domain 1 was
fused to the C-terminal coding region of the ESR1 ligand binding domain.
Nested RT-PCR also detected the fusion transcript in breast, cervical,
and bladder cancer cell lines.

Esmaeli et al. (2000) found immunohistochemical evidence that estrogen
receptors are present in the meibomian glands of the upper eyelid.
Unlike sebaceous glands elsewhere on the skin, the meibomian glands lack
androgen receptors. Esmaeli et al. (2000) suggested that these eyelid
estrogen receptors may play a role in modulation of the tear film lipid
layer. They concluded that estrogen receptor activity may be linked to
meibomian gland dysfunction and dry eye syndrome.

ESR1 is downregulated in the presence of its cognate ligand, estradiol,
through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Lonard et al. (2000) showed
that ubiquitin proteasome function is required for ESR1 to serve as a
transcriptional activator. Deletion of the last 61 amino acids of ESR1,
including residues that form helix 12, abolished ligand-mediated
downregulation of the receptor, as did point mutations in the
ligand-binding domain that impaired coactivator binding. In addition,
the authors found that coactivators also are subject to degradation by
the 26S proteasome, but their intrinsic transcriptional activity is not
affected. These data provided evidence that protein interactions with
ESR1 coactivator binding surfaces are important for ligand-mediated
receptor downregulation and suggested that receptor and coactivator
turnover contributes to ESR1 transcriptional activity.

Simoncini et al. (2000) showed that the estrogen receptor isoform
ESR-alpha binds in a ligand-dependent manner to the p85-alpha (171833)
regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxy kinase (PI3K).
Stimulation with estrogen increases ESR-alpha-associated PI3K activity,
leading to the activation of protein kinase B/AKT (164730) and
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; 163729). Recruitment and
activation of PI3K by ligand-bound ESR-alpha are independent of gene
transcription, do not involve phosphotyrosine adaptor molecules or src
homology domains of p85-alpha, and extend to other steroid hormone
receptors. Mice treated with estrogen showed increased eNOS activity and
decreased vascular leukocyte accumulation after ischemia and reperfusion
injury. This vascular protective effect of estrogen was abolished in the
presence of PI3K or eNOS inhibitors. Simoncini et al. (2000) concluded
that their findings defined a physiologically important nonnuclear
estrogen-signaling pathway involving the direct interaction of ESR-alpha
with PI3K.

Pelletier and El-Alfy (2000) studied the immunocytochemical localization
of ESRA and ESRB in human reproductive tissues. In the ovary, ESRB
immunoreactivity was found in nuclei of granulosa cells of growing
follicles at all stages from primary to mature follicles, interstitial
gland, and germinal epithelium cells. Nuclear staining for ESRA occurred
in thecal, interstitial gland, and germinal epithelium cells. In the
uterus, strong ESRA immunoreactivity was detected in nuclei of
epithelial, stromal, and muscle cells. Similar localization was obtained
for ESRB, although the staining was much weaker. In the vagina, only
ESRA could be detected; a nuclear reaction was observed in deep layers
of the stratified epithelium as well as in stromal and muscle cells. In
the mammary gland, both ESR subtypes were observed in epithelial and
stromal cells. In the testis, ESRB was detected in the nuclei of Sertoli
and Leydig cells, whereas ESRA immunoreactivity was only observed in
Leydig cells, with no tubular labeling. In the efferent ducts, only ESRB
could be detected, whereas neither ESRB nor ESRA could be found in the
epididymis. In the prostate, ESRB nuclear immunolabeling was observed in
both basal and secretory cells in alveoli as well as in stromal cells,
whereas ESRA could not be detected. The authors concluded that there is
a cell-specific localization for each of the ESR subtypes in the
majority of the reproductive organs studied.

Chiang et al. (2000) examined the regulation of ESRA and ESRB expression
by human chorionic gonadotropin (CG; see 118850) in human
granulosa-luteal cells. CG treatment significantly attenuated the ESRA
(45%) and ESRB (40%) mRNA levels. The CG-induced decrease in ESRA and
ESRB expression was mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin treatment.
Next, the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH; 152760) on
estrogen receptor expression was studied. Sixty-eight percent and 60%
decreases in ESRA and ESRB mRNA levels, respectively, were observed
after treatment with GNRH agonist. Pretreatment of the cells with a
protein kinase C (PKC; see 176960) inhibitor completely reversed the
GNRH agonist-induced downregulation of ESRA and ESRB expression,
suggesting the involvement of PKC in GNRH signal transduction in
granulosa-luteal cells. Chiang et al. (2000) observed a differential
expression of ESRA and ESRB mRNA in granulosa-luteal cells in vitro. The
authors concluded that the demonstration of CG- and GNRH agonist-induced
downregulation of ESRA and ESRB gene expression suggests that CG and
GNRH may contribute to the control of granulosa-luteal cell function.
Furthermore, they inferred that the effects of CG and GNRH on ESRA and
ESRB expression in granulosa-luteal cells are mediated in part by
activation of PKA (see 176911) and PKC signaling pathways, respectively.

Bord et al. (2001) examined the expression of ESR1 and ESR2 in neonatal
human rib bone. ESR1 and ESR2 immunoreactivity was seen in proliferative
and prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, with lower levels
of expression in the late hypertrophic zone. Different patterns of
expression of the 2 estrogen receptors were seen in bone. In cortical
bone, intense staining for ESR1 was observed in osteoblasts and
osteocytes adjacent to the periosteal-forming surface and in osteoclasts
on the opposing resorbing surface. In cancellous bone, ESR2 was strongly
expressed in both osteoblasts and osteocytes, whereas only low
expression of ESR1 was seen in these areas. Nuclear and cytoplasmic
staining for ESR2 was apparent in osteoclasts. The authors concluded
that these observations demonstrate distinct patterns of expression for
the 2 ER subtypes in developing human bone and indicate functions in
both the growth plate and mineralized bone. In the latter, ESR1 is
predominantly expressed in cortical bone, whereas ESR2 shows higher
levels of expression in cancellous bone.

Takeyama et al. (2001) examined the expression and cellular localization
of ESR1 and ESR2 in various human fetal tissues by semiquantitative
RT-PCR (13 and 20 gestational weeks) and immunohistochemistry (13, 20,
and 38 gestational weeks), respectively, to study the possible effects
of estrogens on human fetal tissues during development. Relatively high
levels of ESR2 expression were detected in various human fetal tissues,
whereas those tissues expressing ESR2 had markedly lower levels of ESR1
expression. ESR2 mRNA expression was especially high in the adrenal
gland. ESR2-immunoreactive protein was localized to the definitive zone,
but not in the fetal zone, of the adrenal cortex. Although low levels of
ESR2 mRNA were present in the brain, heart, lung, and kidney, ESR2
immunoreactivity was not detected in these tissues. These results
suggested that the effects of estrogens in these tissues are
predominantly mediated through ESR2. ESR2 immunoreactivity was detected
in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia in the male reproductive tract and in
germ cells in the fetal testis and epididymis. In the female
reproductive tract, both ESR1 and ESR2 were immunopositive in the
epithelium of the oviduct. These results demonstrated the possible sites
for estrogenic action in the human fetus and suggested that the effects
of estrogen via ESR2 may play important roles in human fetal
development, especially in the definitive zone of the adrenal cortex and
in the reproductive tissues of the developing fetus.

The therapeutic effectiveness of selective estrogen receptor modulators
such as tamoxifen and raloxifene in breast cancer depends on their
antiestrogenic activity. In the uterus, however, tamoxifen is
estrogenic. Shang and Brown (2002) showed that both tamoxifen and
raloxifene induce the recruitment of corepressors to target gene
promoters in mammary cells. In endometrial cells, tamoxifen, but not
raloxifene, acts like estrogen by stimulating the recruitment of
coactivators to a subset of genes. The estrogen-like activity of
tamoxifen in the uterus requires a high level of steroid receptor
coactivator-1 (SRC1; 602691) expression. Thus, Shang and Brown (2002)
concluded that cell type- and promoter-specific differences in
coregulator recruitment determine the cellular response to selective
estrogen receptor modulators.

Kumar et al. (2002) identified a naturally occurring short form of MTA1
(603526), which they called MTA1s, that contains a theretofore unknown
sequence of 33 amino acids with an estrogen receptor-binding motif,
leu-arg-ile-leu-leu (LRILL). MTA1s localizes in the cytoplasm,
sequesters estrogen receptor in the cytoplasm, and enhances nongenomic
responses of estrogen receptor. Deletion of the LRILL motif in MTA1s
abolished its corepressor function and its interaction with estrogen
receptor, and restored nuclear localization of estrogen receptor.
Dysregulation of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (ERBB2;
164870) in breast cancer cells enhanced the expression of MTA1s and the
cytoplasmic sequestration of estrogen receptor. Expression of MTA1s in
breast cancer cells prevented ligand-induced nuclear translocation of
estrogen receptor and stimulated malignant phenotypes. MTA1s expression
is increased in human breast tumors with no or low nuclear estrogen
receptor. The regulation of the cellular localization of estrogen
receptor by MTA1s represents a mechanism for redirecting nuclear
receptor signaling by nuclear exclusion.

Auboeuf et al. (2002) examined the impact of transcription mediated by
steroid receptors, including progesterone and estrogen receptors, on RNA
processing using reporter genes subject to alternative splicing driven
by steroid-sensitive promoters. Steroid hormones affected the processing
of pre-mRNA synthesized from steroid-sensitive promoters, but not from
steroid unresponsive promoters, in a steroid receptor-dependent and
receptor-selective manner. Several nuclear receptor coregulators showed
differential splicing effects, suggesting that steroid hormone receptors
may simultaneously control gene transcription activity and exon content
of the product mRNA by recruiting coregulators involved in both
processes.

Flouriot et al. (2000) showed that the 46-kD isoform of ESR1 can
heterodimerize with the 66-kD isoform and can competitively inhibit the
ligand-independent transactivation function of the larger receptor.

Kos et al. (2002) noted that the various ESR1 promoters are utilized in
a tissue-specific manner to control the levels of mRNA variants in
individual tissues. They looked specifically at the effect of upstream
AUGs on the translation of major ESR1 variants. The 5-prime untranslated
region of 1 mRNA species significantly suppressed the translation of a
reporter gene in transient transfection assays. The 5-prime untranslated
region of 3 others showed moderate negative effects. Toeprinting
analysis revealed that leaky scanning occurs with mRNAs bearing the most
inhibitory 5-prime untranslated regions. Kos et al. (2002) concluded
that short upstream open reading frames in the 5-prime untranslated
regions of ESR1 mRNAs can regulate receptor expression.

Reid et al. (2003) established the ubiquitination status and subnuclear
distribution of ESR, its mobility, the kinetics of transcriptional
activation, and the cyclic recruitment of E3 ligases and the 19S
regulatory component of the proteasome. They demonstrated that
proteasome-mediated degradation and ESR-mediated transactivation are
linked and act to turn over ESR continuously on responsive promoters,
and concluded that the cyclic turnover of ESR permits continuous
responses to changes in the concentration of estradiol.

Zhao et al. (2003) noted that the crystal structure of the ER-alpha
ligand-binding domain suggests that leu536 may be involved in
hydrophobic interactions at the start of helix 12. They found that
certain mutations of leu536 increased the ligand-independent activity of
ER-alpha and reduced or eliminated the agonist activity of
17-beta-estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen in a reporter assay. Zhao et
al. (2003) concluded that leu536 is critical in coupling the binding of
ligand to changes in the conformation and transcriptional activity of
ER-alpha. A heterodimer of the dioxin receptor (AHR; 600253) and ARNT
(126110), which are basic helix-loop-helix/PAS family transcription
factors, mediates most of the toxic effects of dioxins.

Li et al. (2003) showed that the ESR46 isoform more efficiently
modulates membrane-initiated estrogen actions, including activation of
eNOS, than full-length ESR66. Conversely, ESR66 more efficiently
mediates estrogen response element reporter-gene transactivation than
ESR46.

Ohtake et al. (2003) demonstrated that the agonist-activated AHR/ARNT
heterodimer directly associates with the estrogen receptors ESR-alpha
and ESR-beta. They showed that this association results in the
recruitment of unliganded estrogen receptor and the coactivator p300
(602700) to estrogen-responsive gene promoters, leading to activation of
transcription and estrogenic effects. The function of liganded estrogen
receptor was found to be attenuated. Estrogenic actions of AHR agonists
were detected in wildtype ovariectomized mouse uteri, but were absent in
Ahr -/- or Er-alpha -/- ovariectomized mice. Ohtake et al. (2003)
concluded that their findings suggest a novel mechanism by which
estrogen receptor-mediated estrogen signaling is modulated by a
coregulatory-like function of activated AHR/ARNT, giving rise to adverse
estrogen-related actions of dioxin-type environmental contaminants.

Garcia-Morales et al. (1994) found that cadmium is a potent stimulator
of the estrogen receptor independent of estradiol. Stoica et al. (2000)
found that cadmium activates ESR1 at concentrations as low as 10(-11) M.
Cadmium was found to block the binding of estradiol to ESR1 in a
noncompetitive manner, suggesting that the heavy metal interacts with
the hormone-binding domain of the receptor. Stoica et al. (2000) showed
that cadmium activates ESR1 through an interaction with the
hormone-binding domain of the receptor. Transfection and binding assays
with ESR1 mutants identified cys381, cys447, glu523, his524, and asp538
as possible interaction sites of cadmium with the hormone-binding domain
of ER-alpha. Johnson et al. (2003) showed that cadmium has a potent
estrogen-like activity in vivo. Female rats were ovariectomized on
postnatal day 28 and allowed to recover for 3 weeks. Rats were then
given a single intraperitoneal dose of cadmium (5 microgram/per kg body
weight or approximately 27 nmol/kg). This exposure to cadmium increased
uterine weight, promoted growth and development of mammary glands, and
induced hormone-regulated genes in ovariectomized animals. In the
uterus, the increase in wet weight was accompanied by proliferation of
the endometrium and induction of progesterone receptor (Pgr; 607311),
and complement component C3 (120700). In the mammary gland, cadmium
promoted an increase in the formation of side branches and alveolar buds
and the induction of casein, whey acidic protein, Pgr, and C3. In utero
exposure to the metal also mimicked the effects of estrogens. Female
offspring experienced an earlier onset of puberty and an increase in the
epithelial area and the number of terminal end buds in the mammary
gland.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, Metivier et al. (2003)
identified protein complexes recruited by ESR1 to the pS2 (TFF1; 113710)
promoter in a breast carcinoma cell line following estradiol treatment,
and they determined the order in which the complexes were recruited.

By immunoprecipitation of human breast cancer cell lines and protein
pull-down assays with in vitro translated proteins, Wada-Hiraike et al.
(2005) demonstrated that ESR1 interacted with MSH2 (609309) in a
ligand-dependent manner, whereas ESR2 (601663) and MSH2 interacted in a
ligand-independent manner. Both receptors bound MSH2 through its MSH3
(600887)/MSH6 (600678)-interaction domain. In a transient expression
assay, MSH2 potentiated the transactivation function of ligand-activated
ESR1 but not ESR2. Wada-Hiraike et al. (2005) concluded that MSH2 may be
a coactivator of ESR1-dependent gene expression.

Wei et al. (2006) found that the MUC1 (158340) C-terminal subunit
associated with ESR1 and that the interaction was stimulated by
17-beta-estradiol in human breast carcinoma cell lines. MUC1 bound
directly to the ESR1 DNA-binding domain and stabilized ESR1 by blocking
its ubiquitination and degradation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
demonstrated that MUC1 associated with ESR1 complexes on
estrogen-responsive promoters, enhanced ESR1 promoter occupancy, and
increased recruitment of p160 (PELP1; 609455) coactivators SRC1 and
GRIP1 (604597). MUC1 stimulated ESR1-mediated transcription and
contributed to estradiol-mediate d growth and survival of breast cancer
cells.

Aguirre et al. (2007) demonstrated that extracellular signal-regulated
kinases (see ERKs, 176948) are not activated by stretching in osteocytic
and osteoblastic cells in which both ESR1 and ESR2 have been knocked out
or knocked down; this effect was partially reversed by transfection of
either of the 2 human ESRs, and fully by transfection of both receptors.
ERK activation in response to stretching was also recovered by
transfecting the ligand-binding domain of either receptor or an ESR1
mutant that does not bind estrogens. Mechanoresponsiveness was restored
by transfecting ESR1 targeted to the plasma membrane but not to the
nucleus, and ESR1 mutants with impaired plasma membrane localization or
binding to caveolin-1 (601047) failed to confer ERK activation in
response to stretching. An ESR antagonist abrogated ERK activation as
well as the antipoptotic effect of mechanical stimulation. Aguirre et
al. (2007) concluded that in addition to their role as ligand-dependent
mediators of the effects of estrogens, the ESRs participate in the
transduction of mechanical forces into prosurvival signaling in bone
cells in a ligand-independent manner.

Perillo et al. (2008) analyzed how H3 histone methylation and
demethylation control expression of estrogen-responsive genes and showed
that a DNA-bound estrogen receptor directs transcription by
participating in bending chromatin to contact the RNA polymerase II (see
180660) recruited to the promoter. This process is driven by
receptor-targeted demethylation of H3K9 (see 602810) at both enhancer
and promoter sites and is achieved by activation of resident LSD1 (AOF2;
609132) demethylase. Localized demethylation produces hydrogen peroxide,
which modifies the surrounding DNA and recruits 8-oxoguanine-DNA
glycosylase-1 (601982) and topoisomerase II-beta (126431), triggering
chromatin and DNA conformational changes that are essential for
estrogen-induced transcription. Perillo et al. (2008) concluded that
their data showed a strategy that uses controlled DNA damage and repair
to guide productive transcription.

Hurtado et al. (2008) showed that estrogen-estrogen receptor (ER) and
tamoxifen-ER complexes directly repress ERBB2 (164870) transcription by
means of a cis-regulatory element within the ERBB2 gene in human cell
lines. Hurtado et al. (2008) implicated the paired box-2 gene product
(PAX2; 167409) in a previously unrecognized role, as a crucial mediator
of ER repression of ERBB2 by the anticancer drug tamoxifen. Hurtado et
al. (2008) showed that PAX2 and the ER coactivator AIB1/SRC3 (601937)
compete for binding and regulation of ERBB2 transcription, the outcome
of which determines tamoxifen response in breast cancer cells. The
repression of ERBB2 by ER-PAX2 links these 2 breast cancer subtypes and
suggests that aggressive ERBB2-positive tumors can originate from
ER-positive luminal tumors by circumventing this repressive mechanism.
Hurtado et al. (2008) concluded that their data provided mechanistic
insight into the molecular basis of endocrine resistance in breast
cancer.

Fullwood et al. (2009) described the development of a new strategy,
which they called chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag
sequencing (ChIA-PET), for the de novo detection of global chromatin
interactions, with which they comprehensively mapped the chromatin
interaction network bound by estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) in the
human genome. Fullwood et al. (2009) found that most high-confidence
remote ER-alpha-binding sites are anchored at gene promoters through
long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that ER-alpha functions by
extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated
transcriptional regulation. Fullwood et al. (2009) proposed that
chromatin interactions constitute a primary mechanism for regulating
transcription in mammalian genomes.

Using breast cancer and other cancer cell lines, Hurtado et al. (2011)
showed that FOXA1 (602294) mediated ER binding and function. Almost all
ER-chromatin interactions and gene expression changes depended on FOXA1,
and FOXA1 influenced genomewide chromatin accessibility. FOXA1 was also
required for the inhibitory activity of tamoxifen against ER.

The classical sex steroid receptors, including ER-alpha, translocate
from the plasma membrane to the nucleus following ligand binding and
influence gene transcription. Sex steroid receptors also engage in cell
signaling at the plasma membrane, and this function requires both ligand
binding and receptor palmitoylation at a conserved cysteine residue.
Palmitoylacyltransferases contain an asp-his-his-cys (DHHC) signature
sequence. By expressing plasmids encoding each mouse DHHC protein in
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, Pedram et al. (2012) found that only
Dhhc7 (614604) and Dhhc21 (614605) functioned in ER-alpha
palmitoylation. Knockdown of endogenous DHHC7 and DHHC21 via small
interfering RNA reduced ER-alpha localization at the plasma membrane and
impaired intracellular signaling by 17-beta-estradiol via ERK (see
176948) and AKT kinases and cAMP generation. Nuclear ER-alpha
localization and transcriptional activation were unaffected. Mutation of
a cysteine in the C-terminal region of mouse ER-alpha abrogated
palmitoylation by Dhhc7 and Dhhc21 and inhibited cell signaling from the
plasma membrane.

Using a constitutively active mutant of the mouse nonreceptor tyrosine
phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11; 176876), He et al. (2012) found that Shp2
integrated leptin (LEP; 164160) and estrogen signaling in transgenic
female mice. Transgenic females, but not males, were resistant to
high-fat diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis via enhanced leptin
and insulin sensitivity and downstream ERK activation. SHP2 and ESR1
interacted directly in MCF-7 cells and female mouse tissues, and the
interaction was enhanced by estrogen stimulation. Ovariectomy of
transgenic mice reversed their resistance to high-fat diet-induced
obesity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Estrogen Resistance

In a 28-year-old man with estrogen resistance (ESTRR; 615363), Smith et
al. (1994) performed single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of
the ESR1 gene and observed a variant banding pattern in exon 2. Direct
sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (R157X; 133430.0002).

McInerney et al. (1996) characterized a human ESR1 variant, V364E
(133430.0003), which they demonstrated to be a strong dominant-negative
inhibitor of wildtype ESR1.

In an 18-year-old woman with estrogen resistance, Quaynor et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the ESR1 gene (Q375H;
133430.0006). Clegg and Palmer (2013) noted that the Esr1 -/AA knockin
mouse model (see ANIMAL MODEL) recapitulates the phenotype of the female
patient studied by Quaynor et al. (2013), in that they have hypoplastic
mammary glands, anovulation, and altered steroidogenesis, but have
normal body weight, adiposity, locomotor activity, and glucose
homeostasis. These findings supported the proposal by Quaynor et al.
(2013) that nonclassical regulation of ESR1 is sufficient to protect
against the obesity-metabolic syndrome phenotype associated with total
loss of activity of ESR1, but is not sufficient to rescue the
infertility phenotype.

- Association with Breast Cancer

Zuppan et al. (1991) reported a lod score of 1.85 for linkage of ESR at
zero recombination with late-onset breast cancer in 1 extended family
with 8 affected members. Simulation of this pedigree assuming
independent inheritance of breast cancer and ESR genotypes led to a lod
score equal to or greater than 1.85 only once in 2,000 replicates.
Zuppan et al. (1991) suggested testing linkage in other breast cancer
families of the late-onset type.

McGuire et al. (1991) used the screening techniques of chemical mismatch
cleavage, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and gel
retardation to discover a number of estrogen receptor mRNA variants in
tissues from breast cancers. They identified basepair insertions,
transitions, and deletions as well as alternative splicing, yielding
deletions of exon 3, 5, or 7. Using a yeast transactivation assay, they
discovered receptors with 'outlaw' function, including both a
dominant-positive receptor which was transcriptionally active in the
absence of estrogen, and a dominant-negative receptor, which was itself
transcriptionally inactive but prevented the action of normal estrogen
receptor. McGuire et al. (1991) concluded that these variants could have
clinical significance, helping to explain differences in the behavior of
breast tumors and patient outcome.

Ponglikitmongkol et al. (1988) found that the ESR isolated from a human
breast cancer cell line contained a gly400-to-val mutation in the
hormone-binding domain. A highly conserved 66-amino acid region of the
estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors, which corresponds to part of the
receptor DNA-binding domain (region C), determines the specificity of
target gene recognition. This region contains 2 subregions (CI and CII),
encoded by 2 separate exons that are analogous to 'zinc fingers.' By the
study of chimeric estrogen receptor, Mader et al. (1989) showed that 3
amino acids located on the C-terminal side of the CI finger play a key
role in the specificity.

It is accepted that the presence of estrogen receptor identifies those
breast cancer patients with a lower risk of relapse and better overall
survival (Clark and McGuire, 1988), and the measurement of ESR has
become a standard assay in the clinical management of breast cancer.
Receptor status also provides a guideline for those tumors that may be
responsive to hormonal intervention. But only about half of ESR-positive
patients respond to various hormonal therapies and of those who do
respond initially, most will eventually develop hormonally unresponsive
disease following a period of treatment even though ESR is often still
present. Sluyser and Mester (1985) hypothesized that the loss of hormone
dependence of certain breast tumors may be due to the presence of
mutated or truncated steroid receptors that activate transcription even
in the absence of hormone. Fuqua et al. (1993) reviewed ESR mutations
that may be important in breast cancer progression. Scott et al. (1991),
for example, had found truncated forms of DNA-binding ESR in human
breast cancer. To better understand structure-activity relationships of
the human estrogen receptor, Weis et al. (1996) examined the role of
tyrosine-537 in transcriptional response of the receptor. This residue
is close to a region of the hormone-binding domain shown previously to
be important in hormone-dependent transcriptional activity; it also has
been proposed to be a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site important in
ESR activity. Weis et al. (1996) substituted 5 amino acids at this
position (alanine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, lysine, or serine) and
screened these mutants for their biologic activities in the presence and
absence of estradiol. Two of the ESR mutants, tyr537 to ala and tyr537
to ser, displayed estrogen-independent constitutive activity that was
approximately 20% or 100%, respectively, of the activity of the wildtype
receptor with estradiol. In some circumstances, the tyr537-to-glu and
tyr537-to-lys proteins also exhibited some low level of constitutive
activity. Their findings indicated that tyrosine-537 is in a region
important in the ligand regulation of ESR transcriptional activity and
that certain amino acid substitutions at this position can shift ESR
into a conformation that is active even without ligand.

Sluyser (1995) reviewed the somatically generated mutations in ESR that
had been found at the mRNA/cDNA level in human breast cancer biopsies
and in established breast cancer cell lines. Aberrantly spliced ESR mRNA
causes the appearance of truncated or internally deleted ESR protein
forms. Studies on the functional activity of ESR variants in expression
systems demonstrated dominant-positive receptors that are
transcriptionally active in the absence of estrogen, and
dominant-negative receptors that are themselves transcriptionally
inactive but that prevent the action of the normal receptor. The ESR
variants are believed to confer resistance to endocrine therapy in
breast cancer patients. Abnormally spliced forms of ESR, similar to
those in breast cancer, were reported by McGuire et al. (1992) and by
others. In all, 19 somatic mutations were tabulated and mapped on a
diagram of the structural organization of the ESR gene.

Andersen et al. (1997) studied leukocyte DNA from 143 patients with
familial clustering of breast and/or ovarian cancer and tumor DNA from
96 breast carcinomas for base mutations in the ESR gene. Three patients
with a family history of cancer were carrying a gly160-to-cys germline
substitution, which they concluded represents a polymorphism because it
was detected in 4 females and 4 males of 729 controls, split about
equally between males and females. However, in the 229 female controls
in whom family history of cancer was known, 1 of 2 who had a sister with
breast cancer was carrying the variant allele; hence, a possible
clinical significance of the gly160-to-cys change should be further
investigated. Somatic mutations were not detected in any of the tumors
studied, and the data did not provide support for somatic ESR base
mutations as an important mechanism for hormonal therapy resistance in
estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas.

Using an Affymetrix 10K SNP array to screen for gene copy number changes
in breast cancer, Holst et al. (2007) detected a single-gene
amplification of the ESR1 gene. A subsequent tissue microarray analysis
of more than 2,000 clinical breast cancer samples showed ESR1
amplification in 20.6% of breast cancers. In 99% of tumors with ESR1
amplification, overexpression of estrogen receptor protein was
demonstrated, compared with 66.6% of cancers without ESR1 amplification.
In 175 women who had received adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy, survival
was significantly longer for women with cancer with ESR1 amplification
than for women with estrogen receptor-expressing cancers without ESR1
amplification (P = 0.023). Notably, they also found ESR1 amplification
in benign and precancerous breast diseases, suggesting that ESR1
amplification may be a common mechanism in proliferative breast disease
and a very early genetic alteration in a large subset of breast cancers.

In correspondences, Brown et al. (2008), Horlings et al. (2008),
Vincent-Salomon et al. (2008), and Reis-Filho et al. (2008) reported
attempts to replicate the finding of Holst et al. (2007) of a high
frequency of ESR1 amplification in breast cancer. No group was able to
replicate the results of Holst et al. (2007), using a variety of methods
including array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), FISH, and
quantitative PCR. Amplification was found at a frequency of
approximately 10% or less (Albertson, 2008). In a discussion of the
findings of all of these groups, Albertson (2008) noted that although
Holst et al. (2007) reported to have followed the standard procedure for
scoring FISH, i.e., to count closely spaced signals as 1 signal, in
their reply to the contesting groups Holst et al. (2008) emphasized the
importance of scoring clusters of signals. Holst et al. (2008) stated,
'In our laboratory, most ESR1-amplified tumors have small gene clusters
that could be considered as one signal if 'ERBB criteria' were
applied....We therefore feel that estimating the ESR1 gene copy number
may--given the currently available reagents--enable a more reliable
identification of amplified cancers than classical counting.' Albertson
(2008) concluded that this and other discrepancies, including that
involving the clinical significance concerning prognosis, indicated that
'the jury is still out on the question of ESR1 amplification and its
clinical significance.'

Certain malignant breast tumors (see 114480) are characterized by a high
prediction uncertainty ('low-confidence') with respect to ESR status.
Kun et al. (2003) analyzed these 'low-confidence' tumors and determined
that their uncertain prediction status arose as a result of widespread
perturbations in multiple genes whose expression is important for
ESR-subtype discrimination. Patients with 'low-confidence' ESR-positive
tumors exhibited a significantly worse overall survival (p = 0.03) and
shorter time to distant metastasis (p = 0.004) compared with their
'high-confidence' ESR-positive counterparts. Elevated expression of
ERBB2 (164870) was significantly correlated with a breast tumor
exhibiting a 'low-confidence' prediction. Although ERBB2 signaling has
been proposed to inhibit the transcriptional activity of ESR1, a large
proportion of the perturbed genes in the 'low-confidence'/ERBB2-positive
samples are not known to be estrogen responsive. Kun et al. (2003)
proposed that a significant portion of the effect of ERBB2 on
ESR-positive breast tumors may involve ESR-independent mechanisms of
gene activation, which may contribute to the clinically aggressive
behavior of the 'low-confidence' breast tumor subtype.

- Association with Bone Mineral Density Variation

Lorentzon et al. (1999) investigated the influence of ESRA gene
polymorphism and estradiol on height and bone density during and after
puberty in males. Using the restriction enzymes XbaI and PvuII, the
allelic variants XX, Xx, xx, PP, Pp, and pp were identified in 90
Caucasian boys. In a multivariate analysis including pubertal
development, physical activity, and body weight, the XbaI genotype
independently predicted total body BMD, head BMD, and spine volumetric
BMD (P less than 0.05). The PvuII genotype independently predicted spine
volumetric BMD (pp greater than PP; P of 0.01). The 20 boys with the PP
allelic variant were found to have a greater body height than the other
70 boys (182 cm vs 179 cm; P of 0.03). At a 2-year follow-up, the XbaI
genotype was still independently related to total body BMD, head BMD,
and spine volumetric BMD. The authors concluded that ESRA polymorphism
is related to bone density and height during late puberty and at
attainment of peak bone density in young men.

Bone mineral density, the major determinant of osteoporotic fracture
risk, has a strong genetic component. The discovery that inactivation of
ESR1 is associated with low BMD indicated ESR1 as a candidate gene for
osteoporosis (166710). Becherini et al. (2000) genotyped 610
postmenopausal women for 3 ESR1 gene polymorphisms (intron 1 RFLPs PvuII
and XbaI, and a (TA)n repeat 5-prime upstream of exon 1). Although no
significant relationship between intron 1 RFLPs and BMD was observed, a
statistically significant correlation between (TA)n-repeat allelic
variants and lumbar BMD was observed (P = 0.04, ANCOVA), with subjects
having a low number of repeats (TA less than 15) showing the lowest BMD
values. The authors observed a statistically significant difference in
the mean +/- SD number of (TA)n repeats between 73 analyzed women with a
vertebral fracture and the nonfracture group, equivalent to a 2.9-fold
increased fracture risk in women with a low number of repeats. The
authors concluded that in their large sample the (TA)n polymorphism in
ESR1 accounts for part of the heritable component of BMD and may prove
useful in the prediction of vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal
osteoporosis.

Colin et al. (2003) studied the combined influence of polymorphisms in
the ESR1 and the VDR (601769) genes on the susceptibility to
osteoporotic vertebral fractures in 634 women aged 55 years and older.
Three VDR haplotypes (1, 2, and 3) of the BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI
restriction fragment length polymorphisms and 3 ESR1 haplotypes (1, 2,
and 3) of the PvuII and XbaI RFLPs were identified. ESR1 haplotype 1 was
dose-dependently associated with increased vertebral fracture risk
corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-4.1)
per copy of the risk allele. VDR haplotype 1 was overrepresented in
vertebral fracture cases. There was a significant interaction (P = 0.01)
between ESR1 haplotype 1 and VDR haplotype 1 in determining vertebral
fracture risk. The association of ESR1 haplotype 1 with vertebral
fracture risk was present only in homozygous carriers of VDR haplotype
1. The risk of fracture was 2.5 for heterozygous and 10.3 for homozygous
carriers of ESR1 haplotype 1. These associations were independent of
BMD. The authors concluded that interaction between ESR1 and VDR gene
polymorphisms leads to increased risk of osteoporotic vertebral
fractures in women, largely independent of BMD.

Van Meurs et al. (2003) investigated the influence of genetic variation
in ESR1 on several bone parameters in 2,042 individuals of the Rotterdam
Study, a prospective population-based cohort study of elderly
individuals. They analyzed 3 polymorphic sites in the 5-prime region of
the ESR1 gene: a (TA)n repeat in the promoter region, molecular
haplotypes of the PvuII and XbaI RFLPs in intron 1, and inferred
long-range haplotypes thereof. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis
between the PvuII-XbaI haplotype and the (TA)n repeat showed strong LD
between the 2 sites. Reconstruction of long-range haplotypes over the
entire 5-prime region revealed 6 frequent long-range haplotypes. In
women only, there was an allele dosage effect of haplotype 'px' (p =
0.003) and a low number of (TA)n repeats (p = 0.008) with decreased
lumbar spine BMD and decreased vertebral bone area (p = 0.016). There
was also an increased vertebral fracture risk with evidence for an
allele dosage effect with an odds ratio of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.3-3.5) for
haplotype 'px' and an odds ratio of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.5-3.2) for a low
number of (TA)n repeats. The ESR1 genotype-dependent fracture risk was
largely independent of BMD and bone area. Van Meurs et al. (2003)
concluded that ESR1 polymorphisms in the 5-prime promoter region are
associated with vertebral fracture risk, lumbar spine BMD, and vertebral
bone area in postmenopausal women, but not in men.

Khosla et al. (2004) studied relationships between polymorphisms of the
ESRA and ESRB genes, BMD, and rates of bone loss in an age-stratified
random sample of 283 Rochester, Minnesota, men aged 22 to 90 years. DNA
was analyzed for the XbaI and PvuII ESRA and AluI ESRB polymorphisms.
The X/P and x/p alleles of the ESRA gene were in strong linkage
disequilibrium. BMD at multiple sites did not differ as a function of
either the ESRA or ESRB genotype. However, the ESRA (but not ESRB)
genotypes did modulate the relationship between BMD or rates of bone
loss and bioavailable estradiol levels in these men. The authors
concluded that the ESRA genotype may modulate the relationship between
BMD or rates of bone loss and estrogen levels in men and that bone mass
in men with the X or P alleles may be more susceptible to the
consequences of estrogen deficiency (and conversely, benefit most from
estrogen sufficiency) than in men with the xx or pp genotypes.

Sowers et al. (2004) conducted a 10-year prospective study of peak bone
mass and its change in 604 women, aged 24 to 44 years at study
initiation, and related changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and
osteocalcin (OCN; 112260) concentrations to ESR1 gene polymorphisms (the
XbaI and PvuII RFLPs) in 442 of these women. The authors concluded that
while ESR1 genotype associations were statistically significant in
explaining the rate of perimenopausal bone loss and its turnover,
baseline BMI or becoming postmenopausal contributed more to the
magnitude of the difference in bone change.

In 945 postmenopausal Scottish women who had not received hormone
replacement therapy (non-HRT), Albagha et al. (2005) found that annual
rates of femoral neck bone loss were 14% higher in subjects who carried
1 copy of the 'px' allele and 22% higher in those who carried 2 copies
compared to those who did not carry the px haplotype (p = 0.009). The px
haplotype was associated with lower femoral neck BMD in non-HRT
postmenopausal women (p = 0.02), and with reduced calcaneal broadband
ultrasound attenuation in the whole study population of 3,054 Scottish
women (p = 0.005). Albagha et al. (2005) concluded that the ESR1 px
haplotype is associated with reduced femoral neck BMD and increased
rates of femoral neck bone loss in non-HRT postmenopausal women, and
suggested that the association with broadband ultrasound attenuation may
explain the fact that ESR1 intron 1 alleles predict osteoporotic
fractures by a mechanism partly independent of differences in BMD.

Tobias et al. (2007) investigated whether the gain in area-adjusted bone
mineral content (ABMC) in girls occurs in late puberty and examined
whether the magnitude of this gain is related to ESR1 polymorphisms. For
dbSNP rs2234693 (PvuII) and dbSNP rs9340799 (XbaI) polymorphisms,
differences in spinal ABMC in late puberty were 2-fold greater in girls
who were homozygous for the C and G alleles, respectively (P = 0.001).
For dbSNP rs7757956, the difference in total body less head ABMC in late
puberty was 50% less in individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the A
allele (P = 0.006). Tobias et al. (2007) concluded that gains in ABMC in
late pubertal girls are strongly associated with ESR1 polymorphisms,
suggesting that estrogen contributes to this process via an estrogen
receptor-alpha-dependent pathway.

In a case-control study of 70 osteoporotic Mexican women and 70
nonosteoporotic female controls, Gomez et al. (2007) analyzed the (TA)n
repeat and 2014G-A polymorphisms of the ESR1 gene and found that, with
correction for population stratification, the 2014G allele was
associated with osteoporosis (OR, 4.34; p = 0.006) in the Mexican
population, whereas the TA repeat polymorphism was not.

In a genomewide association study to find common sequence variants that
influence bone mineral density and low-trauma fractures in 3 populations
of European descent, Styrkarsdottir et al. (2008) identified a complex
pattern of association in the 6q25 region (see BMND11, 612114). SNPs in
this region showed an association with BMD of both hip and spine,
although no single SNP could fully explain the association. At least 3
SNPs were required to account for the overall association; one of these
was in an intron of an ESR1 splice variant, and the other 2 were in the
nearby C6ORF97 gene.

- Association with Myocardial Infarction or Cardiovascular
Risk Factors

In a study of 309 postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease,
Herrington et al. (2002) found that women who were of a particular
genotype at the ESR1 locus had an augmented response of HDL cholesterol
to hormone replacement therapy (see 133430.0004).

In a study of 2,617 men and 3,791 postmenopausal women, aged 55 years
and older, followed up over a period of 7 years or more, Schuit et al.
(2004) found that postmenopausal women who carried the ESR1 haplotype 1
had an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI; 608446) and ischemic
heart disease, independent of known cardiovascular risk factors. In men,
no association was observed. Haplotype 1 is comprise of 2 polymorphisms
located in the first intron of the ESR1 gene, 397 bp (PvuII; dbSNP
rs2234693) and 351 bp (XbaI; dbSNP rs9340799) upstream of exon 2.

Taguchi (2004) raised the question of whether the connection between
ESR1 and MI might not be direct. Since Mattila et al. (1989) reported an
association between poor dental health and acute MI in men, several
studies had shown such an association in women as well (Emingil et al.,
2000); Taguchi et al. (2001) reported a significant association between
ESR1 polymorphisms and tooth loss in postmenopausal women. Thus, the
association between ESR1 polymorphisms and MI in postmenopausal women
could actually be due to an association between ESR1 polymorphisms and
tooth loss. Another possibility that Taguchi (2004) raised was that
endothelial dysfunction that may lead to MI contributes to periodontitis
and subsequent tooth loss in postmenopausal women. A third possibility
was that the association between ESR1 polymorphisms and tooth loss and
between ESR1 polymorphisms and MI are both real, so that the association
between tooth loss and MI in postmenopausal women in previous studies is
spurious and actually due to the ESR1 polymorphisms.

Shearman et al. (2005) tested for interaction between smoking and ESR1
variation in association with plasma concentration of atherogenic small,
low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and LDL particle size. Among
1,727 unrelated subjects from the population-based Framingham Heart
Study, women who smoked and had the common ESR1 dbSNP rs2234693 TT
genotype had more than 1.7-fold higher levels of small LDL particles
than women with the alternative genotypes (P-value for smoking-genotype
interaction = 0.001). Similar results were obtained for 3 other ESR1
variants including dbSNP rs9340799, in the same linkage disequilibrium
block. A similar substantial gender-specific result was also evident
with a 975C-G variant, in a separate linkage disequilibrium block, in
exon 4 (P = 0.003). Women who smoked and had specific, common ESR1
genotypes had a substantially higher plasma concentration of atherogenic
small LDL particles. Significant results revealed a dose-dependent
effect of smoking and were evident in both pre- and postmenopausal
women. The reported association has the potential to explain the risks
associated with estrogen use in certain women and an association between
the ESR1 haplotype 1 (dbSNP rs2234693 T allele and dbSNP rs9340799 A
allele) with increased MI and ischemic heart disease, independent of the
standard, established cardiovascular risk factors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Korach (1994) investigated hormone responsiveness in genetic mutant mice
without a functional estrogen receptor, created through gene knockout
techniques. Both sexes of these mutant animals were infertile and showed
a variety of phenotypic changes associated with the gonads, mammary
glands, reproductive tracts, and skeletal tissues.

To clarify the role of estrogen signaling in reproductive tract
development and function, Couse et al. (1999) generated mice lacking
ESRA and ESRB by targeted disruption. ESRA/ESRB knockout males were
infertile but possessed a grossly normal reproductive tract. They
exhibited various stages of spermatogenesis, but the numbers and
motility of epididymal sperm were reduced significantly. ESRA/ESRB
knockout females exhibited proper differentiation of the
mullerian-derived structures of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina,
but these structures were severely hypoplastic in adults. Similar
uterine hypoplasia was observed in ESRA, but not in ESRB, knockout mice.
The ovaries of adult ESRA/ESRB knockout females exhibited morphologic
phenotypes that were clearly distinct from those of the prepubertal
ESRA/ESRB knockout females and the individual estrogen receptor knockout
mice. The double-knockout female ovaries had structures resembling
seminiferous tubules of the testis. Within the lumen of the tubule-like
structures were degenerating granulosa cells and cells resembling
Sertoli cells of the testis. Couse et al. (1999) argued that certain
characteristics of the adult ESRA/ESRB knockout ovary indicated
redifferentiation of varying components rather than a developmental
phenomenon: the absence of similar structures in prepubertal ESRA/ESRB
knockout ovaries; the consistent spherical shape of the tubules,
suggesting origination from a once healthy follicle; and age-related
increases in the area of transdifferentiation. The ovaries of adult
ESRA/ESRB knockout females expressed mullerian-inhibiting substance
(600957), sulfated glycoprotein-2 (185430), and Sox9 (608160). Couse et
al. (1999) concluded that the loss of both receptors leads to an ovarian
phenotype that is distinct from that of the individual estrogen receptor
knockout mutants, which indicates that both receptors are required for
the maintenance of germ and somatic cells in the postnatal ovary.

Heine et al. (2000) found that male and female Esr1 knockout mice had
hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes, insulin resistance, and
glucose intolerance. The results provided evidence that estrogen/ESR1
signaling is critical in female and male white adipose tissue; obesity
in the knockout males involved a mechanism of reduced energy expenditure
rather than increased energy intake. Similar results were obtained by
Jones et al. (2000) studying aromatase (CYP19; 107910) knockout mice,
which cannot synthesize endogenous estrogens. Both male and female
aromatase knockout mice progressively accumulated significantly more
intraabdominal adipose tissue than their wildtype littermates and had
elevated circulating levels of leptin and cholesterol, as well as
elevated insulin levels and a striking accumulation of lipid droplets in
the livers.

Davis et al. (2002) noted that studies in humans and rodent models had
suggested that estrogen may provide protection against age-related
cataracts. The presence of estrogen receptors in the eye indicates that
estrogen protection may result from direct interactions with its
receptors in the eye, instead of being an indirect consequence from
effects on another tissue. Davis et al. (2002) validated the concept
that estrogen is beneficial for the eye. In transgenic mice expressing
ESR-delta-3, a natural variant of ESR1 with an in-frame deletion of exon
3 resulting from alternative splicing, they found that cortical
cataracts spontaneously formed in females after puberty and progressed
with age. ESR-delta-3 is a dominant-negative form of ESR-alpha that
inhibits ESR-alpha function. Cataract formation could be prevented if
the females were ovariectomized before, but not after, sexual maturity.
Both male and female ESR-delta-3 mice developed cataracts after neonatal
treatment with the potent estrogen DES. The incidence of spontaneous and
DES-induced cataracts in ESR-delta-3 mice was 100%, whereas such
cataracts were absent from wildtype mice. The data suggested that
repression of estrogen action induces cortical cataract formation
because estrogen is required to activate the ESR-delta-3 repressor.
Evidence of DES-induced cataracts in the ESR-delta-3 males as well as
the females suggested that estrogen is important in lens physiology in
both sexes.

Using mice lacking functional Esr1, Lee et al. (2003) showed that bone
in vivo undergoes an adaptive response to loading that is less effective
in the absence of Esr1 and that osteoblast-like cells require Esr1 to
proliferate in response to mechanical strain in vitro. Lee et al. (2003)
speculated that as ESR1 expression in osteoblasts and osteocytes depends
on estrogen concentration, a failure to maintain bone strength after
menopause might be due to reduction in the activity of ESR1 in bone
cells, thereby limiting their anabolic response to mechanical loading
and allowing a loss of bone tissue comparable to that associated with
disuse.

Garey et al. (2003) identified a generalized arousal component in the
behavior of mice. Analyzed by mathematical/statistical approaches across
experiments, investigators, and mouse populations, it accounted for
approximately one-third of the variance in arousal-related measures.
Knockout of the Esr1 gene greatly reduced arousal responses. In
contrast, disrupting the Esr2 gene (601663), a likely gene duplication
product which encodes ER-beta, did not have these effects.

In mice, ovariectomy accelerates the progression of the end-stage renal
disease glomerulosclerosis. In women, the incidence of this disorder
increases after menopause, and estrogen alters its progression.
Polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene may constitute a genetic predisposition
for lupus nephritis (Liu et al., 2002). Shim et al. (2004) showed that
by 1 year of age, mice lacking ER-alpha, but not those lacking ER-beta,
exhibited immune complex-type glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, and
destruction of tubular cells. The mice also showed spontaneous formation
of germinal centers in the spleen in the absence of antigen challenge
and infiltration of plasma cells in the kidney and spleen. The results
indicated that ER-alpha has indispensable functions in the kidney and in
germinal centers, and that defective ER-alpha signaling results in
glomerulonephritis.

In female mice and rats, Musatov et al. (2007) used RNAi to focally
silence ER-alpha in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and
observed development of a phenotype characteristic of metabolic
syndrome, marked by obesity, hyperphagia, impaired glucose tolerance,
and reduced energy expenditure; this phenotype persisted despite normal
ER-alpha levels elsewhere in the brain. Although an increase in food
intake preceded weight gain, the authors stated that their data
suggested that a leading factor of obesity in this model was likely a
decline in energy expenditure with all 3 major constituents being
affected, including voluntary activity, basal metabolic rate, and
diet-induced thermogenesis. Musatov et al. (2007) concluded that
ER-alpha in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus neurons plays
an essential role in the control of energy balance and maintenance of
normal body weight.

Nakamura et al. (2007) selectively ablated Esr1 in differentiated mouse
osteoclasts and found that females, but not males, exhibited trabecular
bone loss, similar to the osteoporotic bone phenotype in postmenopausal
women. Furthermore, estrogen induced apoptosis and upregulation of Fas
ligand (FASL, or TNFSF6; 134638) in osteoclasts of trabecular bones of
wildtype mice, but not mutant mice. Expression of Esr1 was also required
for induction of apoptosis by tamoxifen and estrogen in cultured
osteoclasts. Nakamura et al. (2007) concluded that estrogen regulates
the life span of mature osteoclasts via induction of the FAS (TNFRSF6;
134637)/FASL system.

To examine the ability of estrogen response element (ERE)-independent
ESR1 signaling pathways to convey estrogen feedback regulation of the
female hypothalamic-pituitary axis, Glidewell-Kenney et al. (2007) bred
knockin mice expressing a mutant form of Esr1 ('AA') that has ablated
ERE activity but intact ERE-independent activity with Esr1 -/- mice. The
Esr1 -/AA mice exhibited 70% lower serum LH levels compared to Esr1 -/-
mice. In addition, like wildtype mice, Esr1 -/AA mice exhibited elevated
LH after ovariectomy, and the postovariectomy rise in LH was
significantly suppressed by estrogen treatment in the ovariectomized
Esr1 -/AA mice. However, unlike wildtype, both Esr1 -/AA and Esr1 -/-
mice failed to exhibit estrous cyclicity, spontaneous ovulation, or an
afternoon LH surge response to estrogen. Glidewell-Kenney et al. (2007)
concluded that ERE-independent ESR1 signaling is sufficient to convey
the majority of estrogen's negative feedback actions, whereas positive
feedback and spontaneous ovulatory cyclicity require ERE-dependent ESR1
signaling.

Park et al. (2011) used Esr1 -/AA mice to assess the role of
noncanonical ESR1 signaling in energy homeostasis and found that
nonclassical ESR1 signaling restored metabolic parameters dysregulated
in Esr1 -/- mice to normal or near-normal values. The rescue of body
weight and metabolic function by nonclassical ESR1 signaling was
mediated by normalization of energy expenditure, including voluntary
locomotor activity. Park et al. (2011) concluded that nonclassical ESR1
signaling mediates major effects of estradiol-17-beta on energy balance.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ESTROGEN RECEPTOR MUTANT, TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE
ESR1, CYS447ALA

Reese and Katzenellenbogen (1991) identified an estrogen receptor mutant
that had a similar binding affinity for estradiol as wildtype ESR but
displayed a dose-response shift for estradiol in transactivation
studies. The mutant contained an alanine substitution for cysteine at
amino acid 447 in the hormone binding domain of the receptor. Reese and
Katzenellenbogen (1992) showed by hormone binding studies that the C447A
receptor is a temperature-sensitive mutant, whose instability is only
apparent at elevated temperatures, and that ligand can stabilize the
mutant receptor. The mutant also showed a temperature-sensitive loss in
the DNA binding ability of the receptor. (The mutant was one of several
created by Reese and Katzenellenbogen (1991) by in vitro oligonucleotide
site-directed mutagenesis of human ESR cDNA. Function of the mutant
forms was tested in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, an estrogen
receptor-deficient cell line.)

.0002
ESTROGEN RESISTANCE
ESR1, ARG157TER

In a 28-year-old man with estrogen resistance (ESTRR; 615363), Smith et
al. (1994) identified homozygosity for a C-T transition in exon 2 of the
ESR1 gene, resulting in an arg157-to-ter (R157X) substitution. Both
parents were heterozygous carriers of the R157X mutation, and pedigree
analysis showed that they were related as second cousins; 3 sisters were
also heterozygous for the mutation.

.0003
ESTROGEN RESISTANCE
ESR1, VAL364GLU

McInerney et al. (1996) characterized a human ESR mutant, val364 to glu,
which has a single amino acid substitution in its hormone-binding
domain. While this mutant is fully active or even superactive at
saturating levels of estradiol it also acts as a strong
dominant-negative inhibitor of the wildtype ESR and it is able to
repress ESR-mediated transcription when the mutant and wildtype ESR are
present together in cells, even without DNA binding. It is probable that
altered interactions with proteins important in ESR-mediated
transcription play a key role in the repression of transcription by
val364 to glu.

.0004
HDL CHOLESTEROL, AUGMENTED RESPONSE OF, TO HORMONE REPLACEMENT
ATHEROSCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED;;
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
ESR1, IVS1, T-C, -401

Herrington et al. (2002) characterized 309 women with coronary artery
disease with respect to 8 previously described and 2 novel ESR1
polymorphisms, and examined the association between these polymorphisms
and the response of HDL cholesterol and other lipids to treatment with
estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin. They found that
postmenopausal women who had the ESR1 C/C genotype at the -401 position
in intron 1, or several other closely related genotypes, had an
augmented response of HDL cholesterol to hormone replacement therapy.

Lehtimaki et al. (2002) examined coronary artery specimens from 300
Finnish white men aged 33 to 69 years included in the Helsinki Sudden
Death Study and determined the ESR1 IVS1 -401T/C (or PvuII) genotype.
After adjusting for age and BMI, men aged 53 years or over with C/T and
C/C genotypes had areas of complicated lesions on average 2- and 5-fold
larger, respectively, than subjects with the T/T genotype. The age and
BMI-adjusted odds ratios for coronary thrombosis were 6.2 for C/T and
10.6 for C/C compared to men with the T/T genotype. After additional
adjustment for diabetes and hypertension, ESR1 genotype persisted as an
independent predictor of complicated lesions and coronary thrombosis.
Lehtimaki et al. (2002) concluded that the ESR1 gene is a potential
candidate behind the pathogenesis of acute coronary events.

In a study of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in 1,739 unrelated
men and women from the Framingham Heart Study, Shearman et al. (2003)
found that after adjustment for covariates, the ESR1 C/C genotype was
significantly associated with major atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease and myocardial infarction (608446) (odds ratios of 2.0 and 3.0,
respectively, compared to individuals with the C/T or T/T genotypes).
The results remained significant when analyses were restricted to men;
too few women had events to study them separately. Shearman et al.
(2003) concluded that individuals with the common ESR1 C/C genotype have
a substantial increase in risk of myocardial infarction.

.0005
MIGRAINE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ESR1, 594G-A

Migraine (157300) is a painful and debilitating disorder with a
significant genetic component. Steroid hormones, in particular estrogen,
have long been considered to play a role in migraine, as variations in
hormone levels are associated with migraine onset in many individuals
with the disorder. Steroid hormones mediate their activity via hormone
receptors, which have a wide tissue distribution. Estrogen receptors
have been localized to the brain in regions considered to be involved in
migraine pathogenesis. Colson et al. (2004) examined the ESR1 gene for a
potential role in migraine pathogenesis and susceptibility. A
population-based cohort of 224 patients with migraine and 224 matched
controls were genotyped for the 594G-A polymorphism located in exon 8 of
the ESR1 gene. Statistical analysis indicated a significant difference
between patients with migraine and those without migraine in both the
allele frequencies (P = 0.003) and genotype distributions (P = 0.008).
An independent follow-up study using this marker in an additional
population-based cohort of 260 patients with migraine and 260 matched
controls resulted in a significant association between the 2 groups with
regard to allele frequencies and genotype distributions. The findings
supported the hypothesis that genetic variation in hormone receptors, in
particular the ESR1 gene, may play a role in migraines.

.0006
ESTROGEN RESISTANCE
ESR1, GLN375HIS

In an 18-year-old woman with estrogen resistance (615363), Quaynor et
al. (2013) identified homozygosity for a c.1125G-T transversion in exon
5 of the ESR1 gene, resulting in a gln375-to-his (Q375H) substitution at
a highly conserved residue within the ligand-binding domain. The patient
had been adopted, thus DNA was not available from her parents; however,
high-density microarray analysis revealed an approximately 11% region of
homozygosity, suggesting that her biologic parents were second-degree
relatives and likely heterozygous carriers of the mutation. Functional
analysis in transfected COS-7 cells showed greatly reduced activity in
the mutated estrogen receptor, with an EC50 that was 240-fold greater
than that of the wildtype receptor.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NALPs are cytoplasmic proteins that form a subfamily within the larger
CATERPILLER protein family. Most short NALPs, such as NALP12, have an
N-terminal pyrin (MEFV; 608107) domain (PYD), followed by a NACHT
domain, a NACHT-associated domain (NAD), and a C-terminal leucine-rich
repeat (LRR) region. The long NALP, NALP1 (606636), also has a
C-terminal extension containing a function to find domain (FIIND) and a
caspase recruitment domain (CARD). NALPs are implicated in the
activation of proinflammatory caspases (e.g., CASP1; 147678) via their
involvement in multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes (Tschopp et
al., 2003).

CLONING

Using representational difference analysis with a nitric oxide-treated
leukemia cell line, Shami et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding NALP12,
which they termed RNO. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
3.0-kb transcript in polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes.

By searching databases for PYPAF homologs, Wang et al. (2002) identified
NALP12, which they called PYPAF7. The predicted 1,061-amino acid protein
has an N-terminal PYRIN domain, a central NACHT-type nucleotide-binding
site domain, and a C-terminal domain with at least 12 LRR motifs.
Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed expression in peripheral
blood leukocytes, with little to no expression in 75 other tissues and
cell lines examined. Real-time PCR detected expression predominantly in
eosinophils and granulocytes, with lower expression in monocytes.

By searching for genes with homology to CIITA (MHC2TA; 600005), followed
by RT-PCR and RACE using monocyte cell line cDNA, Williams et al. (2003)
obtained a cDNA encoding NALP12, which they called monarch-1. The
full-length 1,063-amino acid monarch-1 protein is identical to PYPAF7
(Wang et al., 2002) except that it has an additional arg at position
692. Williams et al. (2003) also identified monarch-1 splice variants
lacking 9 (isoform II), exons 7 and 8 (isoform III), and exons 7 through
9 (isoform IV).

GENE FUNCTION

Using coexpression studies, Wang et al. (2002) found that PYPAF7
associated with ASC (PYCARD; 606838) in a PYD-dependent manner.
Immunoblot and luciferase reporter analyses showed that ASC and PYPAF7
synergistically participated in activation of NFKB (see 164011) and
procaspase-1. Wang et al. (2002) concluded that PYPAF7 has a role in the
transduction of proinflammatory signals leading to activation of NFKB
and procaspase-1.

By microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses following expression of
monarch-1 in nonexpressing cell lines, Williams et al. (2003) found that
monarch-1 upregulated classical and nonclassical MHC I genes, as well as
LMP7 (PSMB8; 177046). TNF (191160) and IFNG (147570), which upregulate
MHC expression, downregulated monarch-1 expression, suggesting that
monarch-1 may represent a separate pathway for MHC I induction.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2002) mapped the NALP12 gene
to chromosome 19q13.4 in close proximity to most other NALP genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome-2 (FCAS2; 611762), Jeru et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for mutation in the NLRP12 gene (609648.0001
and 609648.0002, respectively). The findings indicated a dominant mode
of expression through haploinsufficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FAMILIAL COLD AUTOINFLAMMATORY SYNDROME 2
NLRP12, ARG284TER

In a father and his twin sons with cold autoinflammatory syndrome-2
(FCAS2; 611762), Jeru et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 850C-T
transition in exon 3 of the NLRP12 gene, resulting in an arg284-to-ter
(R284X) substitution within the nucleotide binding site of the protein.
The family was from Guadeloupe. The phenotype included episodic fever,
arthralgia, myalgia, and urticaria triggered by cold exposure. Both sons
had sensorineural hearing loss. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant NLRP12 had reduced inhibitory action against
NF-kappa-B (164011) compared to wildtype NLRP12.

.0002
FAMILIAL COLD AUTOINFLAMMATORY SYNDROME 2
NLRP12, IVS3DS, 1-BP INS, +3T

In a father and daughter from Guadeloupe with cold autoinflammatory
syndrome-2 (FCAS2; 611762), Jeru et al. (2008) identified a 1-bp
insertion (2072+3insT) within the donor splice site of intron 3,
resulting in a frameshift and premature protein truncation. The daughter
had the more severe phenotype, characterized by episodic fever,
abdominal pain, buccal aphthous ulcers, and arthralgia triggered by
cold. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant
NLRP12 had reduced inhibitory action against NF-kappa-B (164011)
compared to wildtype NLRP12.

602725	TITLE *602725 INTERFERON-RELATED DEVELOPMENTAL REGULATOR 2; IFRD2
;;INTERFERON-RELATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While analyzing a region from 3p21.3 that has been shown to undergo
overlapping homozygous deletions in several small cell lung cancer
(SCLC) cell lines, Latif et al. (1997) identified cDNAs representing a
novel gene, named SKMc15 by them. SKMc15 was homozygously deleted in 3
of 63 SCLC cell lines. Northern blot analysis showed that SKMc15 was
expressed as a 1.8- to 2.0-kb mRNA in all analyzed fetal and adult
tissues and in most lung tumor cell lines. Latif et al. (1997) reported
that the sequence of the 442-amino acid SKMc15 protein is 83% similar to
a partial sequence of the putative mouse interferon beta-2 (147620)
protein. The SKMc15 protein also shows 75% similarity to the rat early
response gene PC4 and its murine homolog, TIS7.

Lerman and Minna (2000) noted that IFRD2 is a soluble nuclear protein
that is 93% identical to the mouse protein. It contains a predicted
bipartite nuclear localization signal and an armadillo-beta catenin
(CTNNB1; 116806)-like repeat. No mutations were detected in any lung
cancer cell lines tested. Lerman and Minna (2000) concluded that HYAL3
is an unlikely candidate tumor suppressor gene, given the lack of
detected mutations and its expression pattern.

GENE STRUCTURE

Latif et al. (1997) determined that the SKMc15 gene contains 11 exons
and spans 7 to 10 kb. By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna
(2000) determined that the IRFD2 gene contains 12 exons and spans 6 kb.

MAPPING

Latif et al. (1997) mapped the SKMc15 gene to chromosome 3p21.3.

;;SLIL2;;
MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 5; MEGF5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In Drosophila embryogenesis, the 'slit' gene has been shown to play a
critical role in central nervous system midline formation. Itoh et al.
(1998) cloned SLIT3, a human homolog of the Drosophila 'slit' gene. They
also cloned 2 additional human 'slit' homologs, which they termed SLIT1
(603742) and SLIT2 (603746), as well as the rat homolog, Slit1. Each
SLIT gene encodes a putative secreted protein, which contains conserved
protein-protein interaction domains including leucine-rich repeats and
epidermal growth factor-like (see 131530) motifs, similar to those of
the Drosophila protein. The SLIT3 cDNA encodes a 1,523-amino acid
polypeptide with 41.1% similarity to the Drosophila 'slit' protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the human SLIT3 gene was expressed
as a major 5.5- and a minor 9.5-kb transcript primarily in the thyroid.
SLIT1 and SLIT2 mRNAs were primarily expressed in the brain and spinal
cord, respectively. In situ hybridization studies indicated that the rat
Slit1 mRNA was specifically expressed in the neurons of fetal and adult
forebrains. These data suggested that the SLIT genes form an
evolutionarily conserved group in vertebrates and invertebrates, and
that the mammalian SLIT proteins may participate in the formation and
maintenance of the nervous and endocrine systems by protein-protein
interactions.

Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, Zhang et al. (2009) found that SLIT3 was
highly expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and
in primary endothelial cells isolated from mouse lung and diaphragm, but
not liver. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Slit3 expression in
endothelial cells of adult mouse lung and brain. Endothelial Slit3
expression was lower in mouse kidney and absent in mouse liver and
heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Using ELISA, Zhang et al. (2009) showed that SLIT3 was secreted from
HUVECs, mouse lung endothelial cells, and rat vascular smooth muscle
cells and that it interacted with the SLIT receptors ROBO1 (602430) and
ROBO4 (607528). The isolated leucine-rich repeat region of mouse Slit3
showed mitogenic activity toward HUVECs and mouse endothelial cells and
promoted endothelial cell motility and migration. Antibodies directed
against ROBO4, but not ROBO1, blocked Slit3 biologic activity. Slit3
elicited a rapid ROBO4-dependent activation of RAC1 (602048) and RHOA
(165390), but not CDC42 (116952). Slit3 also elicited vascular
morphogenesis of HUVECs in 3-dimensional gels, microvessel sprouting in
a rat aortic ring assay, and angiogenesis in a mouse corneal
angiogenesis assay. Zhang et al. (2009) concluded that SLIT3 functions
as a proangiogenic factor.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of radiation hybrid panels, Nakayama et al. (1998)
mapped the SLIT3 gene, which they referred to as the MEGF5 gene, to
chromosome 5q35.

ANIMAL MODEL

Central congenital diaphragmatic hernia (see 222400) occurs in the
midline of the septum transversum and accounts for 1 to 2% of the total
cases of CDH. The pathologic consequences of CDH result from the
abdominal contents entering the thoracic cavity. Hypoplasia of the lung
due to decreased thoracic volume compromises pulmonary capacity and
often results in neonatal death. In contrast to SLIT1 and SLIT2, which
are expressed prominently in the CNS, SLIT3 is expressed weakly in the
CNS but strongly in some peripheral tissues (Yuan et al., 1999). To
investigate the in vivo functions of SLIT3, Yuan et al. (2003)
introduced a null mutation into Slit3 in mice by targeted mutagenesis in
embryonic stem (ES) cells. They found that Slit3-null mice developed a
congenital diaphragmatic hernia similar to a central CDH in humans.

Zhang et al. (2009) found that phenotypically normal Slit3 +/- mouse
diaphragms had a uniform vessel architecture with regular branching
pattern and density. In contrast, Slit3 -/- diaphragms showed tortuous
vascular patterns with dramatically reduced density and branching.

609883	TITLE *609883 MKS1 GENE; MKS1
;;FLJ20345;;
BBS13 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MKS1 belongs to a small family of B9 domain-containing proteins that
also includes B9D1 (614144) and B9D2 (611951), and all 3 B9
domain-containing proteins associate with basal bodies and primary cilia
in mammalian cells (summary by Bialas et al., 2009).

CLONING

Kyttala et al. (2006) identified the MKS1 gene (FLJ20345) in a 100-kb
region of chromosome 17q23 to which Meckel syndrome had been linked in
Finnish families. The gene contains an open reading frame (bp 76-1755)
coding for a 559-amino acid polypeptide containing a conserved B9
domain. Comparison of sequence across human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit
fly, and C. elegans showed high conservation. Human and mouse coding
regions are 86 to 88% similar at the nucleotide level and 89% at the
amino acid level. In situ hybridization analyses showed a relatively
broad tissue expression of Mks1 in mouse embryo at embryonic day 15.5.
The expression was especially prominent in tissues showing malformations
characteristic of Meckel syndrome: brain, liver, kidney, and digits of
the upper limbs. Highest expression was observed in bronchiolar
epithelium. Hypoplastic lungs are frequently reported in MKS patients,
but this feature had been presumed to be caused by lack of amniotic
fluid and mechanical pressure from the enlarged kidneys.

By immunohistochemical analysis of 18- to 20-week-old human fetal
kidneys, Dawe et al. (2007) found moderate to high expression of
meckelin (MKS3, or TMEM67; 609884) and MKS1 at the proximal renal tubule
epithelia, but not at glomeruli. In liver, these proteins were expressed
at the biliary epithelium of larger bile ducts, but not in hepatocytes.
In biliary epithelial cells, MKS1 showed a clear punctate doublet
staining pattern characteristic of a centrosomal localization. In HEK293
cells, MKS1 showed a broad intracellular localization with occasional
distribution at the cell border. Western blot analysis detected MKS1 at
an apparent molecular mass of 70 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference, Dawe et al. (2007) found that knockdown of
either Mks1 or Mks3 in mouse inner medullary IMCD-3 cells blocked
centriole migration to the apical membrane and formation of the primary
cilium. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that wildtype Mks1 and
Mks3 interacted, and knockdown of either Mks1 or Mks3 in IMCD-3 cells
decreased the formation of highly branched structures and tubules in
3-dimensional cultures. Dawe et al. (2007) concluded that MKS1 and MKS3
have roles in ciliogenesis and renal tubulogenesis.

Tammachote et al. (2009) showed that kidney tissue and cells from MKS1
and MKS3 (607361) patients showed defects in centrosome and cilia
number, including multiciliated respiratory-like epithelia, and longer
cilia. Stable shRNA knockdown of Mks1 and Mks3 in IMCD-3 cells induced
multiciliated and multicentrosomal phenotypes. MKS1 and MKS3 functions
are required for ciliary structure and function, including a role in
regulating length and appropriate number through modulating centrosome
duplication. Tammachote et al. (2009) concluded that MKS1 and MKS3 are
ciliopathies, with new cilia-related eye and sperm phenotypes defined.

Williams et al. (2011) showed that the conserved proteins Mks1, Mksr1
(B9D1), Mksr2 (B9D2; 611951), Tmem67, Rpgrip1l (610937), Cc2d2a
(612013), Nphp1 (607100), and Nphp4 (607215) functioned at an early
stage of ciliogenesis in C. elegans. These 8 proteins localized to the
ciliary transition zone and established attachments between the basal
body and transition zone membrane. They also provided a docking site
that restricted vesicle fusion to vesicles containing ciliary proteins.

Using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to isolate
proteins that purified with B9d1 (614144) in mouse IMCD3 cells and
embryonic fibroblasts, Chih et al. (2012) identified several components
of the B9d1-containing ciliary complex, including Tmem231 (614949),
Tmem17 (614950), B9d2 (611951), Tctn1 (609863), Tctn2 (613846), Mks1,
Ahi1 (608894), Cc2d2a (612013), and Kctd10 (613421).

GENE STRUCTURE

Kyttala et al. (2006) determined that the 14-kb MKS1 gene consists of 18
exons.

MAPPING

The human MKS1 gene resides on chromosome 17q23 (Kyttala et al., 2006).
The mouse homolog maps to a region of chromosome 11 demonstrating
homology of synteny with human 17q23.

EVOLUTION

Using database analysis, Bialas et al. (2009) found orthologs of B9D1,
B9D2, and MKS1 in the vast majority of ciliated species, but not in
nonciliated organisms. The 3 B9 domain-containing proteins appeared to
be evolutionarily ancient, and the duplications resulting in the 3
protein clades preceded speciation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Meckel Syndrome

Meckel syndrome (MKS) is a severe fetal developmental disorder inherited
as an autosomal recessive. The clinical hallmarks are occipital
meningoencephalocele, cystic kidney dysplasia, fibrotic changes of the
liver, and polydactyly. Genetic heterogeneity was established by genome
linkage scans. The MKS1 locus on 17q (249000) was identified in Finnish
families. Kyttala et al. (2006) found that in Finnish families in which
the MKS1 locus was identified, 70% of the patients were homozygous for
the same haplotype on 17q23. Sequence analysis of the MKS1 gene showed a
29-bp deletion in intron 15 (609883.0001) in 3 Finnish families sharing
the MKS1 haplotype and in 1 German patient with evidence of linkage to
17q23. This deletion was located only 4 bp away from the splice acceptor
site and was predicted to interrupt the splice branching site. The
intronic deletion was detected as a size difference in PCR products from
genomic DNA, and analysis of DNA samples of 26 Finnish families with the
common founder haplotype confirmed that all individuals were homozygous,
and that parents were heterozygous, for this deletion. Comparative
genomics and proteomics data implicated MKS1 in ciliary function. Review
of the series of 67 Finnish MKS patients reported by Salonen (1984)
showed 3 cases with situs inversus totalis (see 270100), which implied
an increased risk for this rare condition in Meckel syndrome and would
provide another link to ciliary dysfunction.

Consugar et al. (2007) identified mutations in the MKS1 gene in affected
individuals in 5 of 17 families with a clinical diagnosis of Meckel
syndrome. All 5 families had the major Finnish deletion mutation: 2 were
homozygous, and 3 were compound heterozygous with another pathogenic
mutation (609883.0004 and 609883.0005).

- Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 13

Leitch et al. (2008) demonstrated that mutations in MKS1, MKS3 (609884),
and CEP290 (610142) either can cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900) or
may have a potential epistatic effect on mutations in known
BBS-associated loci. Five of 6 families with both MKS1 and BBS mutations
manifested seizures, a feature that is not a typical component of either
Meckel or Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Functional studies in zebrafish showed
that mks1 is necessary for gastrulation movements and that it interacts
genetically with known bbs genes. In 1 patient compound heterozygous
mutations in MKS1 resulting in the BBS phenotype were found (see
609883.0006). In 5 families a single heterozygous mutation in MKS1 was
found. Two of these families also carried mutations in BBS10 (610148),
and a third family carried a homozygous mutation in BBS1 (209901).
Leitch et al. (2008) concluded that their data extended the genetic
stratification of ciliopathies and suggested that BBS and MKS, although
distinct clinically, are allelic forms of the same molecular spectrum.

Weatherbee et al. (2009) showed that loss of function of mouse Mks1
resulted in an accurate model of Meckel syndrome, with structural
abnormalities in the neural tube, biliary duct, limb patterning, bone
development, and the kidney. In contrast to cell culture studies, loss
of Mks1 in vivo did not interfere with apical localization of epithelial
basal bodies, but rather led to defective cilia formation in most, but
not all, tissues. Analysis of patterning in the neural tube and the limb
demonstrated altered Hedgehog (Hh) pathway signaling underlying some MKS
defects, although both tissues showed an expansion of the domain of
response to Shh (600725) signaling, unlike the phenotypes seen in other
mutants with cilia loss. Other defects in the skull, lung, rib cage, and
long bones were thought likely to be the result of disruption of Hh
signaling. Weatherbee et al. (2009) concluded that disruption of Hh
signaling may explain many, but not all, of the defects caused by loss
of Mks1.

Bialas et al. (2009) disrupted the B9 domains of C. elegans mks1, mksr1,
and mksr2. In contrast to the defect found in mouse cells, C. elegans
expressing single, double, or triple mks/mksr mutants showed no overt
defects in ciliary structure, nor in intraflagellar transport,
chemosensation, osmosensation, or lipid accumulation. However,
disruption of one B9 domain-containing protein resulted in
mislocalization of the others, and all possible double mks/mksr mutant
combinations altered insulin signaling, leading to increased life span.
The mks1/mksr1/mksr2 triple mutant did not exhibit a longevity
phenotype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MKS1, 29-BP DEL

In 3 Finnish families sharing the founder MKS1 haplotype and in 1 German
patient with evidence of linkage of Meckel syndrome to 17q23 (249000),
Kyttala et al. (2006) found that the MKS1 gene showed a 29-bp deletion
in intron 15 as the cause of the anomaly. This deletion was located only
4 bp away from the splice acceptor site and probably interrupted the
splice branching site. The same intronic deletion was found in 26
Finnish families with a common founder haplotype; all affected
individuals were homozygous, and the parents heterozygous, for the
deletion, which Kyttala et al. (2006) called the MKS1-Fin(major)
mutation. This mutation was also found in an American family and in a
family of mixed Swedish-Portuguese-Irish descent.

Auber et al. (2007) identified the 29-bp deletion in intron 15 of the
MKS1 gene in 8 of 20 unrelated fetuses diagnosed clinically with MKS.
Six cases, consisting of 1 heterozygous and 5 homozygous mutations, had
the campomelic variant of the disorder. The carrier frequency of this
mutation in the German population was determined to be 1 in 260.

.0002
MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MKS1, 5-BP INS, NT50

In a case of Meckel syndrome (249000) of German ancestry, Kyttala et al.
(2006) found compound heterozygosity for mutations in MKS1 located at
the very beginning of the transcript: a 5-bp insertion in exon 1
(50insCCGGG), causing a frameshift (P17fsX163); and a T-to-C
substitution at the splice donor site of intron 1 (IVS1+2T-C;
609883.0003).

.0003
MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MKS1, IVS1, T-C, +2

See Kyttala et al. (2006) and 609883.0002.

.0004
MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MKS1, IVS11DS, G-A, +1

In a 16-week-old fetus with Meckel syndrome (249000) diagnosed by
ultrasound, Consugar et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 mutations in the MKS1 gene: a G-to-A transition in intron 11
(IVS11+1G-A), resulting in a splice site mutation inherited from the
African American mother, and the major Finnish mutation (609883.0001)
inherited from the Caucasian father.

.0005
MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MKS1, 417G-A

In 2 unrelated fetuses with Meckel syndrome (249000), Consugar et al.
(2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MKS1
gene: a 417G-A transition in exon 4 and the major Finnish mutation
(609883.0001). The families were of Dutch and German origin,
respectively. RT-PCR and direct sequencing showed that the 417G-A change
resulted in abnormal splicing and deletion of exon 4.

.0006
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 13
MKS1, CYS492TRP

In a child of Turkish descent with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900),
Leitch et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in
the MKS1 gene, 1 resulting in a cysteine-to-tryptophan substitution at
codon 492 (C492W), the other a deletion of phenylalanine at codon 371
(see 609883.0007). The patient was 2 years old and had not yet
manifested retinitis pigmentosa but showed obesity, polydactyly, and
nystagmus.

.0007
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 13
MKS1, 3-BP DEL, PHE371

In a patient with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900) of Turkish descent,
Leitch et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in
the MKS1 gene, one a deletion of a phenylalanine at codon 371 (F371del)
and the other a missense mutation at codon 492 (609883.0006). Neither of
these mutations was found in 192 control chromosomes, and no mutations
in any of the 12 theretofore known BBS genes were found in this patient.

189908	TITLE *189908 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 7; TCF7
;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, T CELL-SPECIFIC, 1;;
T CELL FACTOR 1; TCF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Three of the genes determining subunits of the CD3 complex, CD3-gamma
(CD3G; 186740), CD3-delta (CD3D; 186790), and CD3-epsilon (CD3E;
186830), are tightly clustered in a stretch of 60 kb of DNA on human
chromosome 11q23. This tight clustering might suggest that the CD3 genes
are controlled by a single cis-acting element. Experiments with
transgenic mice, however, have shown that at least the CD3D and CD3E
genes carry a complete and independent set of regulatory elements. CD3E
gene expression appears to be controlled by a downstream T
lymphocyte-specific enhancer element. By screening for proteins in human
T cells that bound the T lymphocyte-specific enhancer element downstream
of CD3E, followed by screening human T-cell line cDNA libraries, van de
Wetering et al. (1991) cloned 3 splice variants of TCF7, which they
called TCF1A, TCF1B, and TCF1C. The deduced proteins contain 269, 269,
and 268 amino acids, respectively. Each has an N-terminal proline-rich
domain, followed by an HMG1 (HMGB1; 163905)-like DNA-binding domain and
a unique C-terminal end. Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb
transcript in all human T-cell lines examined, but not in non-T cell
lines.

Van de Wetering et al. (1992) stated that the HMG box domain of TCF7 is
almost identical to the HMG box domain of TCF1-alpha (LEF1; 153245).

Van de Wetering et al. (1996) cloned several additional TCF7 splice
variants encoding at least 8 TCF7 isoforms. The isoforms differ
predominantly in the presence or absence of a long N-terminal domain,
the presence or absence of an insertion near the center of the molecule,
and the presence or absence of a long C-terminal domain. The 116-amino
acid long N-terminal domain shares significant similarity with LEF1.
Western blot analysis of human thymocytes and Jurkat T cells showed
proteins with apparent molecular masses of 25 to 55 kD.
Dephosphorylation did not alter the mobility of the proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van de Wetering et al. (1992) found that the TCF7 gene contains at least
10 exons, the first of which is noncoding. The region immediately
upstream of exon 1 is CG rich (75%) and includes a CpG island. The CpG
island coincided with a functional promoter that was preferentially
active in T-cell lines.

Van de Wetering et al. (1996) determined that the TCF7 gene spans about
12 kb and contains 14 exons, 4 of which are alternatively spliced. It
has 2 promoter regions and 2 transcriptional start sites.

MAPPING

Van de Wetering et al. (1991) mapped the TCF7 gene to chromosome 5q31.1
by somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Kingsmore et al. (1995) mapped the homologous gene to mouse chromosome
11.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a gel retardation assay, van de Wetering et al. (1991) showed that
all 3 recombinant isoforms of TCF7, which they called TCF1A, TCF1B, and
TCF1C, bound the same motif in the T lymphocyte-specific enhancer
element downstream of CD3E. Following expression in COS cells,
full-length TCF1A, but not TCF1A lacking part of its DNA-binding domain,
activated transcription of a reporter gene.

Van de Wetering et al. (1996) showed that all TCF7 isoforms with the
short N-terminal end moderately transactivated transcription through the
TCR-alpha (TCRA; see 186880) enhancer, a LEF1 target. In contrast, TCF7
isoforms with the long N-terminal end showed no transactivation
activity.

Roose et al. (1999) identified TCF7 mRNA by Northern blot analysis in 5
of 6 colorectal cell lines. Three of these were APC (611731) mutants,
and 2 others carried oncogenic mutations in beta-catenin (CTNNB1;
116806). The cell line that lacked TCF7 expression was wildtype for APC
and beta-catenin, suggesting that APC and beta-catenin may regulate TCF7
expression. Roose et al. (1999) also detected nuclear TCF7 protein in
normal human tissues: in proliferating intestinal epithelial cells and
in the basal epithelial cells of mammary gland epithelium. Roose et al.
(1999) noted that the most abundant TCF7 isoforms lack a beta-catenin
interaction domain and are likely to function as negative regulators of
Wnt signaling (see 164820). Roose et al. (1999) identified TCF7 as one
of the target genes of TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228) in epithelial cells. They
found a putative enhancer upstream of promoter 1 of TCF7. Reporter
assays showed that a combination of TCF4 and beta-catenin transactivated
the enhancer, whereas a dominant-negative TCF4 inhibited enhancer
activity.

Gattinoni et al. (2009) reported that induction of Wnt/beta-catenin
signaling by inhibitors of Gsk3b (605004) or by Wnt3a (606359) arrested
mouse Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell development into effector T cells
capable of cytotoxicity or Ifng (147570) production. Instead, Wnt
signaling promoted expression of Tcf7 and Lef1 (153245) and generation
of self-renewing multipotent Cd8-positive memory stem cells capable of
proliferation and antitumor activity. Gattinoni et al. (2009) concluded
that Wnt signaling has a key role in maintaining the self-renewing stem
cell-like properties of mature memory CD8-positive T cells.

Using RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, Zhao et al. (2010)
demonstrated that mouse Tcf7 and Lef1 were highly expressed in naive T
cells, downregulated in effector T cells, and upregulated in memory T
cells. Memory Cd8-positive T cells expressing the p45 Tcf7 isoform and
beta-catenin had enhanced Il2 (147680) production capacity and enhanced
effector capacity to clear Listeria monocytogenes. Zhao et al. (2010)
concluded that constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway favors memory
CD8 T-cell formation during immunization, resulting in enhanced immunity
upon a second encounter with the same pathogen.

Using a genetic approach, Driessens et al. (2010) found no evidence that
the beta-catenin pathway regulates T-cell memory phenotype, in contrast
with the findings of Gattinoni et al. (2009). The findings of Driessens
et al. (2010) suggested that the generation of Cd8-positive memory stem
cells observed by Gattinoni et al. (2009) with the use of Gsk3b
inhibitors was not a consequence of activation of the beta-catenin
pathway, but was rather due activation of another Gsk3b-dependent
pathway. In a reply, Gattinoni et al. (2010) noted that others,
including Zhao et al. (2010) and Jeannet et al. (2010), had also
identified Wnt and beta-catenin as crucial factors in postthymic
Cd8-positive T-cell differentiation and memory development. Using
Western blot analysis, Gattinoni et al. (2010) showed that addition of
Wnt3a or Gsk3b inhibitor stabilized beta-catenin in primed Cd8-positive
mouse T cells.

Weber et al. (2011) found that Tcf7 was highly expressed in mouse early
tymic progenitor cells and that its expression was upregulated in
response to Notch1 (190198) signals. Forcible expression of human TCF7
in mouse bone marrow progenitors drove development of T-lineage cells in
the absence of Notch1 signals. These Tcf7-induced cells expressed
T-cell-specific transcription factors, such as Gata3 (131320) and Bcl11b
(606558), as well as T-cell receptor components, such as Cd3e. Weber et
al. (2011) concluded that TCF7 is essential for normal T-cell
development and sufficient to establish many components of T-cell
identity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Verbeek et al. (1995) generated 2 independent germline mutations in Tcf7
by targeted disruption and found that thymocyte development in the
otherwise normal mutant mice was blocked at the transition from the
Cd8-positive immature single-positive to the Cd4
(186940)-positive/Cd8-positive double-positive stage. In contrast with
wildtype mice, most of the immature single-positive cells in the mutant
mice were not in the cell cycle, and the number of immunocompetent T
cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs was reduced. Verbeek et al.
(1995) concluded that TCF7 controls an essential step in thymocyte
differentiation.

Roose et al. (1999) found that Tcf7 -/- mice developed adenomas in the
gut and mammary glands. They hypothesized that one possible explanation
for the tumor phenotype in Tcf7 -/- mice is that Tcf7 acts as a feedback
transcriptional repressor of beta-catenin/Tcf4 target genes, and that
disruption of this negative-feedback loop allows the formation of
epithelial tumors, much like the loss of Apc. This notion predicts
synergy between the loss of Tcf7 and of Apc. To test this, Roose et al.
(1999) crossed the Apc allele Min into a Tcf7 -/- strain. Min/+ mice
developed multiple polyps, mostly in the small intestine. They
infrequently developed extraintestinal neoplasia, notably
adenoacanthomas in the mammary gland. Min/+ Tcf7 -/- mice displayed a
marked enhancement of the intestinal Min/+ phenotype. All intestinal
neoplasms expressed high levels of beta-catenin. In addition, all
females carried adenoacanthomas of the mammary gland by 8 weeks of age,
while substantial numbers of older male mice developed similar lesions.
Roose et al. (1999) concluded that TCF7 may act as a feedback repressor
of beta-catenin/TCF4 target genes and thus may cooperate with APC to
suppress malignant transformation of epithelial cells.

Jeannet et al. (2010) found that mice lacking Tcf7, a nuclear effector
of Wnt signaling, mounted normal effector and memory Cd8-positive T-cell
responses to viral infection. However, Tcf7-deficient mice were impaired
in their ability to expand upon secondary challenge and to protect from
recurrent virus infection due to a lack of Cd8 memory precursor T cells.
Establishment of memory cells was dependent on the Tcf7
beta-catenin-binding domain and required the Tcf7 coactivators and Wnt
signaling intermediates beta-catenin and gamma-catenin (JUP; 173325).
Jeannet et al. (2010) concluded that the Wnt signaling pathway plays an
essential role for CD8 central memory T-cell differentiation and
proposed that modulation of Wnt signaling may be exploited to improve
the generation of CD8 memory T cells during vaccination or
immunotherapy.

Zhou et al. (2010) showed that loss of Tcf7 in mice limited
proliferation of Cd8-positive effector T cells and impaired their
differentiation into memory cells. Tcf7 -/- memory Cd8-positive T cells
were progressively lost and exhibited reduced expression of Bcl2
(151430) and Il2rb (146710) and diminished Il15 (600554)-driven
proliferation. Transcriptome analysis of Tcf7 -/- memory Cd8-positive
cells showed strong downregulation of Eomes (604615). The Wnt-Tcf7
pathway was necessary and sufficient for inducing optimal expression of
Eomes, which positively regulated Il2rb expression and Il15
responsiveness. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct
and specific binding of Tcf7 and multiple conserved cis-regulatory
sequences of the Eomes gene. Zhou et al. (2010) concluded that TCF7 is a
critical player in a transcriptional program that regulates memory CD8
differentiation and longevity.

NOMENCLATURE

Although the symbol TCF1 (T cell-specific transcription factor-1) is
used in the literature for this gene, its official designation is TCF7.
It should not be confused with the HNF1A gene (142410), which has also
been referred to as TCF1 (transcription factor-1) in the literature.

608793	TITLE *608793 SPERM ANTIGEN WITH CALPONIN HOMOLOGY AND COILED-COIL DOMAINS 1; SPECC1
;;HCMOGT1;;
NSP
HCMOGT1/PDGFRB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for cDNA clones encoding novel structural proteins,
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Sang
et al. (2004) cloned 4 splice variants of the SPECC1 gene, which they
called NSP. Database analysis showed that the SPECC1 gene is almost
identical to the human sperm antigen, HCMOGT1. There are 2 possible
5-prime ends and 2 possible 3-prime ends. The major coding sequence
shared by all isolated transcripts encodes an ATPase domain similar to
that of SMC family members (see SMC1A; 300040) and a coiled-coil domain
commonly seen in motor or structure proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of 4.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts in testis. The
larger transcript was also expressed in spleen, but all other normal
tissues examined showed little or no SPECC1 expression. Variable
expression was detected in some human cancer cell lines, including HeLa
cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of HeLa cells detected SPECC1 in the
nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sang et al. (2004) determined that the SPECC1 gene contains 17 exons and
spans at least 227 kb.

MAPPING

Morerio et al. (2004) identified the HCMOGT1 gene as the fusion partner
on chromosome 17p11.2 of the PDGFRB gene in a t(5;17)(q33;p11.2)
translocation.

By FISH, Sang et al. (2004) mapped the SPECC1 gene to chromosome
17p11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

Morerio et al. (2004) identified the HCMOGT1 gene as a novel fusion
partner to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta gene
(PDGFRB; 173410) by study of the translocation t(5;17)(q33;p11.2) in a
case of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (607785). The HCMOGT1 cDNA
sequence was fused in-frame to PDGFRB at nucleotide 1936 and situated
5-prime to the PDGFRB portion, as in previous studies of PDGFRB fusion
partners. PDGFRB, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, is
constitutively activated by gene fusion with different partners in
myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders with peculiar clinical
characteristics. The patient studied by Morerio et al. (2004) presented
all the features common to patients with PDGFRB rearrangement: male sex,
splenomegaly, monocytosis, and eosinophilia. Nevertheless, peculiar and
noteworthy were both the age at presentation (18 months) and the
hematologic diagnosis (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia). Most reported
cases with demonstrated PDGFRB involvement present at a median age of 50
to 60 years; pediatric cases are rare.

602027	TITLE *602027 TELOMERIC REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR 2; TERF2
;;TRF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human telomeres are composed of long arrays of TTAGGG repeats that form
a nucleoprotein complex required for the protection and replication of
chromosome ends. One component of human telomeres is the TTAGGG repeat
binding factor-1 (TRF1; 600951), a ubiquitously expressed protein
related to the protooncogene Myb (189990), that is present at telomeres
throughout the cell cycle. TRF1 is involved in the control of telomere
lengths. It functions as an inhibitor of telomerase, acting in cis to
limit the elongation of individual chromosome ends. Broccoli et al.
(1997) reported the cloning of TRF2, a distant homolog of TRF1 that
carries a very similar Myb-related DNA-binding motif (also called the
'telobox'). Like TRF1, TRF2 is ubiquitously expressed, bound
specifically to duplex TTAGGG repeats in vitro, and localized to all
human telomeres in metaphase chromosomes. TRF2 was shown to have an
architecture similar to that of TRF1 in that it carries a C-terminal Myb
motif and a large TRF1-related dimerization domain near its N terminus.
However, the dimerization domains of TRF1 and TRF2 did not interact,
suggesting that these proteins exist predominantly as homodimers. While
having similar telomere binding activity and domain organization, TRF2
differs from TRF1 in that its N terminus is basic rather than acidic,
and TRF2 is much more conserved than TRF1. Because of the differences
between TRF1 and TRF2, Broccoli et al. (1997) suggested that these
factors have distinct functions at the telomeres. Independently, Bilaud
et al. (1997) identified a second human open reading frame containing a
telobox sequence and encoding a polypeptide that specifically recognizes
mammalian telomeric repeat DNA in vitro. They showed that 2 proteins of
65 and 69 kD, expressed in HeLa cells, contain this second telobox
sequence. These proteins were collectively termed TRF2.
Affinity-purified antibodies specific for anti-TRF2 labeled the
telomeres of intact human chromosomes, strengthening the correlation
between occurrence of telobox and telomere-repeat recognition in vivo.

GENE FUNCTION

Van Steensel et al. (1998) showed that the human telomeric protein TRF2
plays a key role in the protective activity of telomeres. A
dominant-negative allele of TRF2 induced end-to-end chromosome fusions
detectable in metaphase and anaphase cells. Telomeric DNA persisted at
the fusions, demonstrating that TTAGGG repeats per se are not sufficient
for telomere integrity. Molecular analysis suggested that the fusions
represented ligation of telomeres that have lost their single-stranded
G-tails. Van Steensel et al. (1998) concluded that TRF2 may protect
chromosome ends by maintaining the correct structure at telomere
termini. In addition, expression of mutant forms of TRF2 induced a
growth arrest with characteristics of senescence. These results raise
the possibility that chromosome end fusions and senescence in primary
human cells may be caused by loss by TRF2 from shortened telomeres.

Using electron microscopy, Griffith et al. (1999) demonstrated that TRF2
can remodel linear telomeric DNA into large duplex loops (t loops) in
vitro. Electron microscopy analysis of psoralen cross-linked telomeric
DNA purified from human and mouse cells revealed abundant large t loops
with a size distribution consistent with their telomeric origin. Binding
of TRF1 and single-stranded DNA-binding protein (600439) suggested that
t loops are formed by invasion of the 3-prime telomeric overhang into
the duplex telomeric repeat array. Griffith et al. (1999) concluded that
t loops may provide a general mechanism for the protection and
replication of telomeres.

Telomeres allow cells to distinguish natural chromosome ends from
damaged DNA and protect the ends from degradation and fusion. In human
cells, telomere protection depends on the TTAGGG repeat-binding factor
TRF2, which may remodel telomeres into t loops. Zhu et al. (2000)
demonstrated cell cycle-regulated association of the RAD50/MRE11/NBS1
complex (see 604040) with TRF2 and human telomeres. Although the MRE11
complex accumulated in irradiation-induced foci (IRIFs) in response to
gamma-irradiation, TRF2 did not relocate to IRIFs and irradiation did
not affect the association of TRF2 with the MRE11 complex, arguing
against a role for TRF2 in double-strand break repair. Zhu et al. (2000)
proposed that the RAD50/MRE11/NBS1 complex functions at telomeres,
possibly by modulating t loop formation.

In mammalian cells, abrogation of telomeric repeat binding factor TRF2
were DNA-dependent protein kinase (600899) activity causes end to end
chromosomal fusion, thus establishing a central role for these proteins
in telomere function. Bailey et al. (2001) demonstrated that
TRF2-mediated end-capping occurs after telomere replication. The
postreplicative requirement for TRF2 and DNA-PK catalytic subunit is
confined to only half of the telomeres, namely, those that were produced
by leading-strand DNA synthesis. Bailey et al. (2001) concluded that
their results demonstrate a crucial difference in postreplicative
processing of telomeres that is linked to their mode of replication.

Karlseder et al. (2002) reported that overexpression of TRF2 increased
the rate of telomere shortening in primary cells without accelerating
senescence. TRF2 reduced the senescence set point, defined as telomere
length at senescence, from 7 to 4 kb. TRF2 protected critically short
telomeres from fusion and repressed chromosome-end fusions in
presenescent cultures, which explained the ability of TRF2 to delay
senescence. Thus, Karlseder et al. (2002) concluded that replicative
senescence is induced by a change in the protected status of shortened
telomeres rather than by a complete loss of telomeric DNA.

Opresko et al. (2002) found that TRF2 colocalized and physically
interacted with the RecQ DNA helicase, WRN (604611), and that the
interaction was mediated by the RecQ conserved C-terminal region of WRN.
In vitro, TRF2 showed high affinity for WRN and for a second RecQ DNA
helicase, BLM (RECQL3; 604610). TRF2 interaction with either helicase
resulted in stimulation of its activity. The WRN or BLM helicases,
partnered with replication protein A (see 179835), actively unwound long
telomeric duplex regions that were pre-bound by TRF2. Opresko et al.
(2002) concluded that TRF2 functions with WRN, and possibly BLM, in a
common pathway at the telomeric ends.

Telomerase-negative immortalized human cells maintain telomeres by
alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway(s), which may involve
homologous recombination (Bryan et al., 1997). Stavropoulos et al.
(2002) found that endogenous BLM protein colocalized with telomeric foci
in ALT human cells but not telomerase-positive immortal cell lines or
primary cells. BLM interacted in vivo with the telomeric protein TRF2 in
ALT cells, as detected by FRET and coimmunoprecipitation. Transient
overexpression of GFP-BLM resulted in marked, ALT cell-specific
increases in telomeric DNA. The association of BLM with telomeres and
its effect on telomere DNA synthesis required a functional helicase
domain. The authors suggested that BLM may facilitate
recombination-driven amplification of telomeres in ALT cells.

Wang et al. (2004) reported that a TRF2 mutant lacking the N-terminal
basic domain, termed TRF2(delta-B), suppressed nonhomologous end joining
but induced catastrophic deletions of telomeric DNA. The deletion events
were stochastic and occurred rapidly, generating dramatically shortened
telomeres that were accompanied by a DNA damage response and induction
of senescence. TRF2(delta-B)-induced deletions depended on XRCC3
(600675), a protein implicated in Holliday junction resolution, and
created t-loop-sized telomeric circles. These telomeric circles were
also detected in unperturbed cells and suggested that t-loop deletion by
homologous recombination might contribute to telomere attrition. Human
ALT cells had abundant telomeric circles, pointing to frequent t-loop
homologous recombination events that could promote rolling circle
replication of telomeres in the absence of telomerase.

In addition to increased DNA strand exchange, another cytogenetic
feature of Bloom syndrome (210900) cells lacking BLM is the tendency for
telomeres to associate. Lillard-Wetherell et al. (2004) reported that
BLM colocalized and complexed with TERF2 in cells that employ ALT. BLM
colocalized with TERF2 in foci actively synthesizing DNA during late S
and G2/M; colocalization increased in late S and G2/M when ALT is
thought to occur. TERF1 (600951) and TERF2 interacted directly with BLM
and regulated its unwinding activity in vitro. Whereas TERF2 stimulated
BLM unwinding of telomeric and nontelomeric substrates, TERF1 inhibited
its unwinding of telomeric substrates only. TERF2 stimulated BLM
unwinding with equimolar concentrations of TERF1, but not when TERF1 was
added in molar excess. Lillard-Wetherell et al. (2004) proposed a
function for BLM in recombination-mediated telomere lengthening and a
model for the coordinated regulation of BLM activity at telomeres by
TERF1 and TERF2.

DNA damage surveillance networks in human cells can activate DNA repair,
cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis in response to fewer than 4
double-strand breaks (DSBs) per genome. These same networks tolerate
telomeres, in part because the protein TRF2 prevents recognition of
telomeric ends as DSBs by facilitating their organization into t loops.
Bradshaw et al. (2005) showed that TRF2 associates with photo-induced
DSBs in nontelomeric DNA in human fibroblasts within 2 seconds of
irradiation. These and other results implicated TRF2 in an initial stage
of DSB recognition and processing that occurs before association of ATM
(607585) with DSBs and activation of the ATM-dependent DSB response
network.

Telomere repeats in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are
bound by Taz1, a regulator of diverse telomere functions. Miller et al.
(2006) showed that Taz1 is crucial for efficient replication fork
progression through the telomere. Using 2-dimensional gel
electrophoresis, Miller et al. (2006) found that loss of Taz1 leads to
stalled replication forks at telomeres and internally placed telomere
sequences, regardless of whether the telomeric G-rich strand is
replicated by leading- or lagging-strand synthesis. In contrast, the
Taz1-interacting protein Rap1 (605061) is dispensable for efficient
telomeric fork progression. Upon loss of telomerase, Taz1-delta
telomeres are lost precipitously, suggesting that maintenance of
Taz1-delta telomere repeats cannot be sustained through semiconservative
replication. As the human telomere proteins TRF1 and TRF2 are Taz1
orthologs, Miller et al. (2006) predicted that 1 or both of the human
TRFs may orchestrate fork passage through human telomeres. Stalled forks
at dysfunctional human telomeres are likely to accelerate the genomic
instability that drives tumorigenesis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and protein pull-down assays, Lenain et al. (2006)
showed that the N terminus of human Apollo (DCLRE1B; 609683) bound TRF2
in a DNA-independent manner. TRF2 was required for Apollo telomeric
localization.

Williams et al. (2007) observed the recruitment of fluorescence-tagged
TERF2 to sites of DNA damage in HeLa cells caused by a high-intensity
multiphoton laser beam in the presence of a photosensitizing dye, which
is consistent with the results of Bradshaw et al. (2005). However, no
recruitment of TERF2 to sites of DNA damage was elicited in human cells
and cell lines caused by a more conventional laser beam, or by exposure
to alpha particle irradiation or ultraviolet C light. Williams et al.
(2007) concluded that DNA double-strand breaks are not sufficient to
initiate recruitment of TRF2.

Mammalian telomeres are protected by a 6-protein complex, shelterin.
Shelterin contains 2 closely related proteins, TRF1 (600951) and TRF2,
which recruit various proteins to telomeres. Chen et al. (2008)
dissected the interactions of TRF1 and TRF2 with their shared binding
partner TIN2 (604319) and other shelterin accessory factors. TRF1
recognizes TIN2 using a conserved molecular surface in its TRF homology
domain. However, this same surface does not act as a TIN2 binding site
in TRF2, and TIN2 binding to TRF2 is mediated by a region outside the
TRF homology domain. Instead, the TRF homology domain docking site of
TRF2 binds a shelterin accessory factor, Apollo, which does not interact
with the TRF homology domain of TRF1. Conversely, the TRF homology
domain of TRF1, but not of TRF2, interacts with another
shelterin-associated factor, PINX1 (606505).

Sfeir et al. (2010) removed Rap1 from mouse telomeres either through
gene deletion or by replacing Trf2 with a mutant that does not bind
Rap1. Rap1 was dispensable for essential functions of Trf2--repression
of ATM kinase signaling and nonhomologous end-joining--and mice lacking
telomeric Rap1 were viable and fertile. However, Rap1 was critical for
the repression of homology-directed repair, which can alter telomere
length. The data of Sfeir et al. (2010) revealed that homology-directed
repair at telomeres can take place in the absence of DNA damage foci and
underscored the functional compartmentalization within shelterin.

Ye et al. (2010) showed that TRF2 stimulated the exonuclease activity of
Apollo against single-stranded telomeric DNA, but not against
double-stranded substrates that mimicked telomeric DNA ends. Both
proteins bound an 800-bp telomeric sequence artificially integrated into
the middle of chromosome 4q. Telomere deficiencies due to inhibition or
knockdown of TOP2-alpha (TOP2A; 126430) were rescued by overexpression
of Apollo and TRF2. Overexpression of Apollo and TRF2 reduced the
requirement for TOP2-alpha for telomere replication. Ye et al. (2010)
found that TRF2 showed preferential binding to positively supercoiled
DNA. They hypothesized that TRF2-Apollo and TOP2 act in concert to
release positive superhelical strain created in telomeric DNA during
replication fork progression.

To define the telomere end-protection problem, Sfeir and de Lange (2012)
removed the whole shelterin complex from mouse telomeres through
conditional deletion of TRF1 and TFR2 in nonhomologous end-joining
(NHEJ)-deficient cells. The data revealed 2 DNA damage response pathways
not theretofore observed upon deletion of individual shelterin proteins.
The shelterin-free telomeres are processed by microhomology-mediated
alternative-NHEJ when Ku70/80 (152690/194364) is absent and are attacked
by nucleolytic degradation in the absence of 53BP1 (605230). Sfeir and
de Lange (2012) concluded that their data established that the
end-protection problem is specified by 6 pathways (ATM and ATR
signaling, classical-NHEJ, alt-NHEJ, homologous recombination, and
resection), and showed how shelterin acts with general DNA damage
response factors to solve this problem.

Okamoto et al. (2013) addressed the molecular properties of TRF2 that
are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome ends in mouse
embryonic fibroblasts, and stated that their data supported a 2-step
mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First, the dimerization
domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM (607585) activation, the key
initial step involved in the activation of a DNA damage response (DDR).
Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the propagation of DNA damage
signaling downstream of ATM activation. This novel modulation of the DDR
at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168
(612688). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres involves the
deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 (300617) and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5
(608413), and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions.
Okamoto et al. (2013) concluded that this 2-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection helped to explain the apparent paradox of
frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without
concurrent induction of detrimental DNA repair activities.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

TRF1 and TRF2 are key components of vertebrate telomeres and bind to
double-stranded telomeric DNA as homodimers. Dimerization involves the
TRF homology (TRFH) domain, which also mediates interactions with other
telomeric proteins. Fairall et al. (2001) determined the crystal
structures of the dimerization domains from human TRF1 and TRF2 at 2.9-
and 2.2-angstrom resolution, respectively. Despite a modest sequence
identity, the 2 TRFH domains have the same entirely alpha-helical
architecture, resembling a twisted horseshoe. The dimerization
interfaces feature unique interactions that prevent heterodimerization.
Mutational analysis of TRF1 corroborated the structural data and
underscored the importance of the TRFH domain in dimerization, DNA
binding, and telomere localization.

MAPPING

Sakaguchi et al. (1998) mapped the TERF2 gene to chromosome 16q22.1 by
analysis of a monochromosomal mapping panel and a radiation hybrid
panel. The mouse Terf2 gene was localized to chromosome 8, to a large
evolutionarily conserved linkage group of at least 25 genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Munoz et al. (2005) generated K5-Terf2 mice that expressed variable
levels of TRF2 under control of the 5-prime regulatory region of the
bovine keratin K5 promoter, which targets TRF2 to basal cells and stem
cells of the epidermis. These mice had a severe phenotype of the skin in
response to light, consisting of premature skin deterioration,
hyperpigmentation, and increased skin cancer, which resembled the human
syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (see 278700). Keratinocytes from these
mice were hypersensitive to ultraviolet irradiation and DNA crosslinking
agents. The skin cells of these mice had marked telomere shortening,
loss of the telomeric G-strand overhang, and increased chromosomal
instability. Telomere loss in these mice was mediated by XPF (278760), a
structure-specific nuclease involved in ultraviolet-induced damage
repair and mutated in individuals with 1 molecular form of xeroderma
pigmentosum. The findings suggested that TRF2 provides a crucial link
between telomere function and ultraviolet-induced damage repair, whose
alteration underlies genomic instability, cancer, and aging. Munoz et
al. (2005) showed that a number of human skin tumors had increased
expression of TRF2, further highlighting a role of TRF2 in skin cancer.

Using the K5-Terf2 mouse model, Blanco et al. (2007) showed that
increased Trf2 expression combined with telomerase deficiency resulted
in a dramatic acceleration of epithelial carcinogenesis that coincided
with increased telomere dysfunction and chromosomal instability.

602649	TITLE *602649 COLD-INDUCIBLE RNA-BINDING PROTEIN; CIRBP
;;CIRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cold stress induces in microorganisms the synthesis of several proteins
that are involved in various cellular processes such as transcription,
translation, and recombination. The cold-inducible RNA-binding protein
(Cirp) is induced in rodent cells by mild cold stress (32 degrees C).
Cirp consists of an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal
gly-rich domain, and plays an essential role in cold-induced suppression
of cell proliferation. Nishiyama et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding an
18-kD protein with 95.3% amino acid sequence identity to the mouse Cirp
protein. CIRBP mRNA was constitutively expressed in all cell lines
examined. In all of the cell lines, the levels of CIRBP mRNA and protein
were increased within 12 hours after a temperature downshift from 37
degrees C to 32 degrees C. These results demonstrated that CIRBP is a
cold-shock protein in human cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nishiyama et al. (1997) mapped
the CIRBP gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Morf et al. (2012) showed that simulated body temperature cycles, but
not peripheral oscillators, controlled the rhythmic expression of
cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) in cultured fibroblasts. In
turn, loss-of-function experiments indicated that CIRBP was required for
high-amplitude circadian gene expression. The transcriptomewide
identification of CIRBP-bound RNAs by a biotin-streptavidin-based
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) procedure revealed several
transcripts encoding circadian oscillator proteins, including CLOCK
(601851). Moreover, CLOCK accumulation was strongly reduced in
CIRBP-depleted fibroblasts. Because ectopic expression of CLOCK improved
circadian gene expression in these cells, Morf et al. (2012) concluded
that CIRBP confers robustness to circadian oscillators through
regulation of CLOCK expression.

DESCRIPTION See 142560. From cDNA clones, Banerji et al. (1990) determined the
complete sequences of the closely linked BAT2 and BAT3 genes. The
putative proteins are 228 and 110 kD, respectively, and do not appear to
be members of any known family of proteins, although BAT3 contains an
amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain. Both BAT2 and BAT3 are very rich
in proline and include short tracts of polyproline, polyglycine, and
charged amino acids. Thus they are similar to other proteins with large
proline-rich domains, such as some nuclear proteins, collagens, elastin
(130160), and synapsin (313440).

;;BVRB;;
NADPH-FLAVIN REDUCTASE; FLR;;
METHEMOGLOBIN REDUCTASE;;
NADPH REDUCTASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The final step in heme metabolism in mammals is catalyzed by the
cytosolic biliverdin reductase enzymes A and B (EC 1.3.1.24).

CLONING

Yamaguchi et al. (1993) isolated 2 biliverdin reductases. BLVRB, which
they called biliverdin-IX beta-reductase, is found predominantly in
fetal liver. BLVRA (109750), which they called biliverdin-IX
alpha-reductase, is a major component of human adult liver and is
identical to the enzyme previously reported as biliverdin reductase.

Chikuba et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding human erythrocyte
NADPH-flavin reductase (FLR) from a human reticulocyte library. The FLR
cDNA, which appeared to be identical to the BLVRB cDNA, encodes a
deduced 206-amino acid protein. Western blot analysis of rat tissues
showed highest levels of FLR in the erythrocytes and liver. Northern
blot analysis detected a 1.1-kb transcript in human tissues. FLR had
previously been isolated as an NADPH-dependent diaphorase, designated
diaphorase-2 (DIA2), by Fisher et al. (1977) and has also been called
methemoglobin reductase and NADPH reductase. Yubisui et al. (1977, 1979)
found that flavins are the effective electron acceptor of the enzyme and
purified FLR to homogeneity.

Quandt and Hultquist (1994) cloned bovine liver NADPH-flavin reductase.
The deduced bovine FLR protein shares 91% sequence homology with human
BLVRB.

Komuro et al. (1994) confirmed the identity of the human BLVRB and FLR
proteins. Northern blot analysis detected highest expression of BLVRB in
fetal liver and adult skeletal muscle and liver.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization using a 0.76-kb cDNA fragment as a
probe, Saito et al. (1995) mapped the BLVRB gene to chromosome
19q13.13-q13.2. The BLVRA gene maps to 7p14-cen.

;;EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PHOSPHOGLYCOPROTEIN, ASARM MOTIF-CONTAINING;;
OSTEOBLAST/OSTEOCYTE FACTOR 45; OF45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using expression screening of a tumor cDNA library to identify genes
upregulated in tumors of oncogenic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (OHO)
patients, Rowe et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding MEPE. The predicted
525-amino acid MEPE protein has a signal peptide, 2 N-glycosylation
motifs, a glycosaminoglycan-attachment site, an RGD cell-attachment
motif, and phosphorylation motifs. Rowe et al. (2000) noted that MEPE
shares molecular similarities with several dentin-bone extracellular
matrix RGD-containing phosphoglycoproteins, including dentin
sialophosphoprotein (DSPP; 125485), osteopontin (SPP1; 166490), and
dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1; 600980). RT-PCR detected MEPE expression
in bone marrow and brain. High-level expression of a 2-kb MEPE
transcript was detected in 4 OHO tumor samples. Rowe et al. (2000)
concluded that MEPE is a candidate gene for an OHO tumor-secreted
phosphaturic factor that may play a role in the pathophysiology of
tumor-induced osteomalacia.

Gowen et al. (2003) cloned mouse Mepe, which they called Of45. They
identified 3 early methionine codons that allow alternative start sites,
the first of which predicts a 441-amino acid protein. The mouse and
human MEPE proteins share 45% sequence identity. Northern and Western
blot analyses of mouse tissues detected expression only in bone.

Using RT-PCR, Ogbureke and Fisher (2005) found that MEPE was expressed
in normal adult human kidney. Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ
hybridization of monkey kidney revealed that Mepe was expressed
predominantly in proximal convoluted tubules.

GENE FUNCTION

Tagliabracci et al. (2012) determined that the SIBLING family of
secreted phosphoproteins are phosphorylated by FAM20C (611061), the
Golgi casein kinase that phosphorylates secretory pathway proteins with
S-x-E motifs. SIBLINGs are secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins
encoded by 5 identically oriented tandem genes clustered within an
approximately 375-kb span of nucleotides on human chromosome 4. The
genes encode osteopontin (OPN), also known as secreted phosphoprotein-1
(SPP1); dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1); bone sialoprotein (IBSP;
147563); matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE); and dentin
sialophosphoprotein (DSPP). The SIBLINGs are highly phosphorylated
proteins (DSPP has approximately 200 phosphoserines) and contain
multiple phosphorylated S-x-E/S motifs. Abnormal phosphorylation of the
SIBLINGs accounts for the biomineralization phenotype of Raine syndrome
(259775), caused by mutant FAM20C.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analysis, Rowe et al.
(2000) mapped the MEPE gene to 4q21.1, in a region where a number of
bone-tooth mineral matrix proteins are located.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gowen et al. (2003) observed that expression of mouse Of45 increased
during mineralization in osteoblast cultures, and the protein was highly
expressed within osteocytes. Gowen et al. (2003) developed a mouse model
with targeted deficiency of Of45. Ablation of Of45 resulted in increased
bone mass, and disruption of only 1 allele caused significantly
increased bone mass. Knockout mice were resistant to aging-associated
trabecular bone loss. Cancellous bone histomorphometry revealed that the
increased bone mass was the result of increased osteoblast number and
activity. Osteoclast number and surface area were unaltered. Of45
knockout osteoblasts produced significantly more mineralized nodules in
ex vivo cell cultures than did wildtype osteoblasts. Gowen et al. (2003)
concluded that Of45 plays an inhibitory role in bone formation in mouse.

610849	TITLE *610849 TUBULIN TYROSINE LIGASE-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 6; TTLL6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Polyglutamylases, such as TTLL6, catalyze polyglutamylation, a
reversible posttranslational protein modification that results in the
addition of polyglutamate chains to the C termini of tubulins (see
602529) and other proteins. Polyglutamylases also add glutamate side
chains to glutamate residues within the primary protein sequence.
Deglutamylation is catalyzed by members of the cytosolic
carboxypeptidase (CCP) family (see 606830) (summary by Rogowski et al.,
2010).

CLONING

Chen et al. (2006) noted that TTLL6 contains a TTL (608291) domain.
Based on EST database analysis, Chen et al. (2006) reported that TTLL6
has 5 potential splice variants and that it shows high expression in
testis and low expression in stomach and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Polyglutamylation of tubulin has been implicated in several functions of
microtubules. Janke et al. (2005) identified mouse neuronal Ttll1
(608955) as a tubulin polyglutamylase catalytic component. In the model
protist Tetrahymena thermophila, they characterized 2 conserved types of
polyglutamylases that differed in substrate preference and subcellular
localizations. Mouse neuronal Ttll1 and Tetrahymena Ttll1 had a
preference for alpha-tubulin (see 602529), whereas Tetrahymena Ttll6a
had a preference for beta-tubulin. Phylogenetic association of the
TTLL6, TTLL1, TTLL9, TTLL4, TTLL5 (612268), and TTLL15 protein groups
suggested that all of these proteins are important for glutamylation of
tubulin or possibly nucleosome assembly proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2006) reported that the TTLL6 gene contains 16 exons
spanning approximately 55 kb.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2006) noted that the TTLL6 gene maps to chromosome
17q21.32.

EVOLUTION

Chen et al. (2006) sequenced coding region and intronic sequences of the
TTLL6 gene in 35 human samples and 5 nonhuman primate samples.
Statistical analyses of the sequence variations observed in humans
determined that the TTLL6 gene has undergone positive selection,
resulting in accelerated evolution in humans likely due to functional
adaptation. The sites of TTLL6 under positive selection are outside of
the TTL domain and are not conserved ATP-binding sites.

610583	TITLE *610583 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; ANKRD6
;;KIAA0957;;
DIVERSIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ANKRD6, which they designated
KIAA0957. The cDNA contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime UTR. The
deduced 692-amino acid protein showed some homology with ankyrin (ANK1;
612641). RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in ovary, with low
expression in heart, whole brain, and liver, and no expression in other
adult tissues or in fetal brain and liver. In specific brain regions
examined, amygdala had moderate expression and all other brain regions
had little to no expression.

Using conductin (AXIN2; 604025) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
mouse embryo cDNA library, Schwarz-Romond et al. (2002) cloned Ankrd6,
which they called diversin. The deduced 712-amino acid protein contains
8 N-terminal ankyrin repeats, a central domain, and a C-terminal domain.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation assays and yeast 2-hybrid analysis,
Schwarz-Romond et al. (2002) showed that the central domain of mouse
diversin interacted with human casein kinase-1E (CSNK1E; 600863) and the
C-terminal domain interacted with conductin or Axin1 (603816).
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that diversin and Gsk3-beta
(GSK3B; 605004) exist in triple complexes with full-length dimeric
conductin. Schwarz-Romond et al. (2002) found that dimeric conductin
could concomitantly bind diversin and Gsk3b and that monomeric conductin
could bind either diversin or Gsk3b. Expression of diversin in human
embryonic kidney cells enhanced degradation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1;
116806), and degradation was blocked by a proteasome inhibitor. They
showed that diversin was expressed maternally in zebrafish embryos and
was involved in JNK (MAPK8; 601158) activation and gastrulation
movements. They further showed that diversin suppressed Wnt signals
mediated by the beta-catenin pathway and stimulated signaling via Jnk.
Schwarz-Romond et al. (2002) concluded that diversin is an essential
component of the Wnt signaling pathway and acts as a molecular switch.

Moeller et al. (2006) found that diversin controlled fusion of heart
precursors in zebrafish embryos in addition to controlling gastrulation
movement. Diversin directly interacted with dishevelled (DVL1; 601365)
via its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was necessary and
sufficient to mediate noncanonical Wnt signaling. Diversin also affected
planar cell polarity in Drosophila, which is controlled by the
noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ANKRD6
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP RH46749).

ANIMAL MODEL

By morpholino-based gene ablation in zebrafish, Schwarz-Romond et al.
(2002) showed that diversin was crucial for axis formation, which
depends on beta-catenin signaling.

;;DNCI2;;
IC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytoplasmic dynein is a minus end-directed microtubule motor composed of
2 catalytic heavy chains and accessory subunits, including intermediate
and light intermediate chains. The 2 Chlamydomonas flagellar dynein
intermediate chains (ICs) have been localized to the base of the dynein
complex and bind directly to the A-microtubule of the flagellar outer
doublet (Vaughan and Vallee (1995)). Paschal et al. (1992) isolated a
rat cDNA encoding IC1. Based on homology with the Chlamydomonas
flagellar dynein ICs, they proposed a role for cytoplasmic dynein ICs in
linking the motor protein to organelles and kinetochores. Vaughan and
Vallee (1995) reported the sequence of a partial cDNA encoding IC2, a
human cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain. They used the human cDNA as
a probe to isolate rat IC2 cDNAs. The predicted human and rat IC2
proteins are 94% identical. Vaughan and Vallee (1995) found that there
are multiple isoforms of rat IC1 and IC2 which are probably the result
of an alternative splicing mechanism.

Crackower et al. (1999) isolated cDNAs encoding mouse Dnci2. The
predicted protein is 99% and 77% identical to rat Dnci2 and human DNCI1
(603772), respectively. Northern blot analysis indicated that Dnci2 was
expressed broadly in all mouse tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using blot overlay and immunoprecipitation assays, Vaughan and Vallee
(1995) demonstrated that rat IC1 and IC2 interacted with the p150(Glued)
(601143) component of the dynactin complex. They suggested that dynactin
may act as a dynein receptor in a highly regulated interaction.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pazour et al. (2006) mapped the DNCI2 gene
to chromosome 2q31.1.

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, Vaughan et al. (1996) mapped
the mouse Dnci2 gene to chromosome 2.

;;INOSITOL-REQUIRING ENZYME 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, BETA; IRE1B;;
IRE1-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Various noxious circumstances lead to the accumulation of unfolded
protein intermediates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trigger a
stress response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In
mammalian cells, the UPR induces transcription of genes encoding ER
protein chaperones, such as BiP (138120). ER stress activates other
pathways, including the expression of the CHOP (126337) transcription
factor, and is also linked to the development of programmed cell death.
In S. cerevisiae, the ER-associated transmembrane Ire1
(inositol-requiring-1)/Ern1 protein kinase is the UPR proximal sensor
that monitors the status of unfolded protein inside the ER lumen. Wang
et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding a mouse Ire1 homolog, which they
called mIre1 or Ern2. Like yeast Ire1, the predicted mouse Ern2 protein
is a putative type I transmembrane protein and contains a C-terminal
kinase/endonuclease effector domain. The C-terminal regions of Ire1 and
Ern2 are 40% identical. When expressed in mammalian cells, Ern2
localized to the ER. Overexpression activated both BiP and CHOP
expression, and also led to the development of programmed cell death.
Wang et al. (1998) concluded that a single upstream component, Ern2,
plays a role in multiple facets of the ER stress response in mammalian
cells. Wang et al. (1998) identified a partial cDNA encoding human ERN2.
They noted that ERN2 is distinct from ERN1 (604033), a second human Ire1
homolog.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Wang et al. (1998) mapped the
ERN2 gene to mouse chromosome 7 and to human chromosome 16, in regions
that show homology of synteny. The authors determined that the human
ERN2 gene is located 55 bp from the PLK (602098) gene in a tail-to-tail
configuration.

;;GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR RECEPTOR, LOW AFFINITY,
ALPHA SUBUNIT; GMCSFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF, or CSF2;
138960) activates STAT5 (601511) and other signaling pathways via
binding to a cell surface receptor composed of a ligand-binding alpha
subunit, encoded by CSF2RA, and a nonbinding affinity-enhancing beta
subunit, encoded by CSF2RB (138981) (Suzuki et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using an expression cloning strategy, Gearing et al. (1989) isolated a
cDNA encoding CSF2RA, which they called GMCSFR, from a human placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 400-amino acid precursor protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide. The 378-amino acid mature protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 43.7 kD and contains a single transmembrane
domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain, and a short
intracytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis detected GMCSFR expression
in a variety of hemopoietic cells displaying GMCSF binding.

Raines et al. (1991) identified a truncated, soluble form of the
low-affinity GMCSF receptor in choriocarcinoma cells. Clones encoding
the soluble receptor were identical in sequence to the membrane-bound
form except for a 97-nucleotide deletion. The amino acid sequence of
this deleted cDNA predicted a protein that lacks the 84 C-terminal amino
acids of the membrane-bound receptor, including the transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains, and contains 16 different amino acids at its C
terminus. RNase protection analysis indicated that this variant cDNA was
derived from a naturally occurring mRNA. Soluble receptors had been
identified for several other hematopoietin receptors and may be a
general feature of this class. It is likely that alternative mRNA
splicing is the mechanism by which the soluble counterparts are
generated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rappold et al. (1992) found that the CSF2RA gene spans at least 45 kb.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of a panel of mouse-human somatic cell
hybrids, Gough et al. (1990) demonstrated that the CSF2R gene is on the
X chromosome. The possibility that an allele also maps to the Y
chromosome was suggested by the observation that many DNA samples from
normal males carry 2 alleles of this gene. Among 65 normal persons, 23
females and 20 males were homozygous for an allele of fragment A,
whereas 8 females and 14 males were heterozygous. By in situ
hybridization, Gough et al. (1990) showed that the CSF2R gene maps to
the tip of the short arm of the X chromosome and the short arm of the Y
chromosome (see 425000), with the most likely localization being
Xpter-p21 and Ypter-p11.2. Although this information was consistent with
its location in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), conclusive proof
required study of segregation of the locus with respect to sexual
phenotype. They found in a total of 14 informative male meioses, 3
recombination events; i.e., in 2 cases a daughter had inherited the
allele from the paternal Y chromosome, and in 1 instance a son had
inherited the allele from the paternal X chromosome. Thus, the CSF2R
locus is distal to the MIC2 locus (313470), which shows only about 2.5%
recombination and maps close to the PAR boundary. This was the first
localization of a gene of known function to this region, which
encompasses about 2,500 kb.

By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Rappold et al. (1992) localized the
CSF2RA gene 1,180 to 1,300 kb from the telomere, in close proximity to
the CpG island B5. The gene showed abundant hypervariable sequences, and
a number of informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms were
defined. Rappold et al. (1992) suggested that these polymorphisms might
be useful in proving the pseudoautosomal inheritance of apparently
autosomal traits, as has been suggested for schizophrenia (Crow, 1988),
cerebral dominance (Crow, 1989), and Kabuki make-up syndrome (Niikawa et
al., 1988; 147920), among others.

Rappold (1993) discussed in detail the pseudoautosomal regions that
exist at the tips of the short and long arms of the X and Y chromosomes
and cover 2.6 and 0.4 Mb, respectively.

By both in situ hybridization and linkage analysis, Disteche et al.
(1992) found that the murine Csf2ra gene maps to chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPersio et al. (1988) studied the binding of GMCSF, over a wide range
of concentrations, to normal human peripheral blood cells, bone marrow,
acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and a number of established
human myeloid and nonmyeloid cell lines; thereby, they defined the
receptors.

Gearing et al. (1989) found that transfection of GMCSFR cDNA into COS
cells directed expression of a GMCSF receptor showing a single class of
affinity and specificity for human GMCSF, but not interleukin-3 (IL3;
147740).

Hayashida et al. (1990) showed that the high-affinity GMCSF receptor is
composed of at least 2 components in a manner analogous to the IL2
receptor (see 147730). They proposed to designate the low-affinity GMCSF
receptor as the alpha subunit, and the 'new' protein that they
identified and called KH97 as the beta subunit (see 138981). The 2
subunits are approximately 80 and 120 kD, respectively.

Raines et al. (1991) found that expression of the variant cDNA encoding
the truncated, soluble CSF2R isoform produced a secreted protein that
retained its capacity to bind CSF2 in solution.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the
beta-chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and
monocyte differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic
domains, showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these
unique developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al.
(2000) showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for
GMCSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are
expressed at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic
stem cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are
upregulated after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et
al. (2000) concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate
decisions and proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is
downregulation of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell
development.

Loss of either the X or the Y chromosome is apparent in 25% of acute
myeloid leukemias of the M2 subtype (AML-M2), compared with only 1 to 6%
in other AML subtypes, suggesting the involvement of a 'recessive
oncogene' in the genesis of M2 AMLs. The presumed gene is likely to be
in the PAR, because if it were located in the portion of the X
chromosome not shared with the Y, then similar loss of the Y chromosome
would not be predicted, and vice versa. Gough et al. (1990) suggested
that CSF2R may be the gene in question. Loss or inactivation of both
copies of the gene in a myeloid progenitor cell would be expected to
result in a clone of cells unable to respond to GMCSF, and hence in the
relatively undifferentiated phenotype of the M2 form of leukemia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which
surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary
alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. It is a disorder of
surfactant metabolism. The importance of CSF2 in the pathogenesis of PAP
has been confirmed in humans and mice, wherein CSF2 signaling is
required for pulmonary alveolar macrophage catabolism of surfactant.
Using flow cytometry, Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) found that
CSF2RA was absent on monocytes from a 4-year-old girl with PAP due to
pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP4; 300770). The
patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas the
patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation of
monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 induced upregulation of
CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the patient. Karyotypic
analysis showed that the patient had 1 X chromosome of apparently normal
length and 1 X chromosome with a truncated Xp arm that did not hybridize
with a PAR1 probe. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in
leukocytes from the patient's family members, but not in those from the
patient. PCR analysis of the 11 coding exons of the CSF2RA gene revealed
a deletion of exons 5 through 13 (306250.0001) in the patient's DNA,
providing a genetic basis for the absence of CSF2RA mRNA and protein.

Using flow cytometry, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both CSF2RA and
CSF2RB were present on leukocytes from 2 sisters with PAP, as well as
all family members tested. However, Western blot analysis showed that
the affected sisters expressed only a truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas
their father was heterozygous for the normal and truncated forms, and
their mother expressed only normal CSF2RA. CSF2 binding and
CSF2-dependent signaling were severely reduced, but not abolished, in
the sisters, and their CD11B stimulation test was abnormal. Suzuki et
al. (2008) identified a mutation in the CSF2RA gene in the affected
sisters that resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R; 306250.0002)
substitution. The father was heterozygous for the G174R mutation, but
the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed that CSF2RA
copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but not in the
father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of PAR1, including
the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome of the sisters and mother. Suzuki et
al. (2008) concluded that PAP may be caused by compound heterozygous
abnormalities affecting the CSF2RA gene, and that CSF2 signaling is
critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schweizerhof et al. (2009) presented evidence that GCSF (CSF3; 138970)
and GMCSF mediate bone cancer pain and tumor-nerve interactions.
Increased levels of both factors were detected in bone marrow lysates
and adjoining connective tissue in a mouse sarcoma model of bone
tumor-induced pain compared to controls. The functional receptors GCSFR
(CSF3R; 138971) and GMCSFR were expressed on peripheral nerves in the
bone matrix and in dorsal root ganglia. GMCSF sensitized nerves to
mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP (114130)
release, and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. RNA
interference of GCSF and GMCSF signaling in the mouse sarcoma model led
to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer
pain.

In a 4-year-old girl with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (300770),
Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) identified a deletion of exons 5
through 13 in the CSF2RA gene. Karyotypic analysis showed that the
patient's other X chromosome had a truncated Xp arm that did not
hybridize with a probe for pseudoautosomal region-1, which contains
CSF2RA. The patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas
the patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation
of monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 (1389060) induced
upregulation of CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the
patient. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in leukocytes
from the patient's family members, but not in those from the patient.

Suzuki et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the
CSF2RA gene in genomic DNA from 2 sisters with pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis (300770), one 6 years of age and the other 8 years of age.
The mutation resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R) substitution that
altered 1 of 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the CSF2RA protein.
Western blot analysis showed that the affected sisters expressed only a
truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas their father was heterozygous for the
normal and truncated forms, and their mother expressed only normal
CSF2RA. CSF2 (138960) binding and CSF2-dependent signaling were severely
reduced, but not abolished, in the sisters, and their CD11B (120980)
stimulation test was abnormal. The father was heterozygous for the G174R
mutation, but the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed
that CSF2RA copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but
not in the father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of
pseudoautosomal region-1, including the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome
of the sisters and mother. Transfection of CSF2RA with the G174R
mutation into 293 cells reproduced the CSF2 signaling defect at
physiologic CSF2 concentrations. At high CSF2 concentrations, similar to
those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued,
thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow disease
progression in the 2 sisters.

604464	TITLE *604464 INTERSECTIN 2; ITSN2
;;SH3 DOMAIN PROTEIN 1B; SH3D1B;;
SWA;;
KIAA1256
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intersection-2 is an Src homology-3 (SH3)-containing protein involved in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Pucharcos et al., 2000).

CLONING

By screening a human prostate cancer cell line cDNA expression library
with an SH3 ligand peptide, Sparks et al. (1996) isolated several cDNAs
encoding SH3 domain-containing proteins, including SH3D1B (ITSN2), which
they called SH3P18. The partial SH3D1B cDNA encodes a predicted
adaptor-like protein containing at least 3 SH3 domains. SH3 domains are
60-amino acid regions of limited sequence similarity among a number of
signaling and cytoskeletal proteins. Despite their modest similarity,
SH3 domains share a common function: they mediate protein-protein
interactions by binding short proline-rich regions in target proteins.
Each SH3 domain selects peptides sharing a different consensus motif,
indicating that different SH3 domains prefer ligands with distinct
sequence characteristics (summary by Sparks et al., 1996).

By EST database searching with ITSN1 (602442) as a template, followed by
RT-PCR and RACE analysis of human brain and liver tissues, Pucharcos et
al. (2000) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ITSN2. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 1,696-amino acid protein possesses 2 EH domains, a
coiled-coil region, 5 consecutive central SH3 domains in the short
isoform, and C-terminal DH, PH, and C2 domains in the long isoform.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of 10-, 8-, and
6.5-kb transcripts, with the longer transcript primarily expressed in
adult heart and liver. Western blot analysis showed that expressed
tagged long and short ITSN2 migrated in agreement with their predicted
molecular weights of 193- and 142-kD, respectively. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated sparse punctate expression throughout the
cytoplasm for both ITSN1 and ITSN2, with ITSN1 having a more marked
perinuclear pattern and a concentration in Golgi-like structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Pucharcos et al. (2000) found that overexpression of either of the ITSN2
isoforms or ITSN1 resulted in the inhibition of transferrin uptake and
the blockage of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin-mediated
endocytosis occurs in coated vesicles at the plasma membrane and is
critical in synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons and in the
internalization of receptor-ligand complexes. The main component of
clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) is the CLTC (118955), which associates
with the smaller CLTA (118960) to form triskelions that organize
themselves into a caged lattice forming the scaffold of nascent CCV.
Pucharcos et al. (2000) concluded that ITSN1 and ITSN2 have a great
variety of interacting domains and likely act as scaffolding proteins in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

MAPPING

Scott (2001) mapped the ITSN2 gene to chromosome 2 based on sequence
similarity between the ITSN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF182198) and
chromomome 2 clones (GenBank GENBANK AC008073 and GENBANK AC009228).

603925	TITLE *603925 SYNAPTOGYRIN 1; SYNGR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rat synaptogyrin, or RATSYNGR1, is an integral membrane protein
associated with presynaptic vesicles in neuronal cells. See SYNGR2
(603926). As part of an effort to sequence the long arm of human
chromosome 22, Kedra et al. (1998) identified the human homolog of
RATSYNGR1, synaptogyrin-1 (SYNGR1). By a combination of EST database
searching and library screening, the authors isolated cDNAs
corresponding to 3 alternatively spliced transcripts, which they
designated SYNGR1a-c. The predicted 1a, 1b, and 1c proteins contain 234,
191, and 192 amino acids, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed
that the 4.5-kb SYNGR1a mRNA is expressed at high levels in brain. The
other transcript forms are expressed at low levels in nonneuronal
tissues. In situ hybridization to embryonic and adult mouse tissues
confirmed that SYNGR1a, the most abundant transcript form, shows
predominantly neuronal expression. Kedra et al. (1998) also identified
cDNAs encoding the related human proteins SYNGR2 and SYNGR3 (603927) and
mouse Syngr1b. Like RATSYNGR1, the mouse and human synaptogyrin family
members contain 4 membrane-spanning domains. The conserved central
portion of SYNGR1a shares 54%, 61%, and 92% identity with that of
SYNGR2, SYNGR3, and RATSYNGR1, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kedra et al. (1998) determined that the SYNGR1 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By inclusion within mapped clones, Kedra et al. (1998) mapped the SYNGR1
gene to chromosome 22q13. These authors found that SYNGR2 is located on
17qter and noted that the synaptogyrins and several other gene families
contain paralogous genes located on chromosomes 17 and 22. They stated
that this result supports the hypothesis that 17q and 22q are
evolutionarily closely related, and that these 2 regions in the human
genome are the result of a large chromosome duplication.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting, Janz et al. (1999) generated mice lacking Syngr1.
They bred these Syngr1 knockout mice against Syp (313475) knockout mice
generated by McMahon et al. (1996) to create double knockout mice
deficient in both Syp and Syngr1. Both single and double knockout mice
were viable and fertile. Morphologic and biochemical analysis showed
that the architecture and composition of synapses were unaltered in the
brains of Syngr1 single knockout and Syngr1/Syp double knockout mutant
mice. Electrophysiologic recordings in the hippocampal CA1 region
revealed that short- and long-term synaptic plasticity was severely
reduced in the Syngr1/Syp double knockout mice without changes in the
fundamental release apparatus, vesicle cycling, or release probability.
Janz et al. (1999) concluded that Syngr1 and Syp perform essential and
redundant functions in synaptic plasticity without being required for
synaptic transmission as such.

From the results of cotransfection experiments, Janz et al. (1999)
concluded that Syp and Syngr1 are phosphorylated by c-fyn and c-src
tyrosine kinases. The absence of Syp and Syngr1 in knockout mice did not
markedly affect tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins.

606489	TITLE *606489 EXOSOME COMPONENT 3; EXOSC3
;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 40, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP40
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EXOSC3 gene encodes a core component of the human RNA exosome
complex that is present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus and especially
enriched in the nucleolus (Brouwer et al., 2001).

CLONING

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein (606488);
p9, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10,
which is homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein; p11, which is homologous
to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the yeast
Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast Csl4
protein (606493). They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast exosome components,
followed by PCR on a teratocarcinoma cell line and 5-prime RACE using
placenta RNA, Brouwer et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs encoding RRP40,
RRP41, and RRP46. The deduced 275-amino acid RRP40 protein is 88% and
30% identical to the mouse and yeast sequences, respectively. Western
blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy showed expression of a
31-kD protein in the nucleus, with additional forms expressed in the
cytoplasm and the highest concentration in nucleolus.

There are multiple alternatively spliced forms of EXOSC3, with the
longest reading frame encoding a 275-residue protein (summary by Wan et
al., 2012).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wan et al. (2012) stated that the EXOSC3 gene contains 4 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Functional analysis by Brouwer et al. (2001) supported the conclusion
that RRP40 is present in human exosomes in a complex displaying
3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 families with autosomal recessive
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1B (PCH1B; 614678), Wan et al. (2012)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the EXOSC3
gene (see, e.g., 606489.0001-606489.0005). The first mutation was
identified by genomewide scan and exome sequencing of a family with 4
affected brothers. The phenotype was severe and characterized by a
combination of cerebellar and spinal motor neuron degeneration beginning
at birth. There was diffuse muscle weakness, progressive microcephaly,
global and developmental delay, and brainstem involvement. The findings
indicated that proper RNA processing is important for the development
and survival of cerebellar and spinal motor neurons.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wan et al. (2012) found that morpholino knockdown of Exosc3 in zebrafish
embryos caused embryonic maldevelopment, with small brain size,
particularly in the hindbrain, a short and curved spine, and poor
motility. There was diminished expression of dorsal hindbrain
progenitor-specific markers and cerebellar-specific markers compared to
controls. The defects were largely rescued by coinjection with wildtype
zebrafish Exosc3 mRNA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 1B
EXOSC3, ASP132ALA

In 4 brothers from a family of American and European ancestry with
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1B (PCH1B; 614678), Wan et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 395A-C transversion in exon 2 of the EXOSC3
gene, resulting in an asp132-to-ala (D132A) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the putative RNA-binding S1 domain, which may be
important for intersubunit interaction within the exosome complex. The
mutation was identified by genomewide scan and exome sequencing, and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Sequencing of this gene identified the
same homozygous mutation in affected individuals from 3 additional
families with the disorder; 2 of these families were consanguineous.
Haplotype analysis of 3 of the families with a homozygous D132A mutation
was consistent with a remote common ancestor. Affected individuals in 3
additional families carried the D132A mutation in compound
heterozygosity with another pathogenic mutation in the EXOSC3 gene (see,
e.g., 606489.0002 and 606489.0003). All available unaffected parents
were heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, which were not found in 379
control individuals. The phenotype consisted of neonatal onset of severe
hypotonia, often with respiratory insufficiency, and global
developmental delay, without achieving any motor milestones or speech,
and progressive microcephaly. Other features included oculomotor
apraxia, progressive muscle wasting, and distal contractures. Brain MRI
showed marked cerebellar and pontine atrophy. Postmortem examination
showed severe loss of cerebellar and spinal motor neurons.

PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 1B
EXOSC3, ALA139PRO

In an 11-month-old Australian boy with PCH1B (614678), Wan et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the EXOSC3 gene: a
415G-C transition in exon 2 resulting in an ala139-to-pro (A139P)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the RNA-binding S1 domain,
and D132A (606489.0001). Neither mutation was found in 379 control
individuals.

.0003
PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 1B
EXOSC3, 10-BP DEL, NT294

In a boy from New Caldonia with PCH1B (614678), Wan et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the EXOSC3 gene: a
10-bp deletion (294_303del) in exon 1, predicted to result in premature
truncation (99fs*11) or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and D132A
(606489.0001). Neither mutation was found in 379 control individuals.

.0004
PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 1B
EXOSC3, GLY31ALA

In 2 Czech sibs with PCH1B (614678), Wan et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the EXOSC3 gene: a 92G-C
transversion in exon 1, resulting in a gly31-to-ala (G31A) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the N-terminal domain, and a 712T-C
transition in exon 4, resulting in a trp238-to-arg (W238R; 606489.0005)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the putative RNA-binding
KH domain. Another unrelated Czech boy with the disorder was homozygous
for the G31A mutation. Neither mutation was found in 379 control
individuals.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NQO1 (EC 1.6.5.2) is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the 2-electron
reduction of various quinones and redox dyes, such as phyloquinone and
the vitamin K menadione (Jaiswal et al., 1988).

CLONING

Using rat Nmor1 to probe a liver cDNA library, Jaiswal et al. (1988)
cloned human NMOR1. The deduced 274-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 30.9 kD and shares 85% identity with rat cytosolic
Nmor1. Northern blot analysis of normal human liver and HepG2 human
hepatoblastoma cells revealed transcripts of 1.2, 1.7, and 2.7 kb that
appeared to differ only in the lengths of their 3-prime UTRs.

Using Northern blot analysis, Jaiswal (1994) detected variable
expression of 1.2- and 2.7-kb NQO1 transcripts in all human tissues
examined. Both transcripts showed highest expression in kidney, followed
by skeletal muscle and lung. Lowest expression was detected in pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Jaiswal et al. (1988) showed that tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)
treatment of HepG2 cells produced a 5-fold induction of NMOR1 activity.
TCDD predominantly induced transcription of the 2.7-kb NMOR mRNA.

Edwards et al. (1983) showed that the quantitative polymorphism of DIA4
can be attributed to the segregation of a 'low activity' allele. In 4 to
6% of persons there is a DIA4-absent phenotype. In a series of
human/hamster hybrids, made using a human parental cell heterozygous for
both phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP; 172280) and DIA4, the low
activity allele and the PGP(2) allele cosegregated except in 2 of 16
discordant hybrids. DIA4 is presumably the same as NAD(P)H:menadione
oxidoreductase (NMOR1).

GENE STRUCTURE

Jaiswal et al. (1988) determined that the 3-prime end of the NQO1 gene
contains 4 polyadenylation signal sequences, with an Alu repetitive
sequence between polyadenylation sites 2 and 3.

Jaiswal (1991) determined that the NQO1 gene contains 6 coding exons and
spans about 20 kb.

MAPPING

By study of man-mouse somatic cell hybrids, Grzeschik (1980) and Povey
et al. (1980) identified a fourth diaphorase locus (DIA4) which
segregates with chromosome 16. The regional assignment was 16q12-q22
(smallest region of overlap, SRO).

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids, Jaiswal et al. (1988) demonstrated that the single-copy NMOR1
gene maps to chromosome 16, consistent with the assignment of DIA4 to
that chromosome.

Using mouse/human somatic cell hybrids containing rearranged chromosome
16 together with multiple probes, Chen et al. (1991) assigned the NMOR1
locus to 16q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

NQO1 is a 2-electron reductase that detoxifies quinones derived from the
oxidation of phenolic metabolites of benzene. Individuals homozygous for
the T/T form of the 609C-T polymorphism (125860.0001) have an increased
risk of benzene hematotoxicity. Moran et al. (1999) used a human
promyeloblastic cell line to investigate the ability of the benzene
metabolite hydroquinone (HQ) to induce NQO1. The concentration-dependent
induction of NQO1 protein and activity was observed in these cells when
cultured with HQ. Multiple detoxification systems, including NQO1 and
glutathione, protect against benzene metabolite-induced toxicity.
Indeed, exposure to a noncytotoxic concentration of HQ induced both NQO1
and soluble thiols and protected against HQ-induced apoptosis. Wildtype
human bone marrow cells (homozygous for 609C), when exposed to HQ,
showed an increase in NQO1 protein and activity, whereas no NQO1 was
induced by HQ in bone marrow cells with the T/T genotype. Intermediate
induction of NQO1 by HQ was observed in heterozygous bone marrow cells
(C/T). nQO1 also was induced by HQ in wildtype (C/C) human bone marrow
CD34(+) progenitor cells. The data suggested that failure to induce
functional NQO1 may contribute to the increased risk of benzene
poisoning in individuals homozygous for the 609C-T substitution.

Millstein et al. (2006) developed an efficient testing strategy called
the 'focused interaction testing framework' (FITF) to identify
susceptibility genes involved in epistatic interactions useful in
case-control studies of candidate genes. In an application to asthma
(see 600807) case-control data from the Children's Health Study, FITF
identified a significant multilocus effect between the NQO1 gene, the
myeloperoxidase gene (MPO; 606989), and the catalase gene (CAT; 115500),
3 genes that are involved in the oxidative stress pathway. In an
independent dataset consisting primarily of African American and Asian
American children, these 3 genes also showed a significant association
with asthma status (P = 0.0008).

Fagerholm et al. (2008) found that the common NQO1 missense variant
P187S (125860.0001) (dbSNP rs1800566) in homozygosity disables NQO1 and
strongly predicted poor survival among 2 independent series of women
with breast cancer (P = 0.002, N = 1,005; P = 0.005, N = 1,162), an
effect particularly evident after anthracycline-based adjuvant
chemotherapy with epirubicin (P = 7.52 x 10(-6)) and in p53-aberrant
tumors (P = 6.15 x 10(-5)). Survival after metastasis was reduced among
NQO1*2 homozygotes, further implicating NQO1 deficiency in cancer
progression and treatment resistance. Consistently, response to
epirubicin was impaired in NQO1*2-homozygous breast carcinoma cells, in
vitro, reflecting both p53-linked and p53-independent roles of NQO1.
Fagerholm et al. (2008) proposed a model of defective anthracycline
response in NQO1-deficient breast tumors, along with increased genomic
instability promoted by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and
suggested that the NQO1 genotype is a prognostic and predictive marker
for breast cancer.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Radjendirane et al. (1998) generated Nqo1-null mice by targeted
disruption. Mice lacking NQO1 gene expression were indistinguishable
from wildtype mice. However, Nqo1-null mice exhibited increased toxicity
when administered menadione compared with wildtype mice. These results
established a role for NQO1 in protection against quinone toxicity.

NQO1, PRO187SER

Traver et al. (1992, 1997) characterized a polymorphism in NQO1, a
C-to-T substitution at position 609 of NQO1 cDNA, which codes for a
proline-to-serine change at residue 187 (P187S). In cells with a T/T
genotype, NQO1 activity was not detected, and lack of activity
corresponded to a lack of NQO1 protein.

Kelsey et al. (1997) found that the prevalence of the T/T genotype
varied among ethnic groups from 4 to 20%, with the highest prevalence
occurring in Asian populations.

Rothman et al. (1997) reported a case-control study of benzene-exposed
workers in China showing an increased risk of hematotoxicity in
individuals with the T/T NQO1 genotype. A protective role for NQO1
against benzene-derived quinones in bone marrow in situ required
reconciling with the observation that freshly isolated bone marrow
mononuclear and progenitor cells failed to express NQO1. Moran et al.
(1999) showed that exposure to benzene metabolites does not induce NQO1
in individuals of the T/T genotype as it does in persons with the C/C
genotype, and induces NQO1 to an intermediate degree in persons with the
T/C genotype.

Synthetic antioxidants and extracts of cruciferous vegetables, including
broccoli (Benson et al., 1980), are potent inducers of NQO1. Given the
association between lack of NQO1 activity, benzene toxicity, and
subsequent risk of benzene-induced leukemia, Smith (1999) decided to
investigate the role of the 609C-to-T polymorphism in leukemia in
general. With colleagues, he studied a series of 104 leukemia cases from
the Chicago area, more than half of which represented myeloid leukemia
secondary to chemotherapy. The mutant allele frequency was 1.4-fold
higher than expected in the post-therapy AML cases and was 1.6-fold
higher among patients with abnormalities in chromosomes 5 and/or 7.
Zhang et al. (1998) had shown that benzene increases abnormalities in
chromosomes 5 and 7 in exposed workers, and hydroquinone produces
similar changes in cultured human cells (Zhang et al., 1998). Thus, lack
of or lowered NQO1 activity may make individuals vulnerable to leukemia
secondary to chemical exposure.

Fagerholm et al. (2008) found that homozygosity for the T/T genotype of
NQO1 (NQO1*2, dbSNP rs1800566T) strongly predicted poor survival among 2
independent series of women with breast cancer (114480) (P = 0.002, N =
1,005; P = 0.005, N = 1,162), an effect particularly evident after
anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin (P = 7.52 x
10(-6)) and in p53 (191170)-aberrant tumors (P = 6.15 x 10(-5)).

602428	TITLE *602428 HYALURONAN SYNTHASE 3; HAS3
DESCRIPTION For background information on hyaluronan (HA) and HA synthases, such as
HAS3, see HAS1 (601463).

CLONING

By degenerate PCR, Spicer et al. (1997) isolated a genomic fragment of
human HAS3 and genomic and cDNA clones of mouse Has3. The amino acid
sequences encoded by the partial human HAS3 fragment and the
corresponding region of mouse Has3 are 99% conserved. The authors noted
that the high degree of sequence conservation between specific human and
mouse HASs contrasts with the lower level of identity between HASs
within a species, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of
functionally important residues and differences in the mode of action of
the various HASs. The predicted 554-amino acid mouse Has3 protein has
several consensus HA-binding motifs and multiple transmembrane domains,
with 2 at the N terminus and a cluster at the C terminus. Northern blot
analysis of the mouse embryo showed that Has3 is predominantly expressed
at late gestation as a major, approximately 6.0- to 6.5-kb transcript
and a minor, approximately 4.0-kb transcript.

Monslow et al. (2003) identified a splice variant of human HAS3.

GENE FUNCTION

Spicer et al. (1997) found that expression of mouse Has3 in COS-1 cells
led to high levels of HA biosynthesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monslow et al. (2003) determined that the HAS3 gene has 4 exons and
spans about 12.5 kb. Exons 1 and 4 are subject to alternative splicing.
HAS3 has 2 promoter regions, and the 500-bp region upstream of each
transcription start site contains either 46 or 56 transcription
factor-binding sites. Upstream of exon 1 is a (GT)n repeat sequence.

MAPPING

By PCR screening somatic cell hybrid DNAs and a YAC contig, Spicer et
al. (1997) localized the human HAS3 gene to chromosome 16q22.1. By
interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse Has3 gene to
chromosome 8. Since HAS1 (601463), HAS2 (601636), and HAS3 are located
on different autosomes, Spicer et al. (1997) suggested that the HAS gene
family arose comparatively early in vertebrate evolution by sequential
duplication of an ancestral HAS gene.

614184	TITLE *614184 DIS3 MITOTIC CONTROL, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE 2; DIS3L2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA exosome is an approximately 400-kD multimeric ribonucleolytic
complex that participates in both endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime
exonucleolytic activity in RNA processing and in the degradation of a
variety of RNA substrates. DIS3L2 shares high sequence similarity with
catalytic exosome subunits that have 3-prime/5-prime exonucleolytic
activity (summary by Tomecki et al., 2010).

CLONING

By searching the human genomic database for sequences similar to DIS3L
(614183), Staals et al. (2010) identified 5 potential splice variants of
DIS3L2. The longest deduced protein contains 885 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 99.2 kD. It has a poorly conserved
N-terminal PIN domain, followed by a cold-shock domain, a putative RNB
exonuclease catalytic domain, and a possible C-terminal S1 RNA-binding
domain.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DIS3L2 gene to chromosome 2q37.2 based on an
alignment of the DIS3L2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC030113) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

In transfected COS-7 and HeLa cells, Astuti et al. (2012) observed that
DIS3L2 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. RNA degradation
assays using transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that DIS3L2 has
exonuclease activity. Knockdown studies in HeLa cells showed that DIS3L2
inactivation was associated with mitotic abnormalities and altered
expression of mitotic checkpoint proteins, with lowered expression of
TTK (604092), aurora B (AURKB; 604970), and phosphorylated CDC25C
(157680), but upregulation of cyclin B1 (CCNB1; 123836), RAD21 (606462),
and securin (PTTG1; 604147). DIS3L2 overexpression suppressed the growth
of human cancer cell lines, and knockdown enhanced the growth of those
cells. Astuti et al. (2012) concluded that DIS3L2 has a critical role in
RNA metabolism and is essential for the regulation of cell growth and
division.

The pluripotency factor LIN28 (611043) blocks the expression of LET7
(605386) microRNAs in undifferentiated cells during development by
binding to pre-LET7 RNAs and recruiting RNA uridyltransferases ZCCHC11
(613692) and ZCCHC6 to uridylate pre-LET7. The identity of the RNase
that degrades uridylated pre-LET7 was unknown. Chang et al. (2013)
identified Dis3l2 as the 3-prime-5-prime exonuclease responsible for the
decay of uridylated pre-let7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Biochemical
reconstitution assays showed that 3-prime oligouridylation stimulates
Dis3l2 activity in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic
stem cells leads to the stabilization of pre-let7. Chang et al. (2013)
concluded that their study established 3-prime oligouridylation as an
RNA decay signal for DIS3L2 and identified the first physiologic RNA
substrate of this exonuclease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 8 affected individuals from 6 families with Perlman syndrome (PRLMNS;
267000), Astuti et al. (2012) identified homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the DIS3L2 gene
(614184.0001-614184.0004).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, 82.8-KB DEL, EX6DEL

In a brother and sister from a consanguineous Pakistani family with
Perlman syndrome (267000), Astuti et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for an 82.8-kb deletion (367-41553_602+40962del) between exons 5 and 7
of the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in a truncated protein of 258 amino acids.
Functional studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that mutant DIS3L2
lacking exon 6 had substantially reduced ribonuclease activity. The
mutation segregated with disease in the family and was not found in at
least 300 ancestrally matched samples. The brother died at 3.5 years of
age and the sister at 2 months of age.

.0002
PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, 22-KB DEL, EX9DEL

In 3 patients from 2 Dutch families with Perlman syndrome (267000),
previously reported by Henneveld et al. (1999), as well as an unrelated
Dutch infant with this syndrome, Astuti et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for an approximately 22-kb deletion (951-?_1124+?del)
between exons 8 and 10 of the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in loss of the RNB
domain (gln318_arg375del). Functional studies in HEK293 cells
demonstrated that mutant DIS3L2 lacking exon 9 had substantially reduced
ribonuclease activity. The mutation segregated with disease in both
families and was not found in at least 300 ancestrally matched samples.
All 4 Dutch patients died in infancy. In addition, in a cell line from a
30-week amniotic fluid sample from a male patient with Perlman syndrome,
the exon 9 deletion was found in compound heterozygosity with a 1466G-A
transition in the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in a cys489-to-tyr (C489Y;
614184.0003) substitution at a highly conserved residue.

PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, IVS19, G-A, +5

In a cell line taken from a 14-year-old girl with Perlman syndrome
(267000), previously reported by Neri et al. (1984), Astuti et al.
(2012) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in exon 19
(2394+5G-A) of the DIS3L2 gene, predicted to cause skipping or deletion
of exon 19. The mutation segregated with disease in the family and was
not found in at least 300 ancestrally matched control samples. Although
a second mutation was not detected, only the transcript lacking exon 19
was found, suggesting the presence of another mutation that might
abolish transcription or cause mRNA instability.

602887	TITLE *602887 DISCS LARGE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 4; DLG4
;;POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY 95; PSD95;;
SYNAPSE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 90; SAP90
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DLG4 belongs to the discs large (DLG) subfamily of the
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family (see DLG1; 601014).
DLG4 interacts with both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (see
138249) and Shaker-type potassium channels (see 176260) and plays an
important role in the formation and maintenance of synaptic junctions
(Zhou and Blumberg, 2003).

CLONING

Proteins related to Drosophila 'discs large' (Dlg) are associated with
the cortical actin cytoskeleton and appear to have both structural and
functional roles. By screening a human mammary gland cDNA library with a
human EST showing homology to rat Psd95, which is also known as Sap90
(Kistner et al., 1993), Stathakis et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding
DLG4, which they called PSD95. The predicted 723-amino acid DLG4 protein
has 3 PSD95-DLG-Z01 (PDZ) domains in its N-terminal half, a central src
homology-3 (SH3) motif, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase
(GUK)-homologous domain. The human DLG4 protein is 99% identical to the
rat and mouse Psd95 proteins and 56% identical to the Drosophila Dlg
protein. Northern blot analysis detected 6 DLG4 transcripts with
different expression patterns, including a 4.2-kb transcript that was
variably expressed in all 17 human tissues examined. Western blot
analysis using antibodies against DLG4 detected multiple proteins with
complex distribution patterns, including a ubiquitous 85-kD and
tissue-specific variants.

By examining human brain, mammary gland, pancreas, and testis cDNA
libraries, Stathakis et al. (1999) identified 3 splice variants of DLG4.
A transcript lacking exon 3 was detected in brain, but not in other
tissues. This variant introduces an early frameshift and encodes a
predicted 45-amino acid peptide. However, a downstream ORF from exons 4
through 22 has the potential to encode a 664-amino acid protein
containing all functional domains of DLG4, with a single residue before
the first PDZ domain. A variant lacking exon 20 was detected in mammary
gland and testis, but not in brain or pancreas. This variant encodes a
deduced 670-amino acid protein that lacks part of the C-terminal GUK
domain. A variant containing a 99-nucleotide extension of exon 4 (exon
4b) was detected in testis, but not in other tissues. This variant
encodes a deduced 803-amino acid protein with 33 additional amino acids
inserted before the first PDZ domain.

Zhou and Blumberg (2003) stated that the N terminus of DLG4 is modified
by thioester-linked palmitate, which targets the protein to cell
membranes. Palmitoylation is also a critical regulatory mechanism for
receptor interactions with DLG4. Real-time RT-PCR detected DLG4
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in brain,
followed by heart, placenta, lung, pancreas, spleen, thymus, testis,
ovary, and small intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

The proper distribution of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels
on the neuronal surface is critical for the processing and transmission
of electrical signals in neurons. Kim et al. (1995) and Kim et al.
(1996) demonstrated that PSD95 and chapsyn-110 (603583) mediated
clustering of both NMDA receptors and potassium channels. Chapsyn-110
and PSD95 heteromultimerized with each other and were recruited into the
same NMDA receptor and potassium channel clusters. Kim et al. (1996)
suggested that these 2 proteins may interact at postsynaptic sites to
form a multimeric scaffold for the clustering of receptors, ion
channels, and associated signaling proteins.

In cultured cortical neurons, Sattler et al. (1999) suppressed
expression of the NMDA receptor scaffolding protein PSD95 and observed
selective attenuation of excitotoxicity triggered via NMDA receptors,
but not by other glutamate or calcium ion channels. NMDA receptor
function was unaffected because receptor expression, NMDA currents, and
calcium-45 loading were unchanged. Suppressing PSD95 blocked
calcium-activated nitric oxide production by NMDA receptors selectively
without affecting neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression or function.
Thus, PSD95 is required for efficient coupling of NMDAR activity to
nitric oxide toxicity and imparts specificity to excitotoxic calcium
signaling.

El-Husseini et al. (2000) found that overexpression of PSD95 in
hippocampal neurons could drive maturation of glutamatergic synapses.
PSD95 expression enhanced postsynaptic clustering and activity of
glutamate receptors. Postsynaptic expression of PSD95 also enhanced
maturation of the presynaptic terminal. These effects required synaptic
clustering of PSD95 but did not rely on its guanylate kinase domain.
PSD95 expression also increased the number and size of dendritic spines.
El-Husseini et al. (2000) concluded that PSD95 can orchestrate synaptic
development and suggested that PSD95 has a role in synapse stabilization
and plasticity.

Neuregulins and their receptors, the ERBB protein tyrosine kinases, are
essential for neuronal development, but their functions in the adult
central nervous system are unknown. Huang et al. (2000) reported that
ERBB4 (600543) is enriched in the postsynaptic density and associates
with PSD95. Heterologous expression of PSD95 enhanced NRG (142445)
activation of ERBB4 and MAP kinase (see 176948). Conversely, inhibiting
expression of PSD95 in neurons attenuated NRG-mediated activation of MAP
kinase. PSD95 formed a ternary complex with 2 molecules of ERBB4,
suggesting that PSD95 facilitates ERBB4 dimerization. Finally, NRG
suppressed induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1
region without affecting basal synaptic transmission. Thus, NRG
signaling may be synaptic and regulated by PSD95. Huang et al. (2000)
concluded that a role of NRG signaling in the adult central nervous
system may be modulation of synaptic plasticity.

El-Husseini et al. (2002) identified palmitate cycling on PSD95 at the
synapse and found that palmitate turnover on PSD95 is regulated by
glutamate receptor activity. Acutely blocking palmitoylation dispersed
synaptic clusters of PSD95 and caused a selective loss of synaptic AMPA
receptors (e.g., GRIA1; 138248). The authors also found that rapid
glutamate-mediated AMPA receptor internalization requires
depalmitoylation of PSD95. In a nonneuronal model system, clustering of
PSD95, stargazin (602911), and AMPA receptors was also regulated by
ongoing palmitoylation of PSD95 at the plasma membrane. El-Husseini et
al. (2002) concluded that palmitate cycling on PSD95 can regulate
synaptic strength and activity-dependent plasticity.

To treat stroke without blocking NMDA receptors, Aarts et al. (2002)
transduced neurons with peptides that disrupted the interaction of NMDA
receptors with the postsynaptic density protein PSD95. This procedure
dissociated NMDA receptors from downstream neurotoxic signaling without
blocking synaptic activity or calcium influx. The peptides, when applied
either before or 1 hour after an insult, protected cultured neurons from
excitotoxicity, reduced focal ischemic brain damage in rats, and
improved their neurologic function. Aarts et al. (2002) concluded that
their approach circumvents the negative consequences associated with
blocking NMDA receptors and may constitute a practical stroke therapy.

In cotransfection experiments, Tanemoto et al. (2002) showed that Kir5.1
(KCNJ16; 605722) assembled to form a functional homomeric potassium
channel by interacting with PSD95. The authors observed that Kir5.1
expressed alone was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm, but Kir5.1
coexpressed with PSD95 was located on the plasma membrane in a clustered
manner. Using GST pull-down studies, Tanemoto et al. (2002) identified
domains responsible for Kir5.1/PSD95 interaction. They reported that
protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Kir5.1 disrupted the
binding of Kir5.1 with PSD95. Tanemoto et al. (2002) hypothesized that
Kir5.1/PSD95 forms a functional brain potassium channel that may be a
physiologic target of PKA-mediated signaling. They concluded that PSD95
mediates formation of a functional potassium channel in the brain.

Conroy et al. (2003) showed that PDZ-containing proteins of the Psd95
family were required for maturation of functional nicotinic synapses in
embryonic chicken ciliary ganglia. These proteins also helped mediate
downstream activation of transcription factors.

Colledge et al. (2003) found that Psd95 interacted with and was
ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase Mdm2 (164785). In response to NMDA
receptor activation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, Psd95 was
ubiquitinated and rapidly removed from synaptic sites by
proteasome-dependent degradation. Mutations that blocked Psd95
ubiquitination prevented NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis.
Likewise, proteasome inhibitors prevented NMDA-induced AMPA receptor
internalization and synaptically induced long-term depression. Colledge
et al. (2003) concluded that ubiquitination of PSD95 through an
MDM2-mediated pathway regulates AMPA receptor surface expression during
synaptic plasticity.

Bao et al. (2004) found that sound-induced synaptic activity in the
mouse cochlea increased the level of nuclear neuregulin-1 intracellular
domain (Nrg-ICD) and upregulated PSD95 in postsynaptic spiral ganglion
neurons. Nrg-ICD enhanced the transcriptional activity of the PSD95
promoter by binding to Eos (606239), a zinc finger transcription factor.
The findings identified a molecular basis for activity-dependent
synaptic plasticity.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library, Li et al.
(2006) found that Gng13 (607298) interacted with Psd95. Mutation
analysis showed that the interaction involved the third PDZ domain of
Psd95 and the C-terminal CAAX motif of Gng13. Coexpression of Gng13 with
its G protein partner, Gnb1 (139380), did not interfere with the
interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction
between Psd95 and Gng13.

Aartsen et al. (2006) found that Mpp4 -/- mouse retinas showed
downregulation of Psd95 and mislocalization of both Psd95 and Veli3
(LIN7C; 612332) at the photoreceptor presynaptic membrane. They proposed
that MPP4 may function as a recruitment factor to organize signal
transducers at the photoreceptor synapse.

Kim et al. (2007) showed that phosphorylation of Psd95 in rat
hippocampal neurons enhanced Psd95 synaptic accumulation and the ability
of Psd95 to recruit surface AMPA receptors and potentiate excitatory
postsynaptic currents. They determined that the Rac1 (602048)-Jnk1
(MAPK8; 601158) signaling pathway mediated this phosphorylation.
Overexpression of a phosphomimicking mutant of Psd95 inhibited
NMDA-induced AMPA receptor internalization and blocked induction of
long-term depression.

Using PSD95 inhibitors, which uncouple postsynaptic density protein
PSD95 from neurotoxic signaling pathways, in gyrencephalic nonhuman
primates (cynomolgus macaques), Cook et al. (2012) showed that stroke
damage can be prevented when a PSD95 inhibitor is administered after
stroke onset in clinically relevant situations. The treatment reduced
infarct volumes as gauged by MRI and histology, preserved the capacity
of ischemic cells to maintain gene transcription in genomewide screens
of ischemic brain tissue, and significantly preserved neurologic
function in neurobehavioral assays. The degree of tissue neuroprotection
by MRI corresponded strongly to the preservation of neurologic function,
supporting the intuitive but unproven dictum that integrity of brain
tissue can reflect functional outcome. Cook et al. (2012) concluded that
their findings established that tissue neuroprotection and improved
functional outcome after stroke is unequivocally achievable in
gyrencephalic nonhuman primates treated with PSD95 inhibitors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stathakis et al. (1999) determined that the DLG4 gene contains 22 exons
and spans about 30 kb. All splice sites conform to the GT-AG rule,
except for the splice acceptor site of intron 5, which is TG instead of
AG. The promoter region contains no TATA or CAAT boxes, but has a large
GC-rich domain with characteristics of a CpG island.

Zhang et al. (2003) noted that the VLCAD (609575) and the DLG4 genes are
located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 17p. The transcribed
regions of the 2 genes overlap by about 220 bp. Using serial promoter
partial deletion constructs in a reporter gene assay, they found that
the essential promoter activity of DLG4 is carried within a region of
about 400 bp and covers the entire VLCAD minimal promoter, which spans
about 270 bp. The results from di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP)-treated HepG2 cells revealed that the minimal VLCAD promoter can
upregulate VLCAD expression in response to DEHP treatment. Site-directed
mutagenesis experiments showed that a mutated AP2 (107580)-binding site
markedly reduced the transcriptional activity of both the VLCAD and DLG4
promoters and abolished the minimal VLCAD promoter's response to DEHP
treatment.

Independently, Zhou and Blumberg (2003) determined that the VLCAD and
DLG4 genes overlap. The 2 genes share 245 nucleotides at their 5-prime
ends, and the transcription start site for DLG4 extends into the coding
region of VLCAD exon 1. The upstream regions of the VLCAD and DLG4
genes, including the overlapping region, contain 2 potential TATA-less
promoters with potential binding sites for several common transcription
factors. RT-PCR detected unique patterns of expression for VLCAD and
DLG4, indicating that, although they share common regulatory elements,
VLCAD and DLG4 also have distinct tissue-specific elements. The mouse
Dlg4 and Vlcad genes are oriented in a head-to-head manner, but they do
not overlap and are separated by almost 3.5 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Stathakis et al. (1997) localized the DLG4
gene to chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Specific patterns of neuronal firing induce changes in synaptic strength
that may contribute to learning and memory. If the postsynaptic NMDA
receptors are blocked, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission and the learning of spatial
information are prevented. The NMDA receptor can bind PSD95, which may
regulate the localization of and/or signaling by the receptor. Migaud et
al. (1998) found that in mutant mice lacking Psd95, the frequency
function of NMDA-dependent LTP and LTD was shifted to produce strikingly
enhanced LTP at different frequencies of synaptic stimulation. In
keeping with neural-network models that incorporate bidirectional
learning rules, this frequency shift was accompanied by severely
impaired spatial learning. Synaptic NMDA-receptor currents, subunit
expression, localization, and synaptic morphology were all unaffected in
the mutant mice. PSD95 thus appears to be important in coupling the NMDA
receptor to pathways that control bidirectional synaptic plasticity and
learning.

Using microarray analysis, Yao et al. (2004) identified Psd95 among a
small number of genes whose expression was downregulated in Dat (SLC6A3;
126455) -/- mice, Net (SLC6A2; 163970) -/- mice, and Vmat2 (SLC18A2;
193001) +/- mice, all of which are models of dopamine supersensitivity,
as well as in mice chronically treated with cocaine. In all 4 models,
Psd95 mRNA and protein levels were downregulated in nucleus accumbens
and caudate putamen. Psd95 protein was also decreased specifically in
striatum, but not in cortex and hippocampus, of cocaine-treated animals.
Enhanced long-term potentiation of frontocortico-accumbal glutamatergic
synapses correlated with reduced Psd95 levels in all 4 models. Yao et
al. (2004) also found that Psd95 -/- mice were supersensitive to cocaine
and lacked chronic cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity.

Beique et al. (2006) found that Psd95-null mice had decreased glutamate
AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission but NMDA receptors were not
affected. Although most of the affected synapses were located on
morphologically mature dendritic spines, a significant population of
synapses appeared unaffected by Psd95 depletion, suggesting that the
functional role of Psd95 displays synapse specificity.

;;MUNC13-1;;
KIAA1032
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the UNC13 family, such as UNC13A, are diacylglycerol and
phorbol ester receptors with ligand affinities similar to those of
protein kinase C (see PRKCA; 176960). Rodent Unc13a is a presynaptic
protein with an essential role in synaptic vesicle priming (Rossner et
al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned UNC13A, which they designated
KIAA1032. The 3-prime UTR of the UNC13A transcript contains several
repetitive elements. The deduced 986-amino acid protein shares 96% amino
acid identity with its rat homolog, Munc13-1. RT-PCR ELISA detected high
UNC13A expression in adult brain and in in several specific brain
regions. Expression was lower in fetal brain and lowest in adult spleen,
testis, pancreas, ovary, heart, and lung. No expression was detected in
adult liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney or in fetal liver.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the UNC13A
gene to chromosome 19.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rossner et al. (2004) examined amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760)
processing in mice deficient in Munc13-1 and in transgenic mice
overexpressing a mutant Munc13-1 unable to bind diacylglycerol or
phorbol esters. Since both mutant animals die within 5 hours of birth,
Rossner et al. (2004) analyzed brains of newborn mice and organotypic
brain slice cultures established from newborn mice. Both groups of
mutant mice had a specific impairment in the alpha-secretase (CTSB;
116810) pathway of App processing. Rossner et al. (2004) also found that
phorbol ester-stimulated App secretion was much less pronounced in brain
slices of mutant mice compared with those of wildtype mice.

PAH TRANSPORTER
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC22A6 is a member of a family of organic anion transporters. Within
renal proximal tubules, these transporters mediate the secretion of
endogenous and exogenous metabolites, including many clinically
important drugs.

CLONING

Using the sequence of the rat PAH transporter as query, Lu et al. (1999)
identified fetal brain ESTs for SLC22A6, which they designated PAHT.
They obtained the full-length clone by RT-PCR of adult kidney mRNA. The
deduced 550-amino acid protein contains 12 transmembrane spans, 4
protein kinase C (see 176960) phosphorylation sites, 4 protein kinase A
(see 176911) phosphorylation sites, and 5 putative N-glycosylation
sites. SLC22A6 shares 87% identity with rat Oat1, 85% identity with
mouse Oat1, and 32% and 29% identity with the cation transporters OCT1
(SLC22A1; 602607) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5; 603377), respectively. Northern
blot analysis of several tissues detected a 2.4-kb transcript only in
kidney.

Race et al. (1999) cloned SLC22A6, which they designated OAT1, from a
kidney cDNA library. The deduced protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 60.3 kD. SLC22A6 has 12 transmembrane-spanning domains that are
separated by 5 intracellular loops and 6 extracellular loops; the N and
C termini are intracellular. SLC22A6 also contains 3 motifs conserved in
the amphiphilic solute facilitator family of proteins. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript expressed strongly in kidney and
weakly in brain.

Bahn et al. (2000) identified a splice variant of OAT1 that has a 132-bp
in-frame deletion, resulting in the loss of transmembrane domain 11 and
half of transmembrane domain 12.

GENE FUNCTION

By analyzing PAHT transiently expressed in HeLa cells, Lu et al. (1999)
demonstrated time-dependent and saturable radiolabeled PAH uptake.
Preincubation with unlabeled alpha-ketoglutaric or with glutaric acid
stimulated PAH uptake, and preincubation with unlabeled PAH stimulated
uptake of radiolabeled alpha-ketoglutarate, consistent with
PAH/alpha-ketoglutarate exchange. Transport of radiolabeled PAH was
inhibited by furosemide, indomethacin, probenecid, and
alpha-ketoglutarate. It was not inhibited by prostaglandins or
methotrexate, indicating substrate specificity that is different than
that of rat Oat1. PAH uptake was also inhibited by phorbol esters in a
dose- and time-dependent fashion, indicating inhibition of transport by
phosphorylation through protein kinase C.

Race et al. (1999) demonstrated PAH uptake in Xenopus oocytes injected
with OAT1 mRNA. PAH uptake was dependent on chloride. Inhibitor studies
gave results similar to those reported by Lu et al. (1999).

GENE STRUCTURE

Bahn et al. (2000) determined that the SLC22A6 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 8.2 kb. The promoter region contains TATA and CCAAT boxes, a
thyroid hormone-binding site, and putative binding sites for nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), AP2 (107580), C/EBP-alpha (116897),
and SP1 (189906).

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis, Lu et al. (1999) mapped the SLC22A6
gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis, Race et al. (1999)
mapped the SLC22A6 gene to chromosome 11. Bahn et al. (2000) mapped the
SLC22A6 gene to chromosome 11q13.1-q13.2 using FISH.

;;MGA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Maltase-glucoamylase (MGA; EC 3.2.1.20) is a brush border membrane
enzyme that plays a role in the final steps of small intestinal
digestion of linear regions of starch to glucose. Brush border
sucrase-isomaltase (SI; 222900) serves a complementary function through
digestion of branched starch linkages. The complementary human enzyme
activities allow digestion of the starches of plant origin that make up
two-thirds of most diets. Naim et al. (1988) showed that
maltase-glucoamylase is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide
precursor, acquires N- and O-linked carbohydrates, and does not undergo
intracellular or extracellular proteolytic cleavage.

CLONING

Nichols et al. (1998) purified and partially sequenced the human
maltase-glucoamylase protein. By RT-PCR using degenerate
oligonucleotides based on the MGA protein sequence, they isolated human
small intestine MGA cDNAs. The deduced 1,857-amino acid MGA protein has
a putative type II membrane anchor, 2 WIDMNE catalytic sites, which are
characteristic of carbohydrate hydrolases such as SI, and 2 glycosyl
hydrolase family 31 signature 2 sequences. MGA also has 19 potential
N-glycosylation sites and 253 potential O-glycosylation sites. The MGA
protein shares 59% sequence identity with SI. RT-PCR detected MGA
expression in human small intestine, granulocyte, and kidney but not in
salivary gland or pancreas.

Nichols et al. (2003) cloned and sequenced the human MGAM gene and
demonstrated its close evolutionary relationship to SI. The 5-prime MGAM
gene product, when expressed as the N-terminal protein sequence,
hydrolyzes maltose and starch, but not sucrose, and is thus distinct
from SI. The catalytic residue was identified by mutation of an aspartic
acid known to be identical with that described for SI.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nichols et al. (2003) determined that the MGAM gene is approximately
82,000 bp long, with 48 identified exons. They stated that the exon
structures of MGAM and SI are identical.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MGAM
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP SHGC-32830).

From comparisons of the sequence of the MGAM gene with those of various
BAC clones that had been mapped, Nichols et al. (2003) concluded that
MGAM is located on chromosome 7q34, 3-prime of MDL1 (604987) at 7q33 and
5-prime of TCRB (see 186930) at 7q35.

EVOLUTION

Based on shared exon structures and peptide domains, including proton
donors of MGAM and SI, Nichols et al. (2003) suggested that the genes
evolved by duplication of an ancestral gene, which itself had already
undergone tandem gene duplication.

609507	TITLE *609507 TOPOISOMERASE I-BINDING ARGININE/SERINE-RICH PROTEIN; TOPORS
;;p53-BINDING PROTEIN 3; P53BP3;;
LUN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using murine p53 (191170) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa
cell cDNA library, Zhou et al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
TOPORS, which they called P53BP3. TOPORS is rich in serine and arginine
and contains a leucine zipper domain, 2 PEST sequences, a central basic
domain containing 2 potential bipartite nuclear localization signals,
and 2 C-terminal PEST sequences. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous but variable expression of a 5.0-kb transcript. Highest
expression was in testis, and lowest expression was in lung.
Fluorescence-labeled TOPORS localized to nuclear star-like clusters in
transfected HeLa cells.

Using the N-terminal 250 amino acids of topoisomerase I (TOP1; 126420)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed
by 5-prime RACE of leukemia cell mRNA, Haluska et al. (1999) cloned
TOPORS. They extended the 5-prime coding region reported by Zhou et al.
(1999) and determined that the full-length protein contains 1,045 amino
acids.

Using degenerate primers to amplify cDNAs encoding RING finger proteins
from human lung cDNA, followed by screening a lung cDNA library, Chu et
al. (2001) cloned TOPORS, which they designated LUN. The deduced
1,045-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 119 kD.
TOPORS contains an N-terminal PEST sequence, followed by a C3H4-type
RING finger domain, a leucine zipper coiled-coil region, 2 PEST
sequences, a nuclear localization signal, and 2 C-terminal PEST
sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb transcript in brain,
kidney, liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, and skeletal muscle, and a 3.6-kb
transcript in heart and lung. Highest expression of TOPORS was in lung.
In situ hybridization of adult lung sections detected TOPORS in alveolar
epithelium and in some squamous and cuboidal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhou et al. (1999) determined that a central
region of TOPORS containing the putative nuclear localization signal and
2 PEST sequences was required for interaction with p53. The leucine
zipper of TOPORS was dispensable for interaction with p53.

By coimmunoprecipitation assays of transfected HeLa cells, Haluska et
al. (1999) confirmed that TOPORS interacts with TOP1.

Chu et al. (2001) found that TOPORS had zinc-dependent DNA binding
activity. The region from amino acids 51 to 374 was responsible for DNA
binding. Chu et al. (2001) identified a palindromic DNA sequence that
bound TOPORS in the upstream regulatory region of the E-cadherin gene
(CDH1; 192090) and in 2 intervening regions of the talin gene (TLN1;
186745).

Rajendra et al. (2004) found that TOPORS functioned in vitro as an E3
ubiquitin ligase with the E2 enzymes UBCH5A (UBE2D1; 602961), UBCH5C
(UBE2D3; 602963), and UBCH6 (UBE2E1; 602916), but not with other E2
enzymes examined. A conserved tryptophan within the RING domain of
TOPORS was required for ubiquitination activity. In vitro and cellular
studies implicated p53 as a ubiquitination substrate for TOPORS. Similar
to MDM2 (164785), overexpression of TOPORS resulted in a
proteasome-dependent decrease in p53 protein expression in a human
osteosarcoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TOPORS gene contains 3 exons and spans 13 kb (Haluska et al., 1999).

MAPPING

By FISH, Zhou et al. (1999) mapped the TOPORS gene to chromosome
12p12.1-p11.2. However, Chu et al. (2001) mapped the TOPORS gene by FISH
to chromosomes 9p21, a localization confirmed by the International
Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium (TMAP RH98974).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chakarova et al. (2007) used a positional cloning approach to sequence
genes in the critical region on 9p21.1 linked to a form of autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa with a distinct phenotype (RP31; 609923).
They identified a heterozygous 1-bp insertion in exon 3 of the TOPORS
gene in a Canadian family (609507.0001). In a small German family, a
2-bp deletion in exon 3 was associated with the characteristic phenotype
(609507.0002). Chakarova et al. (2007) commented that the ubiquitous
nature of TOPORS expression and a lack of mutant protein in patients was
highly suggestive of haploinsufficiency, rather than a dominant-negative
effect, as the molecular mechanism of the disease and made the clinical
phenotype amenable to rescue by somatic gene therapy.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 31
TOPORS, 1-BP INS, 2474A

In a French Canadian family with early-onset autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa and perivascular retinal pigment epithelium atrophy
(RP31; 609923), Chakarova et al. (2007) identified a 1-bp insertion,
2474_2475insA, in exon 3 of the TOPORS gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in premature termination of the protein (tyr825fs).

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 31
TOPORS, 2-BP DEL, 2552GA

In a small German family, Chakarova et al. (2007) found that autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa with perivascular retinal pigment
epithelium atrophy (RP31; 609923) was associated with a 2-bp deletion,
2552_2553delGA, in exon 3 of the TOPORS gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in premature termination of the protein (arg851fs).

612700	TITLE *612700 RIMS-BINDING PROTEIN 3B; RIMBP3B
;;RIMBP3.2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) cloned mouse Rimbp3, and by database
analysis, they identified 3 human RIMBP3 genes, RIMBP3 (612699),
RIMBP3B, and RIMBP3C (612701), which share 99% nucleotide identity. Each
of the deduced human RIMBP3 proteins contains 1,639 amino acids and has
a calculated molecular mass of 180 kD. The protein has a central SRC
(190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain, followed by 2 tandem fibronectin
(135600)-like 3 (FN3) domains, and 2 C-terminal SH3 domains.
Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) noted that all other members of the RIMBP
family have 3 tandem FN3 domains. The N-terminal region is rich in
arginine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, and proline.
Quantitative real-time PCR of mouse tissues detected ubiquitous Rimbp3
expression, with the highest level in testis. Rimbp3 showed low uniform
expression in all mouse brain regions examined and in embryonic mouse
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) found that each of the 3 RIMBP3 genes
contains a single exon. RIMBP3B spans about 5.5 kb.

MAPPING

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) mapped the 3 RIMBP3 genes to a 1.4-Mb
region of chromosome 22q11.21. They mapped the single mouse Rimbp3 gene
to chromosome 16A3.

612034	TITLE *612034 APC2 GENE; APC2
;;APC-LIKE; APCL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to APC (611731),
followed by screening a brain cDNA library, Nakagawa et al. (1998)
cloned APC2, which they called APCL. The deduced 2,303-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, followed by an
armadillo domain and five 20-amino acid repeats. APC and APC2 are highly
similar in their N-terminal halves, but share no similarity in their
C-terminal halves. Northern blot analysis detected an APC2 transcript of
more than 10 kb expressed specifically and abundantly in brain.

Van Es et al. (1999) cloned mouse and human APC2. The mouse protein
contains 2,274 amino acids. RNA dot blot analysis of human tissues
showed APC2 expression throughout the central nervous system.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakagawa et al. (1998) found that the 20-amino acid repeat domain of
APCL could bind beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) and deplete the
intracellular beta-catenin pool. A reporter gene assay revealed that
APCL could regulate interaction of beta-catenin with T cell-specific
transcription factors (see TCF7; 189908), although less efficiently than
APC.

Using mutation analysis, van Es et al. (1999) showed that the 2 SAMP
domains of mouse Apc2 were required to bind conductin (AXIN2; 604025).

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakagawa et al. (1998) determined that the APC2 gene contains 14 exons
and spans 40 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakagawa et al. (1998) and van Es et al. (1999) mapped the APC2
gene to chromosome 19p13.3. Van Es et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Apc2
gene to a region of chromosome 10 that shares homology of synteny with
human chromosome 19p13.3.

;;ACETYLSEROTONIN METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE, X-LINKED; ASMTLX
DESCRIPTION The human Y chromosome is an extreme case with respect to recombination
frequencies. Over most of its entire length, the Y chromosome is
virtually a nonrecombining chromosome. At its distal ends, however,
within the 2 X-Y homologous pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2),
recombination frequencies are extremely high. Indeed, PAR1 on Xp/Yp
exhibits one of the highest recombination rates in male meiosis in the
human genome. This is due to the fact that males have an obligatory
crossover within the 2.6-Mb region of PAR1 (Rappold, 1993). The
preponderance of gene families expressed specifically in the testes has
been described on the nonrecombining portion of the human Y chromosome
(Lahn and Page, 1997). This has raised questions about the evolutionary
forces that led to their creation as well as to the molecular mechanisms
involved. In contrast, the evolution of genes and gene families in the
recombining portion of Y is likely to follow very different principles.
For example, the high frequency of recombination may have rendered this
region more prone to unequal crossing over, leading to gene duplications
in the ancestral PAR1 region. Ried et al. (1998) stated that to that
time 9 genes and 1 pseudogene had been characterized within PAR1. Only 2
of them, ASMT (300015) and XE7 (312095), had been characterized as
'single' genes, whereas all the others had close relatives in the genome
or were duplicated within PAR1. In this connection, Ried et al. (1998)
isolated a novel pseudoautosomal gene, ASMTL (N-acetylserotonin
O-methyltransferase-like), showing significant homology to the ASMT
gene. ASMT is an enzyme catalyzing the last step in the synthesis of
melatonin, a hormone that depresses body temperature and facilitates
sleep onset by inducing the circadian rhythm. It is exclusively
expressed in brain, retina, and pineal gland. Besides the homology of
ASMTL to ASMT in its 3-prime part, the N-terminal part of ASMTL is
similar to the entire length of the multicopy associated filamentation
(maf) protein of Bacillus subtilis and to orfE of Escherichia coli, gene
products involved in the regulation of cell division and growth. The
bipartite structure suggested that ASMTL is the product of a gene fusion
event, during which 2 different full-length genes are joined to form a
single gene. Ried et al. (1998) also detected the identity of 1 exon
(1A) of ASMT to exon 3 in yet another pseudoautosomal gene, XE7. The
data suggested that exon duplication and exon shuffling as well gene
fusion may represent common characteristics of the evolution of the
pseudoautosomal region.

Ried et al. (1998) found that ASMTL resides proximal to and in the close
vicinity of ANT3 (300151). The cosmid used in the initial cDNA selection
approach contained not only the 3-prime end of ASMTL but also the entire
ANT3 gene. ANT3 had previously been shown to be associated with a CpG
island located approximately 1,300 kb from the telomere. Sequencing
indicated that the 5-prime end of ASMTL is located approximately 1,350
kb from Xptel. Thus, the homologous genes ASMTL and ASMT (previously
mapped 1,700-1,800 kb from Xptel) reside within 500 kb in the middle
portion of PAR1.
