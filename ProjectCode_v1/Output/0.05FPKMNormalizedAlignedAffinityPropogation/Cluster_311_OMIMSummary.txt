;;C1q-RELATED FACTOR; CRF;;
C1QRF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Berube et al. (1999) isolated mouse and human C1QL1 cDNA, which they
called CRF. The deduced 258-amino acid human protein has a predicted
molecular mass of 28.4 kD and shares 97% homology with the mouse
protein. C1QL1 has a C-terminal globular domain that shares homology
with the C1q signature domain of C1q subunits (see C1QA; 120550) and an
N-terminal collagenous domain and a hydrophobic sequence. Dot blot
analysis of human tissues detected C1QL1 in all specific brain regions
examined as well as in adult kidney, lung, small intestine, appendix,
heart, colon, bladder, uterus, prostate, stomach, and fetal brain,
heart, and kidney. Immunofluorescence localized C1QL1 exclusively to
clusters in the cytoplasm, likely to Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum. In
situ hybridization of mouse brain detected highest expression in
cerebellar Purkinje cells, the accessory and inferior olivary nucleus,
the red nucleus, and the cortex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Berube et al. (1999) determined that the C1QL1 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Berube et al. (1999) mapped the C1QL1 gene to
chromosome 17q21.

604447	TITLE *604447 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, BETA-5; GNB5
;;GB5
DESCRIPTION The beta subunits of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G
proteins) are important regulators of G protein alpha subunits as well
as of certain signal transduction receptors and effectors. For
structural information about these proteins, see 600874.

CLONING

Using a degenerate PCR approach to screen a human brain cDNA library,
Jones et al. (1998) cloned the beta-5 subunit, symbolized GNB5, of G
protein. In contrast to beta subunits 1 through 4, which are at least
83% homologous, GNB5 is only 50% homologous to the other beta subunits.
On the other hand, the predicted 353-amino acid protein sequence is
99.4% homologous to the mouse beta-5 protein, with only 2 conservative
amino acid differences. Northern blot analysis revealed that mouse Gnb5
is expressed predominantly in brain (Watson et al., 1994), whereas human
GNB5 is expressed at high levels not only in brain but also in pancreas,
kidney, and heart (Jones et al., 1998), as a major 3.0- and minor 2.0-
and 9.0-kb transcripts. Within the brain, (Jones et al., 1998) detected
highest expression in cerebellum, cerebral cortex, occipital pole,
frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and caudate putamen, and lowest expression
in corpus callosum and spinal cord.

Watson et al. (1996) reported the cloning of a retina-specific cDNA,
termed G-beta-5L, in the mouse, which is identical to GNB5 except for an
additional 126-bp 5-prime exon.

GENE FUNCTION

GNB5 interacts with regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins
containing the G protein gamma-like (GGL) domain: RGS6 (603894), RGS7
(602517), RGS9 (604067), and RGS11 (603895). Chen et al. (2003)
presented data indicating that GNB5 and GGL domain-containing RGS
proteins are obligate partners and supporting the notion that GNB5
functions as a component of the GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP)
complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rosskopf et al. (2003) determined that the GNB5 gene contains 12 exons.
The first exon is noncoding and exons 2 and 3 contain alternate ATG
translational start codons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GNB5
gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP sts-AA017518).

ANIMAL MODEL

The 'flailer' (flr) mouse exhibits a phenotype consisting of frequent
falling, convulsive limb movements (leg flailing), and ataxia persistent
into adulthood. Jones et al. (2000) determined that the flailer mouse
expresses a novel gene combining the promoter and first 2 exons of Gnb5
with the C-terminal exons of the closely linked myosin-5A (MyoVA) gene
(Myo5a; 160777). Biochemical and genetic studies indicated that the
flailer protein, which is expressed predominantly in brain, competes
with wildtype MyoVA in vivo, preventing the localization of smooth
endoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the dendritic spines of cerebellar
Purkinje cells. The flailer protein thus has a dominant-negative
mechanism of action with a recessive mode of inheritance due to the
dependence of competitive binding on the ratio between mutant and
wildtype proteins. The chromosomal arrangement of Myo5a upstream of Gnb5
is consistent with nonhomologous recombination as the mutational
mechanism.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Halford et al. (1995) cloned ZNF160 from a human fetal brain cDNA
library. Sequence analysis showed that it contained 9 finger motifs of
the C2H2 type. Northern blot analysis of human fetal tissues showed 2
main transcripts of 3.2 and 5.1 kb in heart, brain, lung, liver, and
kidney. Various larger transcripts (7-8.5 kb) were detected at lower
levels.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Halford et al. (1995) mapped the
ZNF160 gene to chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4.

610130	TITLE *610130 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 26 (SULFATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 1; SLC26A1
;;SULFATE ANION TRANSPORTER 1; SAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC26A1 belongs to a family of transporters that mediate electroneutral
exchange of Cl- for HCO3- across the plasma membrane (Lohi et al.,
2000).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human kidney mRNA using primers derived from the mouse
Slc26a1 cDNA, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Regeer et al. (2003)
cloned SLC26A1. They also identified a SLC26A1 variant lacking exon 2 in
the 5-prime UTR. The deduced 701-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 75 kD. It has 12 putative transmembrane domains
and intracellular N and C termini. SLC26A1 contains a sulfate
transporter signature, a phosphopantetheine attachment site, a STAS
domain, a sulfate transporter family sequence, 2 putative extracellular
N-glycosylation sites, and multiple putative intracellular
phosphorylation sites. PCR analysis showed highest expression in kidney
and liver, with lower expression in brain, colon, thymus, spleen, small
intestine, leukocytes, pancreas, testis, and prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Regeer et al. (2003) found that Xenopus oocytes injected with SLC26A1
cRNA showed 40-fold induction of sulfate uptake, 5-fold induction of
chloride uptake, and 6-fold induction of oxalate uptake compared with
water-injected controls. Formate was not a transport substrate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Regeer et al. (2003) determined that the SLC26A1 gene spans 5.8 kb and
contains 4 exons, with translation initiation beginning in exon 3. The
5-prime flanking region is 60% GC rich, lacks canonical TATA and CAAT
boxes, and has a large number of potential cis-acting elements
recognized by transcription factors. Regeer et al. (2003) identified a
minimal promoter containing an AP1 (165160) site that was essential for
transcription.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Lohi et al. (2000) mapped the SLC26A1 gene
to chromosome 4p16.3.

608144	TITLE *608144 SAM POINTED DOMAIN-CONTAINING ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; SPDEF
;;PROSTATE EPITHELIUM-SPECIFIC ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; PDEF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PDEF is an ETS transcription factor expressed in prostate epithelial
cells. It acts as an androgen-independent transactivator of PSA (176820)
expression.

CLONING

Oettgen et al. (2000) identified PDEF within an EST from a subtracted
prostate benign hyperplasia cDNA library, and they obtained the
full-length clone by RACE of an adult prostate cDNA library. The deduced
335-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 37.5 kD. PDEF
contains 2 putative PEST sequences, one near the N terminus and the
other at the center of the protein, a central pointed domain, which is
characteristic of some ETS family members and weakly homologous to the
SAM protein-protein interaction domain of polycomb proteins and Eph
receptors, and an ETS DNA-binding domain. It also has several potential
phosphorylation sites, including 8 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK; see 602898) phosphorylation sites, 5 of which are clustered at
the N terminus. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb transcript
expressed almost exclusively in prostate gland. Low levels of PDEF were
detected in ovary, mammary gland, and salivary gland. RT-PCR of several
cell lines detected expression only in a prostate epithelial cancer cell
line. In situ hybridization on frozen sections of prostate showed
diffuse strong expression restricted to luminal epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Oettgen et al. (2000) determined that PDEF bound with high affinity to
DNA containing sequences found in 2 of the 11 putative ETS-binding sites
in the PSA promoter/enhancer region. PDEF is a unique ETS family member
in that it showed highest affinity for GGAT rather than GGAA in the core
of the binding site. Using a promoter-reporter construct cotransfected
with PDEF into simian kidney cells, Oettgen et al. (2000) determined
that PDEF is an androgen-independent transcriptional activator of the
PSA promoter.

Park et al. (2007) showed that Spdef was expressed in a subset of
epithelial cells in tracheal glands and in the conducting airways of
fetal and adult mouse lung. Spdef directly interacted with Ttf1 (TITF1;
600635) and influenced expression of a number of genes in epithelial
cells and conducting airways. Il13 (147683)- and Stat6
(601512)-dependent induction of Spdef was observed in association with
goblet cell hyperplasia. Expression of Spdef in nonciliated airway
epithelial cells (Clara cells) caused goblet cell hyperplasia,
demonstrating its role in the regulation of airway epithelial
differentiation.

613226	TITLE *613226 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 296; ZNF296
;;ZFP296;;
ZNF342
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Znf296,
followed by PCR of testis cDNA, Dear (2000) cloned human ZNF296. The
deduced 347-amino acid human protein shares 67.3% homology with the
333-amino acid mouse protein. Both contain 6 C2H2-type zinc finger
motifs, 6 putative phosphorylation sites, and 7 N-myristoylation sites.
RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues detected highest Znf296 expression in
testis and embryonic stem cells. Znf296 was also expressed in bone
marrow. In situ hybridization of mouse testis of various developmental
stages revealed Znf296 expression in condensing spermatids of adult
mouse testis only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dear (2000) determined that the ZNF296 gene contains 2 coding exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Dear (2000) mapped the ZNF296 gene to
chromosome 19. They mapped the mouse Znf296 gene to a region of proximal
chromosome 7 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 19.

By sequence analysis, Poland et al. (2009) mapped the ZNF296 gene to
chromosome 19q13.32.

CYTOGENETICS

Poland et al. (2009) reported a 10-year-old boy with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML; 601626) subtype M1 and an acquired translocation,
t(17;19)(q22;q13.32). The translocation breakpoint on chromosome 17 was
in the promoter/enhancer region of the MPO gene (606989), and the
breakpoint on chromosome 19 was within the promoter region of the ZNF296
gene, which Poland et al. (2009) called ZNF342. The translocation
resulted in a derivative chromosome 17 containing the promoter/enhancer
region of the MPO gene fused to the promoter and coding region of the
ZNF296 gene, resulting in 90-fold upregulation of ZNF296 expression in
the patient's leukemia cells.

602552	TITLE *602552 NUCLEOPORIN, 88-KD; NUP88
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By coprecipitation with CAN (114350), Fornerod et al. (1997) identified
a novel nuclear pore complex (NPC) component that they called NUP88.
Fornerod et al. (1997) derived cDNAs encoding NUP88 from the dBEST
database and from screening a human placental cDNA library. By combining
sequence information from these sources, they constructed 2 overlapping
cDNA contigs that diverged at their 3-prime ends. The cDNAs, measuring
2,359 and 3,489 bp, were colinear until nucleotide 2323, in the 3-prime
untranslated region. Northern blot analysis showed a major transcript of
approximately 2.5 kb expressed in every tissue studied, but particularly
prominent in testis, and a minor transcript of approximately 3.5 kb,
which was most abundant in brain. Fornerod et al. (1997) found that the
NUP88 cDNA predicted a protein of 741 amino acids with a molecular mass
of 85 kD. The protein migrated at 88 kD and was therefore named NUP88 to
distinguish it from NUP85. Fornerod et al. (1997) stated that the
C-terminal region of NUP88 has sequences predicted to form a
coiled-coil, an interaction domain often found in NPC proteins.
Depletion of CAN from the NPC results in concomitant loss of NUP88,
indicating that localization of NUP88 to the NPC is dependent on CAN
binding (Fornerod et al., 1997).

MAPPING

The NUP88 gene maps to human chromosome 17p13 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (Fornerod et al., 1997).

602142	TITLE *602142 PHOSPHOLIPASE C, DELTA-1; PLCD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) acts as a signal
transducer that generates 2 second messengers, diacylglycerol and
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, by hydrolyzing inositol phospholipids. PLC
comprises a diverse family of enzymes that differ in structure and
tissue distribution (Berridge, 1993).

CLONING

By screening a human aortic smooth muscle cDNA library with a probe
derived from a rat C6 glioma cell PLC-delta-1 cDNA, Cheng et al. (1995)
cloned a PLCD1 cDNA. The deduced 756-amino acid protein shares 95%
sequence homology with the rat protein. It contains a pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain and the conserved X and Y domains of PLC proteins.
It is distinguished from PLC-gamma (see 172420) by lack of the SH2 and
SH3 domains that are essential for activation of PLC-gamma by tyrosine
protein kinases, and from PLC-beta (see 600810) by lack of the
C-terminal region of PLC-beta that is responsible for binding and
activation by G proteins. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a 3.8-kb transcript, with highest expression in lung,
heart, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and kidney. An additional 7.5-kb
transcript was detected in skeletal muscle.

Kiuru et al. (2011) performed immunohistochemical analysis of human
fetal nail sections and detected prominent localization of PLCD1 in the
nail matrix and nail bed. In addition, real-time quantitative PCR
analysis demonstrated expression of PLCD1 mRNA in human skin and hair
follicles.

MAPPING

Lyu et al. (1996) mapped the PLCD1 gene to chromosome 3 by means of a
human/rodent somatic cell panel.

In the course of a large-scale sequencing analysis of genomic DNA in the
vicinity of a homozygous deletion on chromosome 3p found in a lung
cancer cell line, Ishikawa et al. (1997) found that the PLCD1 was
located just distal to the region removed by the deletion. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they localized the PLCD1 gene to
3p22-p21.3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ishikawa et al. (1997) determined that the PLCD1 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 22 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

When human PLCD1 was expressed in E. coli, the recombinant enzyme
displayed high phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolyzing
activity in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner (Cheng et al., 1995).

Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, Hu et al. (2009) found that expression of
PLCD1 was silenced or reduced in a significant number of gastric cancer
cell lines compared with normal gastric tissues. Methylation-specific
PCR showed that silenced or reduced PLCD1 expression was associated with
methylation of the PLCD1 CpG island. In 98 primary gastric cancers,
PLCD1 methylation significantly correlated with high-stage tumors.
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed reduced PLCD1 protein levels in
primary gastric carcinomas compared with normal gastric mucosa.
Transfection of PLCD1 into gastric tumor cell lines had no effect on
cell proliferation or cell cycle arrest, but it suppressed colony
formation and cell migration and reduced cytoskeletal changes associated
with cell migration. Expression of PLCD1 also reduced the metastatic
potential of a gastric cancer cell line following injection into nude
mice. Hu et al. (2009) concluded that PLCD1 functions as a tumor
suppressor involved in gastric cancers.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shimohama et al. (1998) examined the entire sequences corresponding to
protein-coding exons 2-15 of the hamster PLC-delta-1 gene in genomic DNA
derived from the leukocytes of 13 unrelated patients with early-onset
sporadic Alzheimer disease (104300). In 1 of these patients whose
clinical features and course did not differ from those of the other 12
cases, they found a change of codon CGC (arg) to CAC (his), located in
the pleckstrin homology domain of the PLCD1 gene. They stated that this
was the first mutation found in the human PLC genes. Site-directed
mutagenesis of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST/PLCD1) fusion protein
changing arg105 to his resulted in a 4-fold decrease in the affinity of
specific binding and a reduction in hydrolyzing activity to about 40% of
that of the wildtype enzyme. This remarkable loss of function could be
interpreted in terms of a conformational change in the pleckstrin
homology domain. Shimohama et al. (1998) found that the arg105-to-his
mutation was present in heterozygous state in the patient with AD. The
mutation was not found in DNA extracted from leukocytes of 23 unrelated
patients with familial AD, 23 unrelated patients with early-onset
sporadic AD, 46 unrelated patients with late-onset sporadic AD, and 456
nondemented control subjects. Thus the change did not appear to be a
common polymorphism. However, determination of the possible pathologic
role required transgenic studies of the mutant gene to determine the
role of the enzyme and the mutation and a search for other mutations in
the pleckstrin homology domain of PLC genes in human subjects with
genetic disorders. They pointed out that mutations in the pleckstrin
homology domain of the BTK gene (300300) occur in patients with Bruton
agammaglobulinemia (300755).

- Nonsyndromic Congenital Nail Disorder 3

In 4 Pakistani families with leukonychia totalis, also referred to as
nonsyndromic congenital nail disorder-3 (NDNC3; 151600), mapping to
chromosome 3p22-p21.3, 2 of which demonstrated autosomal recessive
inheritance and 2 of which were consistent with autosomal dominant
inheritance, Kiuru et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity or heterozygosity for nonsense, splice site, and missense
mutations in the PLCD1 gene (602142.0001-602142.0004). Kiuru et al.
(2011) noted that the phenomenon of recessive and dominant mutations in
the same gene resulting in a similar phenotype is very rare.

homozygosity for a 1309C-T transition in the PLCD1 gene, resulting in an
arg437-to-ter (R437X) substitution. The mutation was not found in 130

11 and exon 12 (1792-10delTGTAGTGGCC) in the PLCD1 gene, predicted to
result in a premature termination codon due to a frameshift or

194628	TITLE *194628 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 121; ZNF121
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chen et al. (1993) screened a human brain cDNA library with an
oligonucleotide complementary to the conserved 'linker' sequence between
adjacent zinc fingers. The insert of 1 positive clone of 1,226
nucleotides contained a novel open reading frame, designated ZNF121,
with 9 zinc finger motifs; in addition, 10 repeats of the
pentanucleotide sequence (ATTTT) were found 223 nucleotides after a stop
codon and were followed by an Alu repeat. The pentanucleotide repeat was
polymorphic in the CEPH families, with 7 alleles ranging in size from
147 to 197 nucleotides.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (1993) mapped the ZNF121 gene to chromosome 19 by analysis
of somatic cell hybrid panels. The polymorphic locus was designated
D19S204. Using the polymorphism, Chen et al. (1993) showed that it was
strongly linked to markers on 19p in an area in which other zinc finger
sequences and multiple cosmid clones containing zinc fingers had
previously been localized.

609172	TITLE *609172 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 16A; PPP1R16A
;;MYOSIN PHOSPHATASE TARGET SUBUNIT 3; MYPT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see 176875)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse adipocyte cell line cDNA
library, Skinner and Saltiel (2001) cloned mouse Ppp1r16a, which they
called Mypt3. The deduced 524-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 57.5 kD. Mypt3 contains a PP1-binding site, followed
by 5 ankyrin (see 612641) repeats, a putative Walker A ATP/GTP-binding
site, 2 SH3-binding sites, and a C-terminal CAAX box farnesylation
motif. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 3.2 kb in
mouse heart, brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and testis. Mypt3 was
weakly expressed in kidney, but absent from spleen. A transcript of
about 2.8 kb was detected in mouse preadipocyte fibroblasts and
differentiated adipocytes, with slight upregulation during
differentiation. Western blot analysis detected Mypt3 protein expressed
in the same mouse tissues and cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Skinner and Saltiel (2001) showed that recombinant mouse Mypt3 was
prenylated by purified recombinant farnesyltransferase (see 134635) in
vitro. Endogenous PP1 from mouse fibroblast cell line lysates
specifically interacted with Mypt3. Recombinant Mypt3 inhibited purified
PP1 activity toward phosphorylase a, myosin light chain, and myosin
substrates in vitro.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of rat testis proteins, Ruan et al.(2011)
found that p12 (OAZ3; 605138) interacted with Mypt3. Immunohistochemical
analysis showed that expression of p12 and Mypt3 overlapped in sperm
tail. Cotransfection experiments revealed that binding to p12 resulted
in accumulation of Mypt3 in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution away
from the membrane. Mutation of ankyrin domain-2 of Mypt3 abrogated the
interaction of Mypt3 with p12. Mypt3 also interacted with sperm tail
PP1-gamma-2 (see PPP1CC; 176914), which reduced stress fiber formation
when expressed alone in transfected mouse fibroblasts. Ruan et al.(2011)
found that Mypt3 elevated stress fiber formation by inhibiting
PP1-gamma-2, and that p12 disrupted Mypt3-PP1-gamma-2 complexes and
counteracted the inhibitory effect of Mypt3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Skinner and Saltiel (2001) determined that the coding region of the
mouse Ppp1r16a gene contains 10 exons and spans about 3.7 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
PPP1R16A gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP SGC33369).

By radiation hybrid analysis, Skinner and Saltiel (2001) mapped the
mouse Ppp1r16a gene to a region of chromosome 15 that shows homology of
synteny to human chromosomes 8 and 22.

607443	TITLE *607443 EPIDIDYMAL SPERM BINDING PROTEIN 1; ELSPBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Saalmann et al. (2001) cloned Elspbp1 from canine epididymis by
differential display, and used this sequence to clone human ELSPBP1 from
an epididymal cDNA library. The deduced 233-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal signal peptide characteristic of a secretory protein, and
4 tandem fibronectin type II (FN2) repeats. RT-PCR of epididymal cDNA
suggested the presence of splice variants containing fewer FN2 modules.
Human and canine proteins share nearly 80% identity. Northern blot
analyses of both human and canine tissues revealed high levels of a
1.1-kb ELSPBP1 transcript only in epididymis, and not in other tissues
investigated, including human testis, seminal vesicles, and prostate.
Northern blot analysis of dissected human epididymis indicated
expression in all regions, with highest expression in the corpus. In
situ localization of Elspbp1 in canine epididymis indicated high
expression along the basal surface of the duct epithelium, with
strongest labeling of the distal caput and corpus epididymis. Western
blot analysis revealed a protein of 30 to 35 kD in human epididymal
fluid and in membrane protein preparations of ejaculated sperm.

602001	TITLE *602001 NEUROPEPTIDE Y RECEPTOR Y5; NPY5R
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gerald et al. (1996) cloned a novel Y-type receptor that they termed Y5
from rat hypothalamus and reported that it encodes a 456-amino acid
protein with less than 35% overall identity to known Y-type receptors.
They identified a human Y5 homolog in the GenBank database having 87%
overall identity with rat Y5.

Hu et al. (1996) cloned the rat and human Y5 receptors from a rat
hypothalamus cDNA library and a human genomic library, respectively.
Both genes encode 445-amino acid polypeptides with 7 putative
transmembrane domains. The rat and human Y5 protein sequences share 88%
identity and show 30 to 33% identity to other NPY receptor subtypes.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene is expressed as a 2.6-kb
mRNA in the brain but in no other tissues tested. Hu et al. (1996) also
isolated another rat cDNA containing a 123-amino acid insertion near the
5-prime end, which may represent an alternatively spliced form of the
gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Hu et al. (1996) examined the pharmacologic profile of the Y5 receptor
and found that it was unique from that of other NPY receptors and
correlated well with peptides known to elicit feeding. By in situ
hybridization, Gerald et al. (1996) localized rat brain Y5 expression to
the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the lateral hypothalamus, and
other locations consistent with a role in the control of feeding
behavior.

MAPPING

Gerald et al. (1996) suggested the possibility that Y1 (162641) and Y5
could map, in opposite orientation, to the same locus on human
chromosome 4q. Hu et al. (1996) noted that the human Y5 receptor
sequence is nearly identical to, but in the opposite orientation from,
that of the human Y1 receptor sequence, overlapping the Y1 exon 1C
promoter, exon 1C, and a portion of the associated intronic sequences.
Herzog et al. (1997) pointed out that this finding confirms
colocalization of the 2 genes at chromosome 4q31-q32, the known location
of the NPYR1 gene. This unusual arrangement suggested to Herzog et al.
(1997) that the 2 genes arose by a gene duplication event and that the 2
genes may be coordinately expressed.

Lutz et al. (1997) confirmed the assignment of NPY5R to chromosome 4 by
Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids. They mapped the Npy5r
gene to mouse chromosome 8.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ishihara et al. (2006) found that chronic administration of a Y5R
antagonist selectively suppressed body weight gain and improved
hyperinsulinemia in mice with diet-induced obesity. The antagonist did
not affect the body weight of lean mice fed a regular diet or that of
genetically obese leptin receptor (LEPR; 601007)-deficient mice or rats.
Ishihara et al. (2006) concluded that Y5R is involved in regulation and
development of diet-induced obesity.

607583	TITLE *607583 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 11G; PEX11G
;;PEX11-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis and EST database searching using PEX11B
(603867) as query, Li et al. (2002) identified PEX11G and obtained the
full-length human and mouse cDNAs. Both human and mouse PEX11G contain
241 amino acids. Phylogenic analysis determined that PEX11G represents a
subfamily of PEX11 proteins distinct from the branch that includes
PEX11A (603866) and PEX11B. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected tissue-specific expression, with high levels in liver and much
lower levels in other tissues. Pex11g expression was below the level of
detection in mouse fibroblasts. Transfection of epitope-tagged PEX11G
into a human fibroblast cell line revealed colocalization with PEX14
(601791), a peroxisome marker protein. Analysis of PEX11G domains
detected in permeabilized cells suggested that PEX11G is a peroxisomal
membrane protein with both the N and C termini exposed to the cytoplasm.

Using homology with PEX11A, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified PEX11G. They
cloned the full-length PEX11G cDNA by RT-PCR of fibroblasts from a
patient with peroxisome biogenesis disorder, complementation group 11
(601757). The deduced 241-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 27 kD. PEX11G contains 2 membrane-spanning segments. By
differential permeabilization, Tanaka et al. (2003) confirmed that the N
and C termini of PEX11G are exposed to the cytosol.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2002) found that Pex11g expression in mouse liver was not
induced by ciprofibrate, and no change in Pex11g expression was detected
in cells lacking either Pex11a or Pex11b. Overexpression of PEX11G did
not increase peroxisome abundance, but induced tubulation, enlargement,
and clustering of peroxisomes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2003) mapped the PEX11G
gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

610130	TITLE *610130 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 26 (SULFATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 1; SLC26A1
;;SULFATE ANION TRANSPORTER 1; SAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC26A1 belongs to a family of transporters that mediate electroneutral
exchange of Cl- for HCO3- across the plasma membrane (Lohi et al.,
2000).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human kidney mRNA using primers derived from the mouse
Slc26a1 cDNA, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Regeer et al. (2003)
cloned SLC26A1. They also identified a SLC26A1 variant lacking exon 2 in
the 5-prime UTR. The deduced 701-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 75 kD. It has 12 putative transmembrane domains
and intracellular N and C termini. SLC26A1 contains a sulfate
transporter signature, a phosphopantetheine attachment site, a STAS
domain, a sulfate transporter family sequence, 2 putative extracellular
N-glycosylation sites, and multiple putative intracellular
phosphorylation sites. PCR analysis showed highest expression in kidney
and liver, with lower expression in brain, colon, thymus, spleen, small
intestine, leukocytes, pancreas, testis, and prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Regeer et al. (2003) found that Xenopus oocytes injected with SLC26A1
cRNA showed 40-fold induction of sulfate uptake, 5-fold induction of
chloride uptake, and 6-fold induction of oxalate uptake compared with
water-injected controls. Formate was not a transport substrate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Regeer et al. (2003) determined that the SLC26A1 gene spans 5.8 kb and
contains 4 exons, with translation initiation beginning in exon 3. The
5-prime flanking region is 60% GC rich, lacks canonical TATA and CAAT
boxes, and has a large number of potential cis-acting elements
recognized by transcription factors. Regeer et al. (2003) identified a
minimal promoter containing an AP1 (165160) site that was essential for
transcription.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Lohi et al. (2000) mapped the SLC26A1 gene
to chromosome 4p16.3.

RNA POLYMERASE II, 7.6-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (EC 2.7.7.6) is responsible for the
transcription of protein-encoding genes. It is composed of 10 to 14
subunits ranging in mass from approximately 220 kD (POLR2A; 180660) to
approximately 7 kD (POLR2K; 606033). For general information on the
structure and function of RNA polymerase II, see 180660.

CLONING

Acker et al. (1996) reported the characterization of the gene encoding
the 7.6-kD subunit of RNA polymerase II. The authors showed the gene to
be transcribed as a single RNA. The predicted 67-amino acid peptide is
highly similar to the corresponding subunit from other species,
including the yeast RPB10 gene product, and contains conserved cysteine
residues that are characteristic of an atypical zinc-binding domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

The POLR2L gene consists of 2 exons separated by a 2.1-kb intron. (Acker
et al., 1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Shpakovski et al. (1995) showed that a human cDNA for POLR2L was able to
complement the yeast homolog. The yeast protein is shared in complexes
of RNA polymerases I, II, and III and Acker et al. (1996) suggested that
this may also be true in mammalian cells.

McKune et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs corresponding to the genes for
POLR2L and POLR2H (606023), the latter being the human homolog of S.
cerevisiae RPB8. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both POLR2L
and POLR2H are stable and assemble efficiently with yeast RNA pol II.
The yeast RPB8 and RPB10 genes are essential for cell growth and
viability.

MAPPING

Acker et al. (1996) mapped the POLR2L gene to 11p15 by in situ
hybridization.

SH3 PROTEIN INTERACTING WITH NCK, 90-KD; SPIN90
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sano et al. (2000) identified the NCKIPSD gene, which they called
AF3p21, as a novel fusion partner of the MLL gene (159555) in a
23-year-old patient who developed therapy-related leukemia (AML, FAB
M5b) with t(3;11)(p21;q23). Hayakawa et al. (2001) further characterized
the AF3p21 gene. AF3p21 encodes a nuclear protein consisting of 722
amino acids with an SH3 domain, a proline-rich domain, and a bipartite
nuclear localization signal. The protein's SH3 domain has high homology
with that of FYN (137025). Dot blot RNA analysis showed that the AF3p21
gene was expressed in all adult and embryonic human tissues examined,
including bone marrow, brain, liver, thymus, lung, and skeletal muscle.
Northern blot analysis of HeLa cell RNA detected a 3.5-kb transcript.
The protein had an apparent molecular mass of 80 kD and localized
exclusively in the cell nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hayakawa et al. (2001) determined that the NCKIPSD gene spans 19 kb and
contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

Sano et al. (2000) mapped the NCKIPSD gene to chromosome 3p21.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down and immunoprecipitation analysis, Rahimi et al.
(2012) found that the SH3 domain of SPIN90 interacted with the
proline-rich C terminus of IGPR1 (TMIGD2; 614715). Overexpression or
knockdown of either protein increased or reduced, respectively, tube
formation by mouse or human endothelial cells in 3-dimensional culture.
Rahimi et al. (2012) hypothesized that interaction between IGPR1 and
SPIN90 regulates angiogenesis.

CYTOGENETICS

Sano et al. (2000) identified the AF3p21 gene as a novel fusion partner
of the MLL gene (159555) in a 23-year-old patient who developed
therapy-related leukemia (AML, FAB M5b) with t(3;11)(p21;q23). Hayakawa

;;FUSE-BINDING PROTEIN-INTERACTING REPRESSOR; FIR;;
FBP-INTERACTING REPRESSOR;;
SIAH-BINDING PROTEIN 1; SIAHBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The far upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein (FBP, or FUBP1; 603444)
binds the single-stranded FUSE of active MYC genes, possesses potent
transcription activation and repression domains, and is necessary for
MYC expression. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Liu et al. (2000)
identified a novel 60-kD protein, which they named 'FBP-interacting
repressor' (FIR), that blocks activator-dependent, but not basal,
transcription through TFIIH (see 189972). FIR is a 542-amino acid
protein that is identical to the seven-in-absentia homolog (SIAH;
602212)-binding protein-1. Recruited through the nucleic acid-binding
domain of FBP, FIR forms a ternary complex with FBP and FUSE. FIR
repressed a MYC reporter via the FUSE. The N terminus of FIR contains an
activator-selective repression domain capable of acting in cis or in
trans in vivo and in vitro. The repression domain of FIR targets only
the p89 helicase of TFIIH, which is required at several stages in
transcription, but not factors required for promoter selection. Thus,
FIR locks TFIIH in an activation-resistant configuration that still
supports basal transcription. Northern blot analysis detected FIR
expression in all tissues tested, with relatively higher levels in
testis and ovary.

GENE FUNCTION

Inherited mutations of the TFIIH helicase subunits XPB (133510) or XPD
(278730) yield overlapping DNA repair and transcription syndromes. The
high risk of cancer in these patients is not fully explained by the
repair defect. The transcription defect, however, is subtle and more
difficult to evaluate. Liu et al. (2001) showed that XPB and XPD
mutations block transcription activation by FBP, a regulator of MYC
(190080) expression, and block repression by FIR. Through TFIIH, FBP
facilitates transcription until promoter escape, whereas after
initiation, FIR uses TFIIH to delay promoter escape. Mutations in TFIIH
that impair regulation by FBP and FIR affect proper regulation of MYC
expression and have implications in the development of malignancy.

614551	TITLE *614551 SERINE INCORPORATOR 5; SERINC5
;;CHROMOSOME 5 OPEN READING FRAME 12; C5ORF12;;
TPO1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SERINC5 belongs to the SERINC family of transmembrane proteins that
facilitate the incorporation of serine into phosphatidylserine and
sphingolipids (Inuzuka et al., 2005).

CLONING

Xu et al. (2003) cloned SERINC5, which they called C5ORF12, from a fetal
brain cDNA library. The deduced 423-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 47 kD. It has 10 transmembrane domains, a putative
N-terminal signal sequence, a TMS/TDE domain, 2 nonclassic zinc-finger
motifs, and sites for N-myristoylation, phosphorylation, and lipoprotein
lipid attachment.

By in situ hybridization of rat brain, Inuzuka et al. (2005) found that
Serinc5 expression was high in white matter, such as external capsule,
corpus callosum, and arbor vitae of cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Inuzuka et al. (2005) found that expression of Serinc5 was downregulated
in rat hippocampal CA fields and dentate gyrus following kainate-induced
seizures. Expression of Serinc5 in E. coli enhanced the activity of
phosphatidylserine synthase (see 612792). Expression of Serinc5 in COS
cells significantly enhanced the activity of both phosphatidylserine
synthase and serine palmitoyltransferase (see 605712).

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2003) determined that the SERINC5 gene contains 13 exons and
spans about 145 kb. The 5-prime region is extremely GC rich and includes
a CpG island.

MAPPING

Xu et al. (2003) stated that SERINC5 is represented by a genomic clone
from chromosome 5p13. However, Gross (2012) mapped the SERINC5 gene to
chromosome 5q14.1 based on an alignment of the SERINC5 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC101280) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609503	TITLE *609503 TESTICULAR HAPLOID EXPRESSED GENE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; THEG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Theg,
followed by 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR of a testis cDNA library, Mannan et
al. (2000) cloned 2 variants of human THEG. The deduced proteins,
THEG-major and THEG-minor, contain 379 and 355 amino acids and have
calculated molecular masses of 43.3 and 40.6 kD, respectively. Compared
with THEG-major, THEG-minor lacks 24 amino acids encoded by exon 3. Both
proteins contain several nuclear localization signals. RNA dot blot and
Northern blot analyses detected a 1.5-kb THEG transcript only in testis.
Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse testis sections detected Theg in
the nucleus of round spermatids, but not in other germ cell stages or in
somatic cells of testis. Transfected mouse fibroblasts expressed
fluorescence-tagged Theg predominantly in the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Yanaka et al. (2000) determined that mouse
Theg interacted with Cct-epsilon (CCT5; 610150), suggesting that THEG
functions as a regulatory factor in protein assembly.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mannan et al. (2000) determined that the THEG gene contains 8 exons and
spans 14 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Mannan et al. (2000) mapped the
THEG gene to chromosome 19pter-p13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanaka et al. (2000) found that the Theg gene was disrupted in an
insertional transgenic mouse mutant, termed kisimo, characterized by
male sterility. Mutant males showed abnormal germ cell development, with
elongated spermatids in the lumina of seminiferous tubules.

In contrast to the findings of Yanaka et al. (2000), Mannan et al.
(2003) found that Theg knockout did not affect the fertility of mutant
male mice. Theg-null males appeared normal, with no gross abnormalities
in testicular morphology or sperm properties.

;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE PTPL1;;
FAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE 1; FAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-based approach, Saras et al. (1994) cloned a cytoplasmic
protein tyrosine phosphatase of nonreceptor type, which they designated
PTPL1. Overlapping cDNA clones encompassed an open reading frame of
7,398 bp, predicting a 2,466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of
275 kD. PTPL1 was found to have a wide tissue distribution, a 9.5-kb
transcript being expressed in most tissues. PTPL1 has a protein-tyrosine
phosphatase domain located in the C terminus. In the nonenzymatic part
of PTPL1, 3 different structural motifs were identified; 2 of these are
often found in proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and
the cytoskeleton, namely, a domain with similarity to the band 4.1
(130500) superfamily, and a region consisting of 5 copies of an 80-amino
acid repeat found in a variety of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. In
addition, PTPL1 has a leucine zipper motif. Saras et al. (1994) noted
that PTPL1 was the largest known PTP and the only one known to contain a
leucine zipper motif. Its structure suggests that it may be able to form
dimers and may localize to the submembranous cytoskeleton.

Both Banville et al. (1994) and Maekawa et al. (1994) isolated the same
nonreceptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN13, which they
referred to as hPTP1E and PTP-BAS, respectively. Maekawa et al. (1994)
originally isolated a PCR product from basophil mRNA using degenerate
primers and RT-PCR. This was used as a probe to screen a
basophil-enriched KU812E cell cDNA library. The fully characterized cDNA
was over 8.1 kb and encoded a 2,485-amino acid predicted reading frame.
The Banville et al. (1994) cDNA was isolated by screening a ZR-75-1
breast carcinoma cell line at low stringency with a probe for LAR cDNA
(179590). The cDNA they identified was over 8.3 kb long and encoded a
2,490-amino acid reading frame. Both groups noted that the N-terminal
region contains motifs showing similarity to the GLGF motifs found in
guanylate kinase proteins that may play a role in the subcellular
distribution of these proteins within specialized structures of the cell
membrane where cell-cell interactions occur. Maekawa et al. (1994)
presented evidence for alternative splicing producing at least 3
different isoforms of PTPN13. Banville et al. (1994) expressed the
protein in E. coli and showed that the recombinant protein had the
expected protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Northern blot analysis
showed expression in a variety of tissues with especially high levels in
the kidney, lung, and fetal brain.

PTPN13 binds to a negative regulatory domain in Fas that inhibits
Fas-induced apoptosis; it has therefore also been called Fas-associated
protein-tyrosine-1 (FAP1) (Inazawa et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yoshida et al. (2002) determined that the PTPN13 gene is located only
633 bp upstream from JNK3 (602897) in a head-to-head orientation. A
short G/C-rich region between the cap sites of the 2 genes suggested
that they might share a bidirectional promoter region that appears to
contain multiple cis elements. They found that the PTPN13 gene, which
contains 48 exons, initiates transcription within exon 2 and terminates
in exon 48.

MAPPING

Banville et al. (1994) assigned the PTPN13 gene to chromosome 11 by PCR
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. In an erratum, they stated that the gene
had been assigned to chromosome 4 and not 11 as reported.

Inazawa et al. (1996) localized the PTPN13 gene to 4q21.3 by both
fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids. They noted that the 4q21.3 chromosomal region contains a gene
for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (173910) and is
frequently deleted in liver and ovarian cancers.

The assignment to 4q21 was confirmed by van den Maagdenberg et al.
(1996) who also mapped the gene to mouse chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed a mutational analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF, 179590; PTPRG,
176886; PTPRT, 608712; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

609699	TITLE *609699 MONOGLYCERIDE LIPASE; MGLL
;;MGL;;
MONOACYLGLYCEROL LIPASE; MAGL;;
HUK5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Monoglyceride lipase (MGLL; EC 3.1.1.23) functions together with
hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE; 151750) to hydrolyze intracellular
triglyceride stores in adipocytes and other cells to fatty acids and
glycerol. MGLL may also complement lipoprotein lipase (LPL; 238600) in
completing hydrolysis of monoglycerides resulting from degradation of
lipoprotein triglycerides (Karlsson et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to a
lysophospholipase gene from ectromelia virus, Wall et al. (1997)
identified human MGLL, which they designated HUK5. The deduced 313-amino
acid protein shares 49.5% identity with the virus protein. Database
analysis indicated that MGLL is expressed in wide variety of tissues and
may be preferentially expressed in adipose.

By RT-PCR of adipocyte total RNA using primers based on mouse Mgl,
followed by screening an adipocyte cDNA library, Karlsson et al. (2001)
cloned human MGL. The deduced 303-amino acid protein shares 84% identity
with mouse Mgl. Mouse and human MGL both have an N-terminal his-gly
dipeptide, a characteristic of lipases, and a catalytic triad of ser122,
asp239, and his269. By EST database analysis, Karlsson et al. (2001)
identified mouse and human MGL transcripts containing 2 different
5-prime leader sequences. Northern blot analysis of human adipocyte
total RNA detected a 4.2-kb MGL transcript. MGL expression was also
detected in lung, liver, kidney, brain, and heart. Western blot analysis
of mouse tissues showed ubiquitous expression, but the pattern was
tissue specific with regard to both the size and number of Mgl proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Dinh et al. (2002) found that rat Mgl participates in inactivation of
2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endogenous cannabinoid monoglyceride.
Mgl was highly expressed in regions of rat brain that also expressed
cannabinoid receptors (see CNR1; 114610), and it appeared to assume a
presynaptic localization in hippocampus. Adenovirus-mediated transfer of
Mgl cDNA into rat cortical neurons increased Mgl expression and
attenuated 2-AG accumulation induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate/carbachol.

Nomura et al. (2010) found that KIAA1363 (NCEH1; 613234) and MAGL were
consistently elevated in aggressive human cancer cells relative to their
nonaggressive counterparts. The authors suggested that enrichment of
protumorigenic lipid signaling molecules in aggressive cancer cells
supports their malignant phenotype.

Nomura et al. (2011) demonstrated that a distinct pathway exists in
brain, where MAGL hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol
to generate a major arachidonate precursor pool for neuroinflammatory
prostaglandins. MAGL-disrupted animals showed neuroprotection in a
parkinsonian mouse model. These animals were spared the hemorrhaging
caused by COX inhibitors in the gut, where prostaglandins are instead
regulated by cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2); see 611651). Nomura
et al. (2011) concluded that their findings identified MAGL as a
distinct metabolic node that couples endocannabinoid to prostaglandin
signaling networks in the nervous system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Karlsson et al. (2001) determined that the mouse and human MGLL genes
contain 7 exons. Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Analysis Consortium mapped the MGLL
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP SHGC-31856).

Karlsson et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Mgll gene to a region of
chromosome 6 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 3q21.

608933	TITLE *608933 ENDONUCLEASE VIII-LIKE 2; NEIL2
;;NEI2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NEIL2 belongs to a class of DNA glycosylases homologous to the bacterial
Fpg/Nei family. These glycosylases initiate the first step in base
excision repair by cleaving bases damaged by reactive oxygen species and
introducing a DNA strand break via the associated lyase reaction
(Bandaru et al., 2002)

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences similar to the Arabidopsis DNA
glycosylase Fpg, Bandaru et al. (2002) identified NEIL2. Bacterial
Fpg/Nei proteins contain 2 structural domains: an N-terminal 2-layered
beta sandwich and a C-terminal 4-helix bundle, which includes a
helix-2-turns-helix (H2TH) motif and a zinc finger. The deduced
332-amino acid human NEIL2 protein has conserved residues in 6 highly
conserved regions that span both structural domains of the bacterial
Fpg/Nei proteins, but it has an unusual CHCC zinc finger.

Using Northern blot analysis, Hazra et al. (2002) detected a 2.4-kb
NEIL2 transcript. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle and testis,
moderate in brain and heart, and low in all other tissues examined.
Analysis of NEIL2 expression in synchronized human diploid fibroblasts
indicated that, unlike expression of NEIL1 (608844), expression of NEIL2
is independent of the cell cycle. Epitope-tagged NEIL2 was expressed in
nuclei of transfected cells, although a small fraction was also observed
in the cytoplasm. The deduced NEIL2 protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 36.7 kD, but bacterially-expressed NEIL2 showed an apparent
molecular mass of 42 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Hazra et al. (2002) characterized recombinant NEIL2 following expression
in E. coli. The enzyme showed DNA glycosylase/abasic lyase activity,
primarily for excising oxidative products of cytosine, with highest
activity for 5-hydroxyuracil. NEIL2 showed lower activity for
5,6-dihydrouracil and 5-hydroxycytosine, and negligible or undetectable
activity with 8-oxoguanine, thymine glycol, 2-hydroxyadenine,
hypoxanthine, and xanthine. Hazra et al. (2002) concluded that NEIL2 is
involved in global genome repair, mainly for removing oxidative products
of cytosine.

Dou et al. (2003) found that both NEIL2 and NEIL1 bound 5-hydroxyuracil
contained within bubble DNA, contrasting strongly with NTH1 (602656) and
OGG1 (601982), which did not produce stable complexes with either
single-strand DNA or a DNA bubble. NEIL2 had much higher activity for
excising 5-hydroxyuracil in bubble DNA than with duplex or single-strand
DNA. NEIL2 could also excise 8-oxoguanine when it was placed inside a
bubble.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bandaru et al. (2002) determined that the NEIL2 gene contains 4 exons.

;;CADHERIN, VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL, 2; VECAD2;;
VE-CADHERIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Murine vascular endothelial cadherin-2 is a cellular adhesion molecule
that is distinct from vascular endothelial cadherin-1 (CDH5; 601120) in
that it does not interact with catenins and does not appear to affect
cell migration or growth (Telo et al., 1998). By sequence database
searching, Wu and Maniatis (2000) identified a human VE-cadherin-2
homolog, which they called protocadherin-12 (PCDH12), encoding a deduced
1,184-amino acid protein that shares 81% sequence identity with the
mouse protein.

Using the mouse Pcdh12 cDNA sequence and RACE-PCR reactions, Ludwig et
al. (2000) cloned a full-length PCDH12 cDNA from a human fetal kidney
cDNA library. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 5-kb
PCHD12 transcript chiefly in highly vascularized tissues including the
heart and placenta, but most tissues contained a low level of
expression. Prominent expression was also detected in the spleen. Some
tissues, including skeletal muscle and peripheral blood leukocytes,
possessed transcripts of a larger size.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu and Maniatis (2000) determined that the PCDH12 gene contains 4 exons;
a single large exon encodes the extracellular and transmembrane domains,
and 3 small exons encode the cytoplasmic domain. Wu and Maniatis (2000)
concluded that the presence of unusually large exons is a characteristic
feature of protocadherin.

Ludwig et al. (2000) found that the entire PCDH12 coding region was
contained within 13 kb of genomic sequence.

MAPPING

Ludwig et al. (2000) identified the human PCDH12 sequence within a BAC
clone encompassing 186 kb on chromosome 5q31.

603132	TITLE *603132 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 189; ZNF189
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kruppel-like zinc finger proteins such as ZNF189 contain a conserved
stretch of 7 amino acids that connects a variable number of DNA-binding
zinc finger repeats of the cys(2)his(2) (C2H2) type. Approximately 30%
of human Kruppel-like zinc finger proteins contain an N-terminal
Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. The KRAB domain consists of
approximately 75 amino acids that may be subdivided into an A box, which
is present in every KRAB domain and is essential for transcriptional
repression, and a B box, which is not always present (summary by Odeberg
et al., 1998).

CLONING

Odeberg et al. (1998) cloned human bone marrow cDNAs representing 4
differentially spliced ZNF189 transcripts that differ in their 5-prime
coding regions. The exons encode a predicted KRAB A domain at the N
terminus, a spacer region, and 16 zinc finger motifs at the C terminus;
all identified splice variants encode the spacer region and zinc finger
domain. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that ZNF189 was expressed in
all tissues and cell types investigated, with the different splice
variants showing tissue- or cell type-restricted expression patterns.
This expression analysis also detected 2 additional unidentified splice
variants. Odeberg et al. (1998) stated that the ZNF189 gene is
well-conserved in several mammalian species.

GENE STRUCTURE

Odeberg et al. (1998) determined that the ZNF189 gene spans
approximately 11 kb and contains at least 4 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Odeberg et al. (1998) mapped the
ZNF189 gene to 9q22-q31.

604518	TITLE *604518 GRB2-RELATED ADAPTOR PROTEIN 2; GRAP2
;;GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR-BOUND PROTEIN 2-RELATED ADAPTOR PROTEIN 2;;
GRB2-RELATED PROTEIN WITH INSERT DOMAIN; GRID;;
GADS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Src homology-2 (SH2)- and SH3-containing adaptor molecules recruit
cytosolic signal-transducing molecules to activated receptor tyrosine
kinases. Using the multisubstrate docking protein GAB1 (604439) as bait
in a yeast 2-hybrid system, Qiu et al. (1998) isolated human lymphocyte
cDNAs encoding GRAP2. The predicted 330-amino acid GRAP2 protein
contains an SH2 domain flanked by 2 SH3 domains. These domains are
arranged in the same configuration as, and share a high degree of amino
acid identity with, the SH2 and SH3 domains of the GRB2 (108355) and
GRAP (604330) proteins. However, GRAP2 contains an additional 120-amino
acid glutamine-rich domain between its SH2 domain and C-terminal SH3
domain. The interaction of GRAP2 with GAB1 appears to be mediated
through its C-terminal SH3 domain. Northern blot analysis detected major
1.4- and 4.0-kb GRAP2 transcripts in thymus, spleen, peripheral blood
leukocytes, and chronic myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia cell
lines, with the highest expression in thymus. Qiu et al. (1998)
concluded that GRAP2 is a divergent member of the GRB2/Sem5/Drk family
and suggested that it is an adaptor-like protein involved in
leukocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase signaling.

By yeast 3-hybrid analysis using the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 (186760)
phosphorylated by coexpression of LCK (153390), Ellis et al. (2000)
cloned GRAP2, which they termed GRID (GRB2-related protein with insert
domain). They identified a conservative point mutation at position 388
of GRAP2 and a nonconservative mutation at position 954, resulting in a
putative polymorphism, leu320 to phe. Immunoblot analysis showed that
the SH2 domain of GRAP2 associates preferentially with
tyr173-phosphorylated CD28 early after CD28 activation, but not with
CTLA4 (123890) or CD3Z (186780). Binding is enhanced through
interactions between the GRAP2 C-terminal SH3 domain and an N-terminal
PRRP recognition motif of CD28. Ellis et al. (2000) found that GRAP2
also associates with SOS2 (601247), via the GRAP2 C-terminal SH3 domain,
and with SLP76 (LCP2; 601603), DOK1 (602919), and RACK1 (GNB2L1; 176981)
in either resting or activated cells. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis
indicated that GRAP2 is principally expressed in T cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Ellis et al. (2000) determined that the
GRAP2 gene contains 8 exons and spans 144 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ellis et al. (2000) mapped the GRAP2 gene
to 22q12-qter.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoder et al. (2001) noted that GRAP2, which they termed GADS, is
implicated in CD3 signaling. CD3 cross-linking induces the
phosphorylation of the adaptor proteins SLP76 and LAT (602354). GADS is
constitutively associated with SLP76 and is recruited to LAT upon T-cell
receptor (TCR) activation. Yoder et al. (2001) generated Gads-deficient
mice through gene targeting and found that the apparently healthy mice
had fewer thymocytes than wildtype mice and that the thymocytes had
several developmental defects. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated
that thymocytes from Gads-deficient mice exhibited a severe
developmental arrest at the pro-T3 (CD44 (107269)-negative/CD25
(147730)-positive) stage, resulting in lower numbers of pro-T4
(CD44-negative/CD25-negative) stage cells. Immunoprecipitation and
immunoblot analysis showed that upon CD3 cross-linking the Gads-negative
thymocytes were able to increase SLP76 phosphorylation, but SLP76 did
not associate with LAT and did not phosphorylate and activate PLCG1
(172420). Flow cytometric analysis indicated that Gads was not required
for B-cell activation. Yoder et al. (2001) concluded that GADS is
important for pre-TCR and TCR signaling and for CD4 lineage maturation,
although Gads deficiency is less severe than Slp76 deficiency in mice.

609278	TITLE *609278 IZUMO SPERM-EGG FUSION PROTEIN 1; IZUMO1
;;SPERM-SPECIFIC PROTEIN IZUMO;;
MGC34799
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The sperm-specific protein Izumo, named for a Japanese shrine dedicated
to marriage, is essential for sperm-egg plasma membrane binding and
fusion (Inoue et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using a monoclonal antibody against mouse sperm that inhibits the fusion
process, followed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and
immunoblotting, Inoue et al. (2005) identified a mouse sperm
fusion-related antigen that they termed Izumo. Mass spectrometry, RT-PCR
analysis of testis RNA, and database searching elucidated the DNA
sequence and identified a human homolog (GenBank GENBANK BC034769). The
predicted human gene encodes a 350-amino acid type I membrane protein of
the Ig superfamily containing an extracellular Ig domain with a putative
glycosylation site. Western blot analysis detected a 37-kD protein on
the sperm surface after the exocytotic acrosome reaction process but not
on fresh sperm. Anti-IZUMO, but not control, polyclonal antibody
treatment inhibited fusion with zona pellucida-free hamster eggs.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inoue et al. (2005) generated mice deficient in Izumo by homologous
recombination with deletion of exons 2 through 10 and observed healthy
mice with fertile females but sterile males with normal reproductive
behavior and sperm migration to the perivitelline spaces. In vitro
fertilization analysis confirmed the sterility of Izumo -/- sperm.
Heterozygote males had no impairment of fertility. Intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) using mutant sperm resulted in successful
fertilization of eggs that implanted normally and developed to term.

;;EED, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
WD PROTEIN ASSOCIATING WITH INTEGRIN CYTOPLASMIC TAILS 1; WAIT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In Drosophila, the Polycomb-group (PcG) and trithorax-group (trxG) genes
are part of a cellular memory system responsible for the stable
inheritance of gene activity. PcG and trxG genes are repressors and
activators, respectively, of Drosophila homeotic gene expression. ENX1
(EZH2; 601573) is a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila 'enhancer of
zeste' gene and has domains with sequence homology to both PcG and trxG
genes. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with ENX1 as bait, followed by
screening a fetal brain cDNA library, Sewalt et al. (1998) isolated a
cDNA encoding EED. EED is the human homolog of Eed, a murine PcG gene
homologous to the Drosophila homeotic gene, 'extra sex combs.' The
predicted 535-amino acid human EED protein is 100% identical to the
murine protein. The N-terminal region of EED contains a putative PEST
sequence, which is implicated in protein degradation, and there are 5
WD40 domains throughout the EED protein. WD40 domains are involved in
protein-protein interactions, and Sewalt et al. (1998) showed that all 5
are necessary for the ENX1-EED interaction to occur. Northern blot
analysis detected 1.5- and 2.0-kb EED transcripts in all tissues and
cell lines tested; larger transcripts were detected in normal human
tissues only, but at much lower levels. Highest expression was found in
testis, spleen, prostate, ovary, and small intestine, as well as in
colorectal adenocarcinoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, and osteosarcoma
cell lines, with lower levels in thymus, colon, and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

Beta-7 integrins (ITGB7; 147559) are involved in the development and/or
progression of diseases such as colitis, diabetic insulitis, and
lymphoid malignancies, and they play an important role for physiologic
functions and pathologic alterations of the immune system. Using a yeast
2-hybrid screen on a Jurkat cell cDNA library with the cytoplasmic tail
of ITGB7 as bait, Rietzler et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding EED,
which they designated WAIT1. The deduced 441-amino acid protein has a
region homologous to a repeat motif in the RCC1 protein (179710) and a
region homologous to a repeat motif from the beta subunit of
heterotrimeric G proteins (see 139380).

GENE FUNCTION

Sewalt et al. (1998) found that ENX1 and EED coimmunoprecipitate,
indicating that they also interact in vivo. They do not, however,
interact with other PcG proteins, such as PC2 (603079) and BMI1
(164831). Furthermore, ENX1 and EED do not colocalize with HPC2 or BMI1
in nuclear domains of U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells.

Rietzler et al. (1998) demonstrated that EED interacts with the ITGB7
cytoplasmic tail, which regulates receptor avidity and signaling, by
coprecipitation from transiently transfected 293 cells. Tyr735 of ITGB7
was critical for the interaction. EED also interacts with the
cytoplasmic domains of ITGA4 (192975) and ITGAE (604682), but not with
those of ITGB1 (135630), ITGB2 (600065), and ITGAL (153370). The authors
concluded that EED may act as a specific regulator of integrin function.

Peytavi et al. (1999) isolated cDNAs encoding EED using the yeast
2-hybrid system on an activated lymphocyte cDNA library with the human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) matrix (MA) protein as bait. EED was
found to bind MA in vitro and in vivo in yeast cells. The MA and EED
proteins colocalized within the nucleus of cotransfected human cells.
This and the failure of EED to bind to uncleaved GAG precursor suggested
a role for EED at the early stages of virus infection, rather than late
in the virus life cycle.

In marsupials and the extraembryonic region of the mouse, X inactivation
is imprinted: the paternal X chromosome is preferentially inactivated
whereas the maternal X is always active. Having more than 1 active X
chromosome is deleterious to extraembryonic development in the mouse.
Wang et al. (2001) showed that the eed gene is required for primary and
secondary trophoblast giant cell development in female embryos. Results
from mice carrying a paternally inherited X-linked GFP transgene
implicated eed in the stable maintenance of imprinted X inactivation in
extraembryonic tissues. Based on the recent finding that the EED protein
interacts with histone deacetylases, Wang et al. (2001) suggested that
this maintenance activity involves hypoacetylation of the inactivated
paternal X chromosome in the extraembryonic tissues.

Cao et al. (2002) reported the purification and characterization of an
EED-EZH2 complex, the human counterpart of the Drosophila ESC-E(Z)
complex. Cao et al. (2002) demonstrated that the complex specifically
methylates nucleosomal histone H3 (see 602812) at lysine-27 (H3-K27).
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, Cao et al. (2002) showed
that H3-K27 methylation colocalizes with, and is dependent on, E(Z)
binding at an 'Ultrabithorax' (Ubx) Polycomb response element, and that
this methylation correlates with Ubx expression. Methylation on H3-K27
facilitates binding of Polycomb, a component of the Polycomb repressive
complex 1 (PRC1 complex), to the histone H3 N-terminal tail. Thus, Cao
et al. (2002) concluded that their studies established a link between
histone methylation and Polycomb group-mediated gene silencing. The
complex responsible for histone methyltransferase activity includes EZH2
(601573), SUZ12 (606245), and EED. EZH2 contains a SET domain, a
signature motif for all known histone lysine methyltransferases except
the H3-K79 methyltransferase DOT1, and is therefore likely to be the
catalytic subunit.

Plath et al. (2003) demonstrated that transient recruitment of the
EED-EZH2 complex to the inactive X chromosome occurs during initiation
of X inactivation in both extraembryonic and embryonic cells and is
accompanied by H3-K27 methylation. Recruitment of the complex and
methylation on the inactive X depend on Xist (314670) RNA but are
independent of its silencing function. Plath et al. (2003) concluded
that taken together, their results suggest a role for EED-EZH2-mediated
H3-K27 methylation during initiation of both imprinted and random X
inactivation and demonstrate that H3-K27 methylation is not sufficient
for silencing of the inactive X.

To gain insight into the role of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins in
embryonic stem (ES) cells, Boyer et al. (2006) identified the genes
occupied by PcG proteins in murine ES cells by performing genomewide
location analysis using antibodies against core components of PRC1
(Phc1, 602978 and Rnf2, 608985) and PRC2 (Suz12 and Eed). Boyer et al.
(2006) found that the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2
co-occupied 512 genes, many of which encode transcription factors with
important roles in development. All of the co-occupied genes contained
modified nucleosomes (trimethylated lys27 on histone H3; see 602810).
Consistent with a causal role in gene silencing in ES cells, PcG target
genes were derepressed in cells deficient for the PRC2 component Eed,
and were preferentially activated on induction of differentiation. Boyer
et al. (2006) concluded that dynamic repression of developmental
pathways by Polycomb complexes may be required for maintaining ES cell
pluripotency and plasticity during embryonic development.

By mass spectrometric analysis, Higa et al. (2006) identified over 20
WD40 repeat-containing (WDR) proteins that interacted with the CUL4 (see
603137)-DDB1 (600045)-ROC1 (RBX1; 603814) complex, including EED.
Sequence alignment revealed that most of the interacting WDR proteins
had a centrally positioned WDxR/K submotif. Knockdown studies suggested
that the WDR proteins functioned as substrate-specific adaptors. For
example, inactivation of L2DTL (DTL; 610617), but not other WDR
proteins, prevented CUL4-DDB1-dependent proteolysis of CDT1 (605525)
following gamma irradiation. Inactivation of WDR5 (609012) or EED, but
not other WDR proteins, altered the pattern of CUL4-DDB1-dependent
histone H3 methylation.

The gene silencing activity of the Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2;
see 601674) depends on its ability to trimethylate lys27 of histone 3
(H3K27) by the catalytic SET domain of the EZH2 (601573) subunit and at
least 2 other subunits of the complex: SUZ12 (606245) and EED. Margueron
et al. (2009) showed that the carboxy-terminal domain of EED
specifically binds to histone tails carrying trimethyl-lysine residues
associated with repressive chromatin marks, and that this leads to the
allosteric activation of the methyltransferase activity of PRC2.
Mutations in EED that prevent it from recognizing repressive
trimethyl-lysine marks abolished the activation of PRC2 in vitro and, in
Drosophila, reduced global methylation and disrupted development.
Margueron et al. (2009) concluded that their findings suggested a model
for the propagation of the H3K27 methyl-3 mark that accounts for the
maintenance of repressive chromatin domains and for the transmission of
a histone modification from mother to daughter cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Schumacher et al. (1998) mapped the EED gene to 11q14.2-q22.3.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

COPE is a subunit of the heptameric coatomer protein complex, or COPI
(see 601924), which mediates transport between the Golgi complex and
endoplasmic reticulum.

CLONING

Shima et al. (1999) reported the cloning of COPE, which encodes a
308-amino acid protein. Time-lapse microscopy showed that COPE, as a
marker of COPI, is found on tubulovesicular transport complexes
shuttling anterograde, but rarely retrograde, cargo to the Golgi
complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the COPE
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG29914).

600939	TITLE *600939 INTERLEUKIN 11 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; IL11RA
IL11RA/GALT SPLICED READ-THROUGH TRANSCRIPT, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interleukin-11 (IL11; 147681) is a stromal cell-derived cytokine with
multiple biologic activities on lymphohematopoietic cells. It belongs to
a family of pleiotropic and redundant cytokines that use the gp130
(IL6ST; 600694) transducing subunit in their high-affinity receptors. By
amplifying human cDNA libraries with oligonucleotide primers
corresponding to the conserved WSXWS motif found in the hematopoietic
cytokine receptor family, Cherel et al. (1995) identified a novel
cytokine receptor cDNA that, based on high (82%) sequence homology with
the murine Il11 receptor, appeared to encode the human IL11 receptor.
This receptor was found to be a 422-amino acid protein containing a
signal peptide followed by extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic
domains. The extracellular region has a 2-domain structure homologous to
those of the receptors for IL6R (147880) and ciliary neurotrophic factor
(CNTFR; 118946), an immunoglobulin-like domain and a cytokine
receptor-like domain. In addition, Cherel et al. (1995) identified an
isoform of the IL11 receptor that lacked the cytoplasmic domain. In
accord with the pleiotropic effects of IL11 on different hematopoietic
lineages and bone cells, the authors found IL11R transcripts in a
myelogenous leukemia cell line, a megakaryocytic leukemia cell line, an
erythroleukemia cell line, and 2 osteosarcoma cell lines.

Van Leuven et al. (1996) cloned the IL11RA gene. The protein sequence
predicted by the human gene was over 83% identical with its murine
counterpart, with very strict conservation of functionally important
domains and signatures. The mouse gene Etl2 (for enhancer trap locus-2)
was identified by enhancer trapping in transgenic mice. Simultaneously
and independently, a murine cDNA named Nr1 was reported to encode the
alpha-chain of the interleukin-11 receptor. The cloned cDNAs of Nr1 and
Etl2 coded for identical proteins, with the exceptions of a signal
peptide and the 5-prime untranslated region, which were completely
different, and a minor inconsistency in the 3-prime UTR. Van Leuven et
al. (1996) concluded that the human IL11RA gene and the mouse Etl2 gene
are homologs.

- IL11RA/GALT Spliced Read-Through Transcript

Magrangeas et al. (1998) established the existence of poly(A) site
choice and fusion splicing of 2 adjacent genes, galactose-1-phosphate
uridylyltransferase (GALT; 606999) and IL11RA, in normal human cells.
This 16-kb transcription unit contains 2 promoters (the first one
constitutive, and the second one, 8 kb downstream, highly regulated) and
2 cleavage/polyadenylation signals separated by 12 kb. The promoter from
the GALT gene yields 2 mRNAs, a 1.4-kb mRNA encoding GALT and a 3-kb
fusion mRNA when the first poly(A) site is spliced out and the second
poly(A) site is used. The 3-kb mRNA codes for a fusion protein
containing part of the GALT protein and the entire IL11RA protein. The
GALT promoter/IL11RA poly(A) transcript results from leaky termination
and alternative splicing.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Leuven et al. (1996) found that the IL11RA gene contains 13 exons
and spans nearly 10 kb of DNA.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, van Leuven et al. (1996) located
the IL11RA gene to human chromosome 9p13, a region with homology of
synteny to the mouse Etl2 gene on chromosome 4.

Cherel et al. (1996) likewise assigned the IL11RA gene to chromosome
9p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The CNTFR gene maps to the
same band, and the conserved genomic structure of IL11R and CNTFR
suggest that they may have evolved from a common ancestor.

Neuhaus et al. (1994) mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 4, which shows
homology of synteny to 9p13 where the human IL11RA gene is located.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 families with craniosynostosis and dental anomalies (CRSDA;
614188), Nieminen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for 1 nonsense
and 3 missense mutations and a 9-bp duplication in the IL11RA gene
(600939.0001-600939.0005) that segregated with disease in each family
and were not found in controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

IL13 (147683) is a major stimulator of inflammation and tissue
remodeling at sites of Th2 inflammation. Chen et al. (2005) found that
transgenic mice overexpressing Il13 specifically in lung showed
upregulation of both Il11 and Il11ra, but not Il6r, as well as
upregulation of other IL6 (147620)-type cytokines and a modest increase
in gp130. Il13 transgenic Il11ra -/- mice exhibited a decrease in the
inflammatory response seen in Il13 transgenic Il13ra +/+ mice, as well
as reduced fibrosis, hyaluronic acid accumulation, chemokine production,
and alveolar remodeling response. Il13 transgenic Il11ra -/- mice also
survived significantly longer than Il13 transgenic Il11ra +/+ mice. Chen
et al. (2005) concluded that IL11RA plays a key role in the pathogenesis
of IL13-induced inflammation and remodeling. They proposed that IL11,
which is induced simultaneously with IL13 in inflammatory disorders such
as asthma, may mediate the tissue effects of IL13.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS AND DENTAL ANOMALIES
IL11RA, ARG296TRP

In 4 affected sibs from a consanguineous Pakistani family with
craniosynostosis and dental anomalies (614188), Nieminen et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for an 886C-T transition in exon 9 of the IL11RA
gene, resulting in an arg296-to-trp (R296W) substitution at a residue
that is absolutely conserved in all mammalian Il11ra orthologs and
located within the extremely conserved second extracellular
fibronectin-type domain III (FNIII). The mutation was not found in 186
Pakistani or 214 European control samples. Functional analysis in
transfected 293T and HeLa cells demonstrated that the R296W mutation
rendered the receptor unable to mediate the IL11 (147681) signal.

CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS AND DENTAL ANOMALIES
IL11RA, PRO221ARG

In 3 affected sibs and their 2 affected cousins from a consanguineous
Pakistani pedigree with craniosynostosis and dental anomalies (614188),
Nieminen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 662C-G transversion
in exon 8 of the IL11RA gene, resulting in a pro221-to-arg (P221R)
substitution at a residue that is absolutely conserved in all mammalian
Il11ra orthologs and located within the extremely conserved second
extracellular fibronectin-type domain III (FNIII). The mutation was not
found in homozygosity in unaffected sibs that were tested, and was not
detected 186 Pakistani or other European control samples.

.0003
CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS AND DENTAL ANOMALIES
IL11RA, SER245CYS

In a Pakistani boy with craniosynostosis and dental anomalies (614188),
born of consanguineous parents, Nieminen et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 734C-G transversion in exon 8 of the IL11RA gene,
resulting in a ser245-to-cys (S245C) substitution at a residue that is
absolutely conserved in all mammalian Il11ra orthologs and located
within the extremely conserved second extracellular fibronectin-type
domain III (FNIII). The mutation was not found in homozygosity in
unaffected sibs that were tested, and was not detected in 186 Pakistani
or 214 European control samples.

CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS AND DENTAL ANOMALIES
IL11RA, GLN159TER

In a sister and brother of northern European origin with
craniosynostosis and dental anomalies (614188), Nieminen et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 475C-T transition in exon 6 of the IL11RA
gene, resulting in a gln159-to-ter (Q159X) substitution. The mutation
was not found in 186 Pakistani or 214 European control samples.

.0005
CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS AND DENTAL ANOMALIES
IL11RA, 9-BP DUP, NT916

In 2 Dutch brothers with craniosynostosis and midface hypoplasia
(614188), Nieminen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 9-bp
duplication (916_924dup) in exon 9 of the IL11RA gene, resulting in
addition of a third thr-trp-ser repeat (thr306_ser308dup) and affecting
a conserved WSXWS motif of the class I cytokine receptors in the
C-terminal end of the second FNIII domain. The unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in control samples.
Dental anomalies were not reported in this family.

608002	TITLE *608002 NEPHROCYSTIN 3; NPHP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NPHP3 is part of a complex of ciliary proteins required for renal and
cardiovascular development (Hoff et al., 2013).

CLONING

Using a homozygosity mapping strategy in a Venezuelan kindred with
adolescent nephronophthisis (NPHP3; 604387), Omran et al. (2000) mapped
the locus to 3q22. Subsequent linkage analysis in a consanguineous
German family showed that a locus associated with nephronophthisis with
Leber congenital amaurosis (Senior-Loken syndrome; see SLSN3, 606995)
also maps to the NPHP3 region (Omran et al., 2002). Olbrich et al.
(2003) refined the localization of the NPHP3 and SLSN3 loci and focused
a gene search on the genomic interval represented by the overlap of
these 2 loci, which spanned less than 1 cM and comprised 940 kb. The
longest transcript of NPHP3 contained an open reading frame of 3,990
nucleotides encoding a protein of 1,330 amino acids. The human and mouse
proteins share 88% sequence identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olbrich et al. (2003) reported that the NPHP3 genomic region comprises
27 exons and spans 40.5 kb. An additional exon 3b predicted premature
termination of translation. Other in-frame splice variants involve exons
13 and 15.

MAPPING

The NPHP3 gene maps to chromosome 3q22 (Omran et al., 2000).

GENE FUNCTION

Olbrich et al. (2003) observed moderate expression of 6.5- and 8.0-kb
transcripts in all adult human tissues studied by Northern blot
analysis. The Nphp3 gene is expressed in embryonic mouse node, kidney
tubules, retina, respiratory epithelium, liver, biliary tract, and
neural tissues. Expression in retina and liver, as well as in kidney,
was in agreement with associated tapetoretinal degeneration or hepatic
fibrosis in individuals with the mutation in the human gene NPHP3.

The similar phenotype of adolescent and juvenile nephronophthisis
suggested that the products of the NPHP genes may function in a common
pathway. Olbrich et al. (2003) demonstrated that epitope-tagged
nephrocystin, the protein mutant in NPHP1 (256100), coprecipitated with
nephrocystin-3 but not with control proteins.

Nauli et al. (2003) showed that polycystin-1 (see 601313) and
polycystin-2 (see 173910) mediate mechanosensation in the primary cilia
(monocilia) of kidney cells. Dysfunction of these proteins causes
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, probably due to the
inability to sense mechanical cues that normally regulate tissue
morphogenesis. The findings of Olbrich et al. (2003) suggested that the
NPHP genes (NPHP1, NPHP3, and NPHP4) involved in the pathogenesis of
recessive cystic kidney disease also belong to a common pathway in the
primary cilia of kidney cells.

In HEK293T cells, Bergmann et al. (2008) demonstrated that NPHP3
coprecipitated with NPHP2. Both NPHP3 and NPHP2 were able to inhibit
dishevelled-1 (DVL1; 601365)-induced canonical WNT (see WNT1; 164820)
signaling activity. Studies of Nphp3-knockout Xenopus oocytes
demonstrated defective cell movements during embryogenesis, suggesting a
role for NPHP3 in noncanonical WNT pathway activation.

Using mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Hoff et al.
(2013) found that the ciliary proteins ANKS6 (615370), NPHP3, INVS
(243305), and NEK8 (609799) interacted in a complex. The kinase domain
and a central region of NEK8 were required for interaction with human
NPHP3 and INVS and with rat Anks6. Interaction of NEK8 with NPHP3 was
enhanced by coexpression of rat Anks6. ANKS6 also interacted with HIF1AN
(606615), an oxygen sensor that hydroxylates HIF1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348)
and other ankyrin repeat proteins under normoxic conditions.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that HIF1AN facilitated
formation of a complex containing rat Anks6 and human NPHP3 and INVS.
Association of rat Anks6 with human NEK8 required hydroxylation of
Anks6. Hoff et al. (2013) concluded that oxygen-dependent hydroxylation
of ANKS6 by HIF1AN regulates the composition of the ANKS6-containing
ciliary complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Nephronophthisis 3

In the Venezuelan family in which the locus for NPHP3 (604387) was
originally mapped, Olbrich et al. (2003) found homozygosity for a
deletion of 3 bp (608002.0001). In another family with nephronophthisis
and hepatic fibrosis, they detected compound heterozygosity for a
nonsense mutation and a substitution of an evolutionarily conserved
amino acid residue (see 608002.0002). In a German family (Omran et al.,
2002) and another family with SLSN3, no mutations in NPHP3 were
detected, raising the possibility that another gene located near NPHP3
is responsible for the association of nephronophthisis and Leber
congenital amaurosis.

In 12 infants from 6 Old Order Amish families with lethal neonatal
nephronophthisis-3, Simpson et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
nonsense mutation in the NPHP3 gene (R702X; 608002.0009) substitution.
All 12 unaffected parents descended from a common ancestral couple who
lived in the community during the 19th century. Most of the pregnancies
were associated with oligohydramnios. Clinical features included cystic
kidneys, low-set ears, and small lungs with respiratory insufficiency.
One infant was reported to have situs inversus, and 2 had absent
bladder. Simpson et al. (2009) noted that few affected infants had
complete medical evaluations due to the severe nature of the disease,
and no autopsy information was available. Thus, additional extrarenal
manifestations may have been present.

Tory et al. (2009) identified 9 different NPHP3 mutations in 7 unrelated
probands with infantile-onset NPHP3 and end-stage renal failure before
age 5 years. All patients showed extrarenal manifestations, with hepatic
involvement and liver fibrosis affecting all but 1 patient. Other
extrarenal manifestations included cone-shaped epiphyses in 2, heart
valve or septal defects in 2, and retinitis pigmentosa in 1.

- Meckel Syndrome 7

Bergmann et al. (2008) reported 4 patients from 2 unrelated families
with homozygous truncating mutations in the NPHP3 gene
(608002.0004-608002.0005). The phenotype was consistent with a form of
Meckel syndrome (MKS7; 267010). Features included death in the perinatal
period or early infancy, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, hepatic ductal
plate malformations, cystic pancreas, and congenital cardiac defects.
One had Dandy-Walker malformation and 2 had other central nervous system
abnormalities, including a cyst on the floor of the right ventricle,
choroid plexus cysts, and enlarged fontanelles.

- Renal-Hepatic-Pancreatic Dysplasia 1

Bergmann et al. (2008) reported 2 unrelated patients, aged 17 and 8
years at the time of the report, with renal-hepatic-pancreatic
dysplasia-1 (RHPD1; 208540) caused by homozygous or compound
heterozygous NPHP3 mutations (608002.0006-608002.0008). Both had
combined liver-kidney transplants as children. They had normal
neurologic and cognitive assessments; one had situs inversus totalis.

Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) reported 2 Norwegian sibs, born to remotely
consanguineous parents, with lethal renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia
who were homozygous for a truncating mutation in the NPHP3 gene
(608002.0004). One sib died 1 day after birth, and the other fetus was
terminated at 16 weeks' gestation due to multiple abnormalities. One sib
had complete situs inversus of the thoracic and abdominal organs. One
brain was normal, whereas the other showed evidence of polymicrogyria.

ANIMAL MODEL

Renal pathology in adolescent NPHP is characterized by alterations of
tubular basement membranes, tubular atrophy and dilatation, sclerosing
tubulointerstitial nephropathy, and renal cyst development predominantly
at the corticomedullary junction. This phenotype resembles that observed
in the recessive pcy mouse mutant. Omran et al. (2001) showed homology
between the pcy locus on mouse chromosome 9 and the human NPHP3 locus.
Olbrich et al. (2003) considered the mouse Nphp3 gene to be a strong
candidate to harbor the pcy mutation. Nphp3 sequence analysis in pcy
mice identified a homozygous mutation, which was absent in 22 different
mouse strains including the diabetic KK strain, in which the spontaneous
pcy mutation initially arose. The mutation predicted an ile614-to-ser
(I614S) amino acid substitution.

Woo et al. (1997) identified 2 major modifier loci of polycystic disease
progression in mice with the pcy mutation. The study was prompted by the
fact that unlike the uniform disease progression in inbred animals,
polycystic kidney disease progression in human families can be highly
variable. Modifier genes were identified by study of an intercross
between DBA/2-pcy/pcy and Mus m. castaneus. The investigators observed
large differences in PKD severity in the cross. In addition, 23 of 800
phenotypically normal mice were pcy/pcy genotypically. One modifier
locus, MOP1, was located on mouse chromosome 4 and a second, MOP2, on
mouse chromosome 16.

Gattone et al. (2003) showed that the renal cystic phenotype pcy was
amenable to treatment with vasopressin-2 receptor (AVPR2; 300538)
antagonist.

Bergmann et al. (2008) found that heterozygous Nphp3-null mutant mice
had no obvious abnormalities. Mutant mice that were compound
heterozygous for the pcy mutation (I614S) and an Nphp3-null mutation
developed cystic kidneys. Cysts appeared as early as 4 weeks after birth
and increased in size and number. The findings suggested that the Pcy
allele is hypomorphic with residual protein expression. Mice homozygous
for the null allele were embryonic lethal. Analysis of Nphp3-null
embryos at different time points showed numerous lateralization defects
with various situs abnormalities. Lethality occurred midgestation.

Using antisense morpholinos, Hoff et al. (2013) found that depletion of
Anks6, Nphp3, or Nek8 in zebrafish resulted in a similar phenotype
characterized by formation of pronephric cysts and a defect in early
heart looping. In Xenopus, knockdown of Anks6, Nphp3, or Invs caused
gross body edema typical of a renal excretory defect.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEPHRONOPHTHISIS 3
NPHP3, GLY1275DEL

In a Venezuelan kindred in which 24 members had adolescent
nephronophthisis with median age at end-stage renal disease of 19 years
and no extrarenal manifestations (NPHP3; 604387), Olbrich et al. (2003)
demonstrated a 3-bp deletion of nucleotides 3823 to 3825, resulting in
the deletion of glycine-1275 (delG1275). It was in this family that the
locus for adolescent nephronophthisis was originally mapped to 3q by a
homozygosity mapping strategy (Omran et al., 2000).

.0002
NEPHRONOPHTHISIS 3
NPHP3, SER360THR

In a Yugoslavian family in which 3 members had adolescent
nephronophthisis with end-stage renal disease by ages 11 and 12 (NPHP3;
604387), with associated hepatic fibrosis, Olbrich et al. (2003) found
compound heterozygosity for mutation of the NPHP3 gene: ser360 to thr
(S360T) and a nonsense mutation, glu416 to ter (E416X; 608002.0003). The
S360T mutation was caused by a 1079G-C transversion.

.0003
NEPHRONOPHTHISIS 3
NPHP3, GLU461TER

See 608002.0002 and Olbrich et al. (2003). The E416X mutation was caused
by a 1381G-T transversion.

MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 7
RENAL-HEPATIC-PANCREATIC DYSPLASIA 1, INCLUDED
NPHP3, IVS19AS, 2-BP DEL

Bergmann et al. (2008) reported 2 female fetuses, born of consanguineous
Turkish parents, with enlarged renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia; one
of the fetuses also had Dandy-Walker cyst. The features were consistent
with Meckel syndrome-7 (MKS7; 267010). In both fetuses, Bergmann et al.
(2008) identified a homozygous deletion in the intron 19 splice acceptor
site of the NPHP3 gene (c.2694-1_2 del), resulting in premature protein
truncation. One fetus was terminated at 23 weeks' gestation and the
other died in the perinatal period. Both had multicystic dysplastic
kidneys and hepatic ductal plate malformation. One had aortic stenosis.

Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) reported 2 Norwegian sibs, born to remotely
consanguineous parents, with lethal renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia-1
(RHPD1; 208540) who were homozygous for an AG deletion in intron 19 of
the NPHP3 gene. The first child had intrauterine growth retardation,
Potter facies with hypertelorism, beak-like nose, short neck, and short
sternum, and died of respiratory insufficiency 1 day after birth. The
pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. The lungs and kidneys were
hypoplastic, and the kidneys contained multiple small cysts and were
dysplastic. The pancreas was enlarged, fibrotic, and showed irregular
ducts and atrophy of acini. There was portal fibrosis and paucity of
bile ducts in the liver. The brain was normal. The second pregnancy
resulted in elective termination at 16 weeks' gestation due to multiple
abnormalities. The fetus had dysmorphic features consistent with Potter
facies and flexion contractures of multiple joints. There was complete
situs inversus of the thoracic and abdominal organs. Microscopic studies
showed renal dysplasia, hepatic ductal plate malformation, and dysplasia
of the pancreas with dilated ductal structures with scarce lobular
differentiation. Although the brain was grossly normal, there was
evidence of polymicrogyria. Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) noted the
phenotypic similarities to the Turkish patients reported by Bergmann et
al. (2008).

.0005
MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 7
NPHP3, ARG577TER

In 2 African brothers with renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia, one of
whom died at age 49 days and the other in the perinatal period, Bergmann
et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 1729C-T transition in exon 11 of
the NPHP3 gene, resulting in an arg577-to-ter (R577X) substitution. One
infant was neurologically abnormal with hypertonia and was found to have
a cyst on the floor of the right ventricle as well as bilateral cysts in
the choroid plexus. The other had extremely enlarged fontanelles and a
hypoplastic calvarium. Variable features included atrial septal defect,
persistent ductus arteriosus, and atresia of the right ureter. Both had
enlarged multicystic dysplastic kidneys. The phenotype was consistent
with Meckel syndrome-7 (267010).

.0006
RENAL-HEPATIC-PANCREATIC DYSPLASIA 1
NPHP3, ARG973GLN

In 2 Swiss brothers with renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia-1 (208540),
Bergmann et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the NPHP3 gene: a 2918G-A transition in exon 20 resulting
in an arg973-to-gln (R973Q) substitution, and a 3340C-T transition in
exon 24 resulting in a gln1114-to-ter (Q1114X; 608002.0007)
substitution. One boy died in the perinatal period and the other was
alive at age 17 years with normal cognition. The surviving boy had
combined liver-kidney transplant at age 3 years. The patients had
previously been reported by Neuhaus et al. (1996).

RENAL-HEPATIC-PANCREATIC DYSPLASIA 1
NPHP3, IVS13AS, G-A, +5

In an 8-year-old Vietnamese girl with renal-hepatic-pancreatic
dysplasia-1 (208540), Bergmann et al. (2008) identified a homozygous
acceptor splice site mutation in the NPHP3 gene, IVS13+5G-A, resulting
in skipping of exon 13 and an out-of-frame transcript with premature
termination. She also had situs inversus totalis, postaxial polydactyly
of the left foot, and inguinal hernias. She underwent combined
liver-kidney transplant at age 4 years.

NEPHRONOPHTHISIS 3
NPHP3, ARG702TER

In 12 infants from 6 Old Order Amish families with lethal neonatal
nephronophthisis-3 (604387), Simpson et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 2104C-T transition in exon 15 of the NPHP3 gene, resulting in
an arg702-to-ter (R702X) substitution. The mutation was not present in
100 control chromosomes. All 12 unaffected parents descended from a
common ancestral couple who lived in the community during the 19th
century. Most of the pregnancies were associated with oligohydramnios.
Clinical features included cystic kidneys, low-set ears, and small lungs
with respiratory insufficiency. One infant was reported to have situs
inversus, and 2 had absent bladder. Simpson et al. (2009) noted that few
affected infants had complete medical evaluations due to the severe
nature of the disease, and no autopsy information was available. Thus,
additional extrarenal manifestations may have been present.

606501	TITLE *606501 MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED PROTEIN 12; MTMR12
;;PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-PHOSPHATE 3-PHOSPHATASE ADAPTOR SUBUNIT; 3PAP;;
KIAA1682
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3R1; 171833)-derived,
membrane-anchored phosphatidylinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), regulate diverse cellular processes. 3PAP
functions as an adaptor subunit in a complex with an active PtdIns(3)P
3-phosphatase.

CLONING

By screening for cDNAs with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding
3PAP, which they called KIAA1682. KIAA1682 encodes a deduced 775-amino
acid protein. RT-PCR analysis detected moderate expression of KIAA1682
in all tissues tested.

By biochemical purification and microsequence analysis of the rat brain
cytosolic 3Pap protein, followed by PCR with degenerate primers,
screening of a K562 cDNA library, and RT-PCR, Nandurkar et al. (2001)
obtained a cDNA encoding human 3PAP. Sequence analysis predicted that
the 3PAP protein has homology to myotubularin but, like SBF1 (603560),
lacks the HCX5R catalytic motif. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of 5.5- and 2.5-kb 3PAP transcripts that were prominent in
brain, heart, kidney, liver, placenta, and lung. Immunoblot analysis
showed expression of an 86-kD protein in various tissues and cell lines.
Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that platelet 3PAP, but not
recombinant 3PAP, possesses lipid 3-phosphatase activity. Nandurkar et
al. (2001) concluded that 3PAP is an adaptor subunit in a complex with
an active PtdIns(3)P 3-phosphatase.

MAPPING

Using a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the
KIAA1682 gene to both chromosomes 5 and 11. The International Radiation
Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the 3PAP gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP
RH26387).

611487	TITLE *611487 SYNAPTONEMAL COMPLEX CENTRAL ELEMENT PROTEIN 2; SYCE2
;;CENTRAL ELEMENT SYNAPTONEMAL COMPLEX 1; CESC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Completion of meiosis in mammals depends on the formation of the
synaptonemal complex, a tripartite structure that physically links
homologous chromosomes during prophase I. In a search for components of
the meiotic machinery, Costa et al. (2005) used expression profiling to
find genes that are transcribed in mouse testes between postpartum days
7 and 11 and that differed between normal animals and infertile Dazla
(601486) mutants, which do not form spermatozoa. They identified 2 such
genes, which they designated Syce1 and Cesc1 (SYCE2; 611487). Both genes
have orthologs in other mammals, including humans. The Syce2 gene
encodes a deduced 171-amino acid nonglobular protein with a series of
loops and helices, including predicted coiled-coil regions. Northern
blot analysis detected high expression of Syce2 in testis and lower
expression in a wide range of other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Costa et al. (2005) performed immunostaining with antibodies raised to
Syce1 and Syce2 and detected a signal only in the synaptonemal complex
of both male and female meiotic chromosomes. The localization pattern
was indistinguishable from that previously seen for SYCP1 (602162), a
known component of the SC. Additional studies showed that Syce1 and
Syce2 interact with each other and with Sycp1, and that Syce1 and Syce2
are recruited to the central element of the SC by Sycp1.

MAPPING

Scott (2007) mapped the SYCE2 gene to chromosome 19p13.13 based on an
alignment of the SYCE2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK097443) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

ANIMAL MODEL

Bolcun-Filas et al. (2007) created an Syce2 knockout mouse and showed
that the homologous meiotic chromosomes align normally and initiate
recombination but are not able to synapse correctly. Further, crossing
over was impaired so that gametes could not be produced in either male
or female animals.

609495	TITLE *609495 GAMETOGENETIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; GGNBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From a yeast 2-hybrid screen of Ggn1 (see 609966)-interacting proteins,
Zhou et al. (2005) identified mouse Ggnbp1, which encodes a deduced
370-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed
testis-specific expression. By RT-PCR of human testis RNA followed by
BLAST analysis, Zhou et al. (2005) identified a human homolog, encoding
2 products of 88 and 109 amino acids generated by alternative splicing.
By database searching, Zhou et al. (2005) identified a rat homolog but
found no homologs in C. elegans, Drosophila, Fugu, or zebrafish. Human
GGNBP1 showed homology to rodent Ggnbp1 only at the C-terminal end. Zhou
et al. (2005) found that human, mouse, and rat GGNBP1 contain part of a
domain of unknown function, DUF1055.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in situ hybridization of mouse testis tissue, Zhou et al. (2005)
found that Ggnbp1 is expressed specifically in germ cells from late
primary spermatocytes to early round spermatids. The highest expression
was observed in germ cells prior to meiosis. Transfection experiments
demonstrated localization in the plasma membrane and Golgi body.

MAPPING

The Ggnbp1 gene maps to mouse chromosome 17 (Zhou et al., 2005).

192321	TITLE *192321 VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL PEPTIDE RECEPTOR 1; VIPR1
;;VIP RECEPTOR, TYPE I; VIPR;;
PITUITARY ADENYLATE CYCLASE-ACTIVATING POLYPEPTIDE RECEPTOR, TYPE
II;;
PACAP RECEPTOR, TYPE II;;
HVR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320) has potent relaxing effects
on vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle, regulates water and ion flux
from lung and intestinal epithelia, promotes neuronal growth and
survival, and modulates immune functions. Distinct subsets of neural,
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune cells bear specific
high-affinity G protein-coupled receptors for VIP, such as VIPR1
(Sreedharan et al., 1995).

CLONING

Sreedharan et al. (1993) cloned a human intestinal VIP receptor gene;
the deduced amino acid sequence shares 84% identity with the rat lung
VIP receptor.

Couvineau et al. (1994) isolated 2 VIPR cDNA clones from a human jejunal
epithelial cell cDNA library. One encodes a VIP receptor consisting of
460 amino acids and having 7 putative transmembrane domains, as do other
G protein-coupled receptors. The other encodes a 495-amino acid VIP
receptor-related protein exhibiting 100% homology with the functional
VIP receptor over the 428 amino acids at the C-terminal region, but
containing a completely divergent 67-amino acid N-terminal domain. When
expressed in COS-7 cells, the second protein did not bind radioiodinated
VIP, although it was normally addressed at the plasma membrane as
assessed by immunofluorescence studies.

GENE STRUCTURE

The VIPR1 gene was found by Sreedharan et al. (1995) to span
approximately 22 kb and to be comprised of 13 exons (ranging from 42 to
1,400 bp) and 12 introns (ranging from 0.3 to 6.1 kb). Sreedharan et al.
(1995) also characterized the promoter and the 5-prime flanking region
of the gene.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Sreedharan et al. (1995) mapped the VIPR1 gene to chromosome
3p22 in a region associated with small-cell lung cancer. By
interspecific backcross analysis, Hashimoto et al. (1999) mapped the
mouse Vipr1 gene to the distal region of chromosome 9, which shows
homology of synteny with human chromosome 3p.

608439	TITLE *608439 TOUSLED-LIKE KINASE 2; TLK2
;;PROTEIN KINASE, UBIQUITOUS-ALPHA; PKU-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Tousled-like kinases, first described in Arabidopsis, are nuclear
serine/threonine kinases that are potentially involved in the regulation
of chromatin assembly.

CLONING

By screening an expression library for autophosphorylation activity,
followed by screening a testis cDNA library, Yamakawa et al. (1997)
cloned TLK2, which they called PKU-alpha. The deduced 717-amino acid
protein has a 5-domain structure, including an N-terminal nuclear
localization signal and a single catalytic domain near the C terminus.
TLK2 shares 86% sequence identity with TLK1 (608438) overall, and 94%
identity in the catalytic region. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.5-kb transcript expressed primarily in fetal kidney, liver, heart, and
skeletal muscle, and in placenta. Immunofluorescence analysis of
transfected COS-1 cells localized TLK2 to the nucleus. By PCR
amplification of sequences similar to Arabidopsis TSL, followed by
screening several cDNA libraries, Sillje et al. (1999) cloned TLK2. The
deduced 749-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 85.3
kD. By RNAse protection analysis of RNA isolated from various adult
mouse organs, they found that Tlk2 is expressed at a high level in
testis, and at lower levels in heart, brain, liver, and other organs.
Western blot analysis detected endogenous HeLa cell TLK1 and TLK2 that
migrated together at an apparent molecular mass of about 85 kD. Both
proteins were also localized to the nucleus and were excluded from
nucleoli.

GENE FUNCTION

Using myelin basic protein (MBP; 159430), casein (see 115450), and
histone H1 (see 142709) as model substrates, Sillje et al. (1999)
confirmed kinase activity in TLK2. MBP was readily phosphorylated, and
histone was poorly phosphorylated. TLK2 also autophosphorylated on both
serine and threonine, and phosphorylation was required for catalytic
activity. Activity was also dependent upon asp-590 within the catalytic
domain. The authors further found that both TLK1 and TLK2 displayed
maximal activity during S phase of the cell cycle. Whereas protein
levels were virtually constant throughout the cell cycle, both TLKs
appeared to be regulated by cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation.
Inhibition of DNA replication caused a rapid loss of TLK activity,
indicating that TLK function is tightly linked to ongoing DNA
replication. With use of several human cell lines, Groth et al. (2003)
determined that both TLK1 and TLK2 were novel targets of the DNA damage
checkpoint. Both TLKs were rapidly inactivated upon exposure to ionizing
radiation, and the inactivation was directly mediated by the S-phase DNA
damage checkpoint.

MAPPING

By FISH, Yamakawa et al. (1997) mapped the TLK2 gene to chromosome
17q23.

608388	TITLE *608388 EVOLUTIONARILY-CONSERVED SIGNALING INTERMEDIATE IN TOLL PATHWAY; ECSIT
;;SITPEC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ECSIT protein interacts with the TLR signaling adaptor TRAF6
(602355), localizes to mitochondria, and has a role in oxidative
phosphorylation complex I assembly (summary by West et al., 2011).

CLONING

Using mouse Traf6 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Kopp et al. (1999)
cloned 3 splice variants of mouse Ecsit from liver and pre-B-cell cDNA
libraries. The longest deduced protein contains 435 amino acids, and the
variants differ in their C termini. Northern blot analysis detected a
transcript of about 1.6 kb in all mouse tissues examined.

Vogel et al. (2007) stated that 10 ECSIT splice variants are predicted,
but only the 2 longest have been identified in experimental studies. The
longest, called variant 1, utilizes all 8 exons and encodes a deduced
431-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 50 kD.
Variant 2 lacks exon 6 and encodes a deduced 382-amino acid protein with
a calculated molecular mass of 33 kD. Western blot analysis of
fractionated human embryonic kidney cells detected a protein of about 50
kD in the cytoplasm/nuclear fraction and a protein of about 45 kD in the
mitochondrial fraction. The first 48 amino acids of ECSIT constitute a
mitochondrial targeting signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Kopp et al. (1999) determined that mouse Ecsit is an intermediate in the
activation of the Toll (see 603030)/Il1 (see 147760) pathway and
regulates Mekk1 (600982) processing for activation of Nfkb (see 164011).
Expression of wildtype Ecsit accelerated the processing of Mekk1, and a
dominant-negative fragment of Ecsit blocked Mekk1 processing and
activation of Nfkb.

Using 2-dimensional native PAGE analysis of mitochondria enriched from
HEK293 and HeLa cells, Vogel et al. (2007) found that the 45-kD
mitochondrial ECSIT protein, but not the 50-kD cytosolic protein, was a
component of higher molecular mass complexes of about 500, 600, and 850
kD. ECSIT copurified with the mitochondrial complex I assembly chaperone
NDUFAF1 (606934), and knockdown of ECSIT resulted in impaired complex I
assembly and disturbed mitochondrial function.

West et al. (2011) demonstrated that engagement of a subset of Toll-like
receptors (TLR1, 601194; TLR2, 603028; and TLR4, 603030) results in the
recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production. This response
involves translocation of a TLR signaling adaptor, TRAF6, to
mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT, which is implicated in
mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly. Interaction with TRAF6 leads
to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery,
resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS generation. ECSIT-
and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels of TLR-induced ROS
and are significantly impaired in their ability to kill intracellular
bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS levels by expressing
catalase (115500) in mitochondria results in defective bacterial
killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal activity. West et
al. (2011) concluded that their results revealed a novel pathway linking
innate immune signaling to mitochondria, implicated mROS as an important
component of antibacterial responses, and further established
mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vogel et al. (2007) stated that the ECSIT gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ECSIT
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH98319).

ANIMAL MODEL

Xiao et al. (2003) found that targeted disruption of Ecsit in mice led
to reduced cell proliferation, altered epiblast patterning, impaired
mesoderm formation, and lethality at embryonic day 7.5. The phenotype
mimicked that of Bmpr1a (601299) null mice. Biochemical analysis
demonstrated that Ecsit associated constitutively with Smad4 (600993)
and Smad1 (601595) in a Bmp-inducible manner. Together with Smad1 and
Smad4, Ecsit bound to the promoter of specific Bmp target genes.
Knockdown of Ecsit expression with short hairpin RNA inhibited both Bmp
and Toll signaling.

614176	TITLE *614176 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 28; ZFYVE28
;;LST2, C. ELEGANS, ORTHOLOG OF; LST2;;
KIAA1643
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ZFYVE28, which they designated
KIAA1643. The deduced protein contains 993 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA of
human tissues detected very high ZFYVE28 expression in whole adult
brain, followed by fetal brain, with much lower expression in all other
tissues examined. Within specific adult brain regions, highest
expression was detected in amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and
thalamus, followed by substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus.

By searching a human database for sequences similar to C. elegans Lst2,
Mosesson et al. (2009) identified ZFYVE28, which they called LST2. The
deduced 887-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal FYVE domain and 2
conserved regions, an N-terminal domain, called NDom, and a central
domain, called the CBox. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected high Lst2 expression in brain. LST2 was also detected
in human cell lines. The most prominent protein had an apparent
molecular mass of 130 to 140 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Mosesson et al. (2009) found that LST2 regulated internalization and
degradation of EGFR (131550), thereby terminating EGFR signaling. LST2
was monoubiquitinated on lys87 within the NDom domain, and
ubiquitination required the CBox. In the absence of ubiquitination, the
FYVE domain of LST2 bound the endosomal phospholipid
phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), and LST2 localized to early
endosomes with EGFR and promoted receptor degradation. Ubiquitination of
LST2 inhibited its PI3P-binding ability and released it from endosomes.
Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of mouse brain lysates showed LST2 also bound
Trim3 (605493), a coordinator of endosomal trafficking.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ZFYVE28
gene to chromosome 4. Mosesson et al. (2009) stated that the ZFYVE28
gene maps to chromosome 4p16.

142810	TITLE *142810 HISTIDYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; HARS
;;HRS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HARS catalyzes the covalent ligation of histidine to its cognate tRNA as
an early step in protein biosynthesis (O'Hanlon and Miller, 2002).

CLONING

O'Hanlon et al. (1995) noted that HARS and HARS2 (600783), which they
called HO3, are oriented in a head-to-head configuration and share a
bidirectional promoter. They reported that the deduced 509-amino acid
HARS protein shares 72% amino acid identity with HARS2. Both proteins
contain 3 motifs conserved among class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and
2 signature regions of histidyl-tRNA synthetases. However, HARS and
HARS2 have divergent N-terminal domains that are encoded by the first 2
exons of each gene. HARS has a calculated molecular mass of 57.4 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb HARS transcript that was highly
expressed in heart, brain, liver, and kidney.

Using 5-prime RACE with a human kidney cDNA library, O'Hanlon and Miller
(2002) identified several HARS transcripts that differed only in the
lengths of their 5-prime UTRs. O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) noted that
pufferfish and human HARS proteins share 84% amino acid homology,
suggesting a high degree of conservation.

GENE STRUCTURE

O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) determined that the HARS gene contains 13
exons and spans approximately 17.4 kb. The HARS and HARS2 genes share a
bidirectional promoter that lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. Both genes use
multiple transcriptional start sites. HARS also uses a second, more
distal promoter that overlaps the first exons of the HARS2 gene.

MAPPING

Carlock et al. (1985) used a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with
mutations in 3 genes, HARS, RPS14 (130620) and CHR (118840), in
interspecies cell hybridization experiments, to assign the HARS gene to
chromosome 5. Wasmuth and Carlock (1986) assigned the HARS gene to
chromosome 5 by use of human-Chinese hamster ovary cell hybrids.

By genomic sequence analysis, O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) mapped the HARS
and HARS2 genes to chromosome 5q31.3. HARS and HARS2 exhibit a
head-to-head orientation, with 344 bp separating their ORFs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type III mapping to chromosome 5q (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the
HARS gene (Y454S; 142810.0001) that was not found in dbSNP 129 or the
1000 Genomes Project. In addition, an Old Order Amish patient from an
unrelated deme in Ontario, Canada, had an identical phenotype and was
homozygous for the same mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIB
HARS, TYR454SER

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type IIIB (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity for a 1361A-C transversion in the HARS gene,
resulting in a tyr454-to-ser (Y454S) substitution in the interface
between the catalytic domain and the anticodon binding domain. A patient
with an identical phenotype from an unrelated Old Order Amish deme in
Ontario, Canada, was also homozygous for the Y454S mutation. The variant
was not found in dbSNP 129 or the 1000 Genomes Project; it was, however,
detected in 7 of 406 Old Order Amish alleles, for a population-specific
allele frequency of 1.72%. (Puffenberger (2012) stated that the correct
population-specific allele frequency data appear in Table 4;
corresponding data in the text are incorrect.)

.0002
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HARS, ARG137GLN (dbSNP rs191391414)

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to a peripheral neuropathy has not been confirmed.

In a 64-year-old man with a 15-year history of impaired sensation in the
lower extremities and electrophysiologic studies suggestive of an axonal
peripheral neuropathy, Vester et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
410G-A transition (dbSNP rs191391414) in the HARS gene, resulting in an
arg137-to-gln (R137Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
catalytic core of the enzyme. The patient was ascertained from a larger
cohort of 363 individuals with peripheral neuropathy. The R137Q variant
was also found in 3 of over 13,000 control chromosomes. One of the
control carriers had no evidence of neuropathy at age 57 years.
Generation of a yeast strain with deletion of the Hst1 gene (the
ortholog of HARS) showed that the R137Q variant could not complement the
Hst1 deletion, suggesting that it is a loss-of-function allele.
Expression of the R137Q variant specifically in GABA motor nerves of C.
elegans caused gross morphologic defects in commissural axons, with
failure to reach the dorsal nerve cord, axonal beading, defasciculation,
and breaks in the nerve cord. The animals with the variant also showed
locomotor defects. Vester et al. (2013) concluded that the HARS R137Q
variant may be a pathogenic allele that predisposes to the development
of peripheral neuropathy, similar to other ARS mutations (see, e.g.,
GARS, 600287), but noted that a causal link remains unclear.
