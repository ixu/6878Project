171900	TITLE *171900 PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE 1; PGM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphoglucomutases (PGM; EC 5.4.2.2) catalyze the transfer of phosphate
between the 1 and 6 positions of glucose. Isozymes of PGM are monomeric,
with molecular masses of about 60 kD, and are encoded by several genes,
including PGM1. In most cell types, PGM1 isozymes predominate,
representing about 90% of total PGM activity. One exception is red
cells, where PGM2 (172000) is a major isozyme (Putt et al., 1993).

CLONING

Hopkinson and Harris (1966) presented evidence for the existence of at
least 2 structural PGM loci, PGM1 and PGM2.

Whitehouse et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA encoding human PGM1. Eighteen
amino acid differences were found between human and rabbit PGM1.
Southern blot analysis indicated that PGM1 is conserved among a wide
variety of vertebrates ranging from primates to birds and amphibia. No
evidence for PGM1-related sequences was found either by Southern blot
analysis or by in situ hybridization. Thus, if the genes encoding human
PGM2 and PGM3 (172100) arose by duplication from the same ancestral gene
as PGM1, it seems likely that less than 65% sequence homology has been
preserved.

In addition to the ubiquitously expressed Pgm1 transcript, a fast
muscle-specific Pgm1 transcript, designated Pgm1fm, exists in rabbit. By
PCR using primers derived from the 5-prime end of rabbit Pgm1fm, Putt et
al. (1993) isolated human PGM1FM. Human PGM1 and PGM1FM contain
alternative first exons, and the deduced PGM1FM protein contains 18
additional N-terminal amino acids compared with PGM1. Human PGM1FM
appeared to be expressed at low levels in fast muscle only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Putt et al. (1993) determined that the PGM1 gene contains 12 exons,
including 2 alternative first exons, exons 1A and 1B, that are specific
to the ubiquitous PGM1 transcript and the fast muscle PGM1 transcript,
respectively. PGM1 spans more than 65 kb, with about 29 kb separating
exons 1A and 1B. The region encompassing exon 1A has features
characteristic of a housekeeping promoter, including high GC content,
high incidence of CpG dinucleotides, lack of TATA or CCAAT boxes, and 6
Sp1 (189906)-binding sites. In contrast, the region encompassing exon 1B
is not GC rich, has a low incidence of CpG dinucleotides, and lacks
Sp1-binding sites as well as TATA or CCAAT boxes, features consistent
with a nonhousekeeping promoter.

MAPPING

Parrington et al. (1968) found that the PGM1, PGM2, and PGM3 genes are
not closely linked. By cell hybridization, synteny of PGM1 and peptidase
C (PEPC; 170000) was demonstrated by Billardon et al. (1973). These loci
are on chromosome 1. Douglas et al. (1973) demonstrated that the PGM1
and 6PGD (PGD; 172200) genes are on the distal end of the short arm of
chromosome 1.

Assuming that each arm of chromosome 1 is 140 male cM in length, Cook et
al. (1974) concluded that, measured from the centromere, map positions
are as follows: PGD 1p124; Rh (see 111680) 1p109; PGM1 1p079; Fy
(110700) 1p010, PEPC 1q030. The Goss-Harris method of mapping by
radiation-induced gene segregation combines features of recombinational
study in families and synteny tests in hybrid cells. As applied to
chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2 (103020) and UMPK (CMPK1;
191710) are distal to PGM1 and that the order of the genes is
PGM1--UMPK--AK2/alpha-FUC (FUCA1; 612280)--ENO1 (172430) (Goss and
Harris, 1977). On the basis of a family segregating for elliptocytosis
(611804) and PGD, as well as the common polymorphisms Rh, PGM1, and
alpha-fucosidase, Cook et al. (1977) concluded that the map of 1p is, in
the male,
1pter--PGD--18%--El--2%--Rh--2%--alpha-FUC--25%--PGM1--centromere. In
the female the intervals were estimated to be 22%, 4%, 2%, and 37%,
respectively.

The anonymous fragment D1S2 was found to be 7 cM from PGM1 by linkage
analysis (Kidd et al., 1988). DNA from somatic cell hybrids containing
different portions of chromosome 1 was used for Southern blot analysis,
placing D1S2 proximal to 1p32 and distal to PGM1. Kidd et al. (1990)
suggested that the somatic cell localization of PGM1 to 1p22.1 may be in
error, since linkage studies showed it to be 11.7 cM distal to ACADM
(607008), which has been assigned to 1p31 by in situ hybridization.

Whitehouse et al. (1992) assigned the PGM1 gene to chromosome 1p31 by in
situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By starch gel electrophoresis, Spencer et al. (1964) demonstrated
polymorphism of phosphoglucomutase. Hopkinson and Harris (1966)
presented evidence suggesting that PGM1 is responsible for
electrophoretically slow-moving components, and at least 5 alleles were
identified. PGM2 determines the electrophoretically fast-moving
components, and at least 3 alleles may exist at this locus.

By starch gel electrophoresis and by direct determination of activity,
Ferrell et al. (1984) detected a deficiency allele at the PGM1 locus. In
neither homozygous nor heterozygous state did the null allele have other
phenotypic consequences.

Dykes et al. (1985) reported on a nomenclature workshop on PGM1
polymorphisms held in 1983. A total of 30 rare variants were identified
and it was recommended that the 4 common alleles be designated as
follows: PGM1*1A, PGM1*1B, PGM1*2A, and PGM1*2B.

In the course of paternity testing, Herbich et al. (1985) found an
apparent maternal exclusion by the PGM1 enzyme system (mother PGM1 type
1, child PGM1 type 2) and by the Duffy blood group system (mother
Fy(a-b+), child Fy(a+b-)). The father was not available for testing. The
possibility that the child had been mistakenly identified after birth
could be eliminated. The karyotype of the child showed a 'new fragile
site' at 1p31, which contains the PGM1 and Duffy loci.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Takahashi et al. (1982) advanced a phylogeny that attributed 8 alleles
of the PGM1 locus to 3 independent mutations in a primal allele,
followed by 4 intragenic recombination events involving these mutants.
Using the cDNA probes provided by Whitehouse et al. (1992) and Takahashi
and Neel (1993), March et al. (1993) confirmed the earlier hypothesis
based on protein studies by electrophoresis. The findings were
interpreted as strongly supporting the view that only 2 point mutations
were involved in the generation of the 4 common alleles and that 1
allele must have arisen by homologous intragenic recombination between
these mutation sites.

PGM1 is a highly polymorphic protein. Three mutations and 4 intragenic
recombination events between the 3 mutation sites generate 8 protein
variants, including the 4 universally common alleles, 1+, 1-, 2+, and
2-, and 4 others that are polymorphic in some Oriental populations, 3+,
3-, 7+, and 7-. The mutations 3/7, 2/1, and +/- are in exons 1A, 4, and
8, and are 40 and 18 kb apart, respectively. Using 12 polymorphic
markers, including 2/1 and +/-, Yip et al. (1999) obtained direct
evidence for a high rate of intragenic recombination across this 58-kb
region. From segregation analysis of PGM1 haplotypes in CEPH families,
the recombination frequency was estimated to be 1.7%. Yip et al. (1999)
also used a population genetics approach to map the patterns of linkage
disequilibrium across the PGM1 gene in 3 diverse population samples
(Caucasian, Chinese, and Vietnamese). By this approach they could
compare indirect estimates of intragenic recombination with the meiotic
data from family studies. Comprehensive pairwise allelic association
analysis of the markers indicated the presence of 2 recombination
'hotspots': one between exons 1A and 4 and the other in the region of
exon 7. These locations were consistent with the meiotic data and with
the original hypothesis of intragenic recombination based on PGM1
isozyme analysis.

Rana et al. (2004) genotyped 264 Caucasian, 222 Chinese, and 187
Vietnamese individuals at 18 SNPs within exons 1A to 4 of the PGM1 gene
and constructed haplotypes. Allelic association and haplotype analysis
revealed 3 hotspots and 3 haplotype blocks with identical spatial
arrangement in all populations studied. The pattern of association
within PGM1 represented a region decomposed into small blocks of linkage
disequilibrium, where increased recombination activity has disrupted the
ancestral chromosome. The authors observed overlap between meiotic
crossovers, regions of low linkage disequilibrium, and sequence motifs.

- Glycogen Storage Disease XIV

In a man with exercise intolerance and episodic rhabdomyolysis resulting
from PGM1 deficiency (GSD14; 612934), Stojkovic et al. (2009) identified
compound heterozygous mutations in the PGM1 gene (171900.0001 and
171900.0002). Each unaffected parent carried 1 of the mutations.

- Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type It

In 2 unrelated patients with congenital disorder of glycosylation type
1t (CDG1T; 614921), Timal et al. (2012) identified 2 different
homozygous mutations in the PGM1 gene (171900.0003 and 171900.0004,
respectively). The mutations were identified by exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Transferrin isoelectric focusing in both
patients showed abnormal N-glycosylation. In addition to the loss of
complete N-glycans, there were minor bands of monosialo- and
trisialotransferrin, suggesting the presence of incomplete glycans.
Thus, the pattern could best be described as CDGI/II.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XIV
PGM1, THR115ALA

In a man with glycogen storage disease XIV (612934), Stojkovic et al.
(2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PGM1
gene: a 343A-G transition resulting in a thr115-to-ala (T115A)
substitution, and a G-to-C transversion in intron 7 resulting in a
splice site mutation (IVS7-1G-C; 171900.0002). Each mutation was
inherited from an unaffected parent and was not identified in 65 control
individuals. The patient had exercise intolerance and episodes of
rhabdomyolysis. PGM1 activity was 1% of control values.

CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE It
PGM1, GLY121ARG

In a boy of Colombian origin with congenital disorder of glycosylation
type It (CDG1T; 614921), Timal et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
415G-C transversion in the PGM1 gene, resulting in a gly121-to-arg
(G121R) substitution at a highly conserved residue. Cosegregation of the
mutation in the family could not be determined because the child was
adopted. The mutation was identified by exome sequencing and confirmed
by Sanger sequencing. The patient had dilated cardiomyopathy, cerebral
venous thrombosis, and elevated liver enzymes, and died at age 8 years.
Studies in patient fibroblasts showed 7% residual enzyme activity.

.0004
CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE It
PGM1, ARG503TER

In a 16-year-old girl with CDG1T (614921), Timal et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 1507C-T transition in the PGM1 gene, resulting
in an arg503-to-ter (R503X) substitution and a truncated protein lacking
the last 60 amino acids. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation. The mutation was identified by exome sequencing and confirmed
by Sanger sequencing. The patient had Pierre Robin sequence with cleft
palate, chronic hepatitis, fatigue and dyspnea, and dilated
cardiomyopathy. Laboratory studies showed elevated liver enzymes and
increased serum creatine kinase. Studies in patient fibroblasts showed
8% residual enzyme activity.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are nuclear receptors that mediate gene
regulation by thyroid hormone (TH, or T3). TRs form monomers,
homodimers, or heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs; see 180245)
at target DNA binding sites called TH-responsive elements (TREs). Two
different genes, THRA and THRB (190160), encode TRs, and both genes
produce multiple TR isoforms through alternative splicing (summary by
Nagaya et al., 1996).

CLONING

Thompson et al. (1987) isolated a cDNA derived from rat brain messenger
RNA on the basis of homology to the human thyroid receptor gene.
Expression of this cDNA produced a high-affinity binding protein for
thyroid hormone. Messenger RNA from this gene was expressed in
tissue-specific fashion, with highest levels in the central nervous
system and no expression in liver.

Nakai et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA encoding a specific form of thyroid
hormone receptor expressed in human liver, kidney, placenta, and brain.
Identical clones were found in human placenta. The cDNA encodes a
protein of 490 amino acids with a molecular mass of 54.8 kD. Designated
thyroid hormone receptor type alpha-2 (THRA2), this protein was
represented by mRNAs of different sizes in liver and kidney, possibly
representing tissue-specific processing of the primary transcript. Nakai
et al. (1988) suggested that the thyroid hormone receptor isolated from
a testis library by Benbrook and Pfahl (1987) may be identical to THRA2.

Sakurai et al. (1989) used Northern blot analysis to study the
distribution and abundance of mRNAs for the 3 thyroid hormone receptors,
beta, alpha-1, and alpha-2. The 3 mRNAs were expressed in all tissues
examined, and the relative amounts of the 3 were roughly parallel. None
of the 3 mRNAs was abundant in liver, the major thyroid
hormone-responsive organ, suggesting that another thyroid hormone
receptor may be present in liver.

Miyajima et al. (1989) reported that the human EAR7 generates 2
alternatively spliced forms, EAR71 and EAR72. The EAR71 protein is the
human counterpart of the chicken c-erbA protein.

Koenig et al. (1989) found that alternative splicing of the rat
Erba-alpha gene results in 2 proteins, Erba-alpha-1 and Erba-alpha-2,
that differ at their C-terminal ends.

Laudet et al. (1991) reported that a 5-kb THRA1 mRNA encodes a predicted
410-amino acid protein, and that a 2.7-kb THRA2 mRNA encodes a 490-amino
acid protein. The proteins differ at their C-terminal ends. Nagaya et
al. (1996) stated that a third isoform, THRA3, is derived by alternative
splicing. The proximal 39 amino acids of the THRA2-specific sequence are
deleted in THRA3.

Maternal thyroid hormone is transferred to the fetus early in pregnancy
and is postulated to regulate brain development. Iskaros et al. (2000)
investigated the ontogeny of TR isoforms and related splice variants in
9 first-trimester fetal brains by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis.
Expression of the TR-beta-1, TR-alpha-1, and TR-alpha-2 isoforms was
detected from 8.1 weeks' gestation. An additional truncated species was
detected with the TR-alpha-2 primer set, consistent with the TR-alpha-3
splice variant described in rat. All TR-alpha-derived transcripts were
coordinately expressed and increased approximately 8-fold between 8.1
and 13.9 weeks' gestation. A more complex ontogenic pattern was observed
for TR-beta-1, suggestive of a nadir between 8.4 and 12.0 weeks'
gestation. The authors concluded that these findings point to an
important role for the TR-alpha-1 isoform in mediating maternal thyroid
hormone action during first-trimester fetal brain development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Laudet et al. (1991) reported that the THRA gene contains 10 exons
spanning 27 kb of DNA. The last 2 exons of the gene are alternatively
spliced.

Miyajima et al. (1989) reported studies on the structure and function of
the EAR1 (602408) and EAR7 genes, both located on chromosome 17q21. They
determined that an exon in the EAR7 coding sequence overlaps an exon of
EAR1, and that the 2 genes are transcribed from opposite DNA strands.

MAPPING

Dayton et al. (1984) assigned the ERBA oncogene to chromosome 17, and
Spurr et al. (1984) confirmed this assignment. Both Dayton et al. (1984)
and Spurr et al. (1984) showed that the ERBA locus remains on chromosome
17 in the t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL;
612376). The thymidine kinase (188300) locus is probably translocated to
chromosome 15; study of leukemia with t(17;21) and apparently identical
breakpoint showed that TK was on 21q+.

Jhanwar et al. (1985) performed in situ hybridization of a cloned DNA
probe of ERBA to meiotic pachytene spreads obtained from uncultured
spermatocytes. They concluded that ERBA is situated at chromosome
17q21.33-17q22, in the same region as the break that generates the
t(15;17) seen in APL. Because most of the grains were seen in 17q22,
they suggested that ERBA is probably in the proximal region of 17q22 or
at the junction between 17q22 and 17q21.33.

By in situ hybridization, Le Beau et al. (1985) placed ERBA at
chromosome 17q11-q12 and demonstrated that it remains on chromosome 17
in APL, whereas TP53 (191170), at chromosome 17q21-q22, is translocated
to chromosome 15.

Ferro and San Roman (1981) discovered a constitutional t(15;17)
translocation apparently identical to that of APL. Molecular genetic
studies showed, however, that they are different: ERBA moves to
chromosome 15 in the constitutional translocation. Mitelman et al.
(1986) performed high resolution chromosome analysis on bone marrow
cells from 4 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia associated with
t(15;17) and in lymphocytes from 2 unrelated phenotypically normal
persons with an apparently identical constitutional translocation. In
all 6 cases the breakpoints were localized to subbands 15q22.3 and
17q11.2 in prophase-prometaphase chromosomes. Thus, ERBA must be at
17q11.2 just proximal to the breakpoint in the APL translocation and
just distal to it in the constitutional translocation.

By family linkage studies, Anderson et al. (1993) placed the THRA1 gene
on the genetic map of 17q in relation to other genes and DNA markers.

GENE FUNCTION

Debuire et al. (1984) found that ERBA, which potentiates ERBB (131550),
has an amino acid sequence different from that of other known oncogene
products and related to those of the carbonic anhydrases. ERBA
potentiates ERBB by blocking differentiation of erythroblasts at an
immature stage. Carbonic anhydrases participate in the transport of
carbon dioxide in erythrocytes. Sap et al. (1986) and Weinberger et al.
(1986) showed that the ERBA protein is a high-affinity receptor for
thyroid hormone. The cDNA sequence indicates a relationship to
steroid-hormone receptors, and binding studies indicate that it is a
receptor for thyroid hormones. It is located in the nucleus, where it
binds to DNA and activates transcription.

Koenig et al. (1989) showed that the rat Erba-alpha-1 isoform bound T3,
whereas the Erba-alpha-2 isoform did not. Erba-alpha-2 antagonized T3
binding and responsiveness by Erba-alpha-1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Nongoitrous Hypothyroidism 6

In a 6-year-old girl with congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism (CHNG6;
614450), Bochukova et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing and
identified a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in the THRA gene
(E403X; 190120.0001) that generates a mutant protein that inhibits
wildtype receptor action in a dominant-negative manner.

In a father and daughter with congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism, van
Mullem et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in
the THRA gene (190120.0002).

- Nonfunctioning Pituitary Adenomas, Somatic Mutations

McCabe et al. (1999) hypothesized that aberrant THRA expression in
nonfunctioning pituitary tumors may reflect mutations in the receptor
coding and regulatory sequences. They screened THRA mRNA and THRB
response elements and ligand-binding domains for sequence anomalies.
Screening THRA mRNA from 23 tumors by RNase mismatch and sequencing
candidate fragments identified 1 silent and 3 missense mutations, 2 in
the common THRA region (S45I and K370N) and 1 that was specific for the
alpha-2 isoform (S377L). No THRB response element differences were
detected in 14 nonfunctioning tumors, and no THRB ligand-binding domain
differences were detected in 23 nonfunctioning tumors. The authors
suggested that the novel thyroid receptor mutations may be of functional
significance in terms of thyroid receptor action, and that further
definition of their functional properties may provide insight into the
role of thyroid receptors in growth control in pituitary cells.

- Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, Somatic Mutations

Puzianowska-Kuznicka et al. (2002) tested the hypothesis that the
functions of TRs could be impaired in cancer tissues by aberrant
expression and/or somatic mutations. As a model system, they selected
human thyroid papillary cancer. They found that the mean expression
levels of THRB mRNA and THRA mRNA were significantly lower, whereas the
protein levels of THRB1 and THRA1 were higher in cancer tissues than in
healthy thyroid. Sequencing of THRB1 and THRA1 cDNAs, cloned from 16
papillary cancers, revealed that mutations affected receptor amino acid
sequences in 93.75% and 62.5% of cases, respectively. In contrast, no
mutations were found in healthy thyroid controls, and only 11.11% and
22.22% of thyroid adenomas had such THRB1 or THRA1 mutations,
respectively. The majority of the mutated TRs lost their transactivation
function and exhibited dominant-negative activity. The authors concluded
that these findings suggest a possible role for mutated thyroid hormone
receptors in the tumorigenesis of human papillary thyroid carcinoma.

ANIMAL MODEL

To evaluate the respective contributions of THRA and THRB in the
regulation of CYP7A (118455), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis
of bile acids, Gullberg et al. (2000) studied the responses to 2%
dietary cholesterol and T3 in THRA and THRB knockout mice under hypo-
and hyperthyroid conditions. Their experiments showed that the normal
stimulation in CYP7A activity and mRNA level by T3 is lost in THRB -/-,
but not in THRA -/-, mice, identifying THRB as the mediator of T3 action
on CYP7A and, consequently, as a major regulator of cholesterol
metabolism in vivo. Somewhat unexpectedly, T3-deficient THRB -/- mice
showed an augmented CYP7A response after challenge with dietary
cholesterol, and these animals did not develop hypercholesterolemia to
the extent that wildtype controls did. The authors concluded that the
latter results lend strong support to the concept that THRs may exert
regulatory effects in vivo independent of T3.

Mutations in the THRB gene result in resistance to thyroid hormone. To
address the question of whether mutations in the THRA gene can lead to a
similar disease, Kaneshige et al. (2001) prepared mutant mice by
targeting the same THRB mutation found in kindred PV, a 1-bp insertion
in the THRB gene (190160.0011), into the Thra1 gene by homologous
recombination. The PV mutation was derived from a patient with severe
resistance to thyroid hormone who had a frameshift of the C-terminal 14
amino acids of THRB1. They compared mice heterozygous for the Thr-alpha
mutation with mice heterozygous for the Thr-beta mutation. Heterozygous
Thr-alpha-1 mutant mice were viable, indicating that the mutation is not
an embryonic lethal. In drastic contrast to the heterozygous beta mice,
which did not exhibit a growth abnormality, the heterozygous alpha mice
were dwarfs. These dwarfs exhibited increased mortality and reduced
fertility. In contrast to the heterozygous beta mice, which had a
hyperactive thyroid, the heterozygous alpha mice exhibited mild thyroid
failure. The in vivo patterns of abnormal regulation of T3 target genes
in heterozygous alpha mice were different from those of heterozygous
beta mice. The distinct phenotypes exhibited by the heterozygous
Thr-alpha-1 and Thr-beta mice indicated that the in vivo functions of
thyroid hormone receptor mutants are isoform-dependent. The heterozygous
alpha mice may be useful as a tool to uncover human diseases associated
with mutations in the THRA gene, and, furthermore, to understand the
molecular mechanisms by which thyroid hormone receptor isoforms exert
their biologic activities.

Ng et al. (2001) determined that a targeted mutation in the THRA gene
suppresses deafness and thyroid hyperactivity in transgenic Thrb-null
mice. The THRA splice variant TR-alpha-1 receptor is nonessential for
hearing, and the shorter TR-alpha-2 splice variant has unknown function
but neither binds thyroid hormone nor transactivates. The targeted
mutation deletes TR-alpha-2 and concomitantly causes overexpression of
TR-alpha-1 as a consequence of the exon structure of the gene. The
Thra-null mice had normal auditory thresholds, suggesting that
TR-alpha-2 is dispensable for hearing, and have only marginally reduced
thyroid activity. However, a potent function for the mutated allele was
revealed upon its introduction into Thrb-null mice, where it suppressed
the auditory and thyroid phenotypes caused by loss of THRB. The authors
proposed a modifying function for a THRA allele and suggested that
increased expression of TR-alpha-1 may substitute for the absence of
THRB.

HISTORY

Jansson et al. (1983) demonstrated that both human and mouse DNA have 2
distantly related classes of ERBA genes and that in the human genome
multiple copies of one of the classes exist.

Thompson et al. (1987) suggested that there may be as many as 5
different but related loci encoding thyroid hormone receptors. Many of
the clinical and physiologic studies suggested the existence of multiple
receptors. For example, patients had been identified with familial
thyroid hormone resistance in which peripheral response to thyroid
hormones is lost or diminished while neuronal functions are maintained
(Menezes-Ferreira et al., 1984). Thyroidologists recognize a form of
cretinism in which the nervous system is severely affected and another
form in which the peripheral functions of thyroid hormone are more
dramatically affected.

The identification of the several types of thyroid hormone receptor may
explain the normal variation in thyroid hormone responsiveness of
various organs and the selective tissue abnormalities found in the
thyroid hormone resistance syndromes. See, for example, the sibship
reported by Refetoff et al. (1972), in which several members who were
resistant to thyroid hormone action had retarded growth, congenital
deafness, and abnormal bones, but had normal intellect and sexual
maturation, as well as augmented cardiovascular activity. In this
family, Bernal et al. (1978) demonstrated abnormal T3 nuclear receptors
in blood cells, and Ichikawa et al. (1987) demonstrated the same in
fibroblasts. The availability of cDNAs encoding the various thyroid
hormone receptors was considered useful in determining the underlying
genetic defect in this family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOTHYROIDISM, CONGENITAL, NONGOITROUS 6
THRA, GLU403TER

In a 6-year-old girl of white European origin with congenital
nongoitrous hypothyroidism (CHNG6; 614450), Bochukova et al. (2012)
performed whole-exome sequencing and identified a de novo heterozygous
1207G-T transversion in the THRA gene, resulting in a glu403-to-ter
(E403X) substitution, predicted to cause premature termination with loss
of the C-terminal alpha-helix. The mutation was not found in published
normal genomes and exomes or in 200 ethnically matched control alleles.
Functional analysis demonstrated that the mutant receptor did not
activate a thyroid hormone-responsive reporter gene and mediated
substantial repression of basal promoter activity, consistent with
negligible binding of radiolabeled triiodothyronine to mutant TR-alpha.
Coexpression studies showed that the E403X receptor strongly inhibited
transcriptional activity by wildtype TR-alpha in a dominant-negative
manner. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated markedly
reduced basal and triiodothyronine-induced expression of the thyroid
hormone-responsive target gene KLF9 (602902) compared to wildtype.
Two-hybrid interaction assays revealed strong recruitment of
corepressors by E403X mutant TR-alpha, with failure of their
hormone-dependent dissociation, and minimal triiodothyronine-dependent
association with coactivator SRC1 (602691).

HYPOTHYROIDISM, CONGENITAL, NONGOITROUS 6
THRA, 1-BP INS, 1190T

In a father and daughter with congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism
(CHNG6; 614450), van Mullem et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for
a 1-bp insertion (1190insT) in the THRA gene, causing a frameshift
predicted to result in premature termination (F397fs406X). The mutation
was not found in the unaffected mother, in 300 Caucasian controls, or in
public databases. Transfection studies showed that the mutant receptor
does not respond to stimulation by T3, and also exerts a strong
dominant-negative effect on wildtype THRA.

611999	TITLE *611999 RAB11 FAMILY-INTERACTING PROTEIN 4; RAB11FIP4
;;KIAA1821
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the large Rab GTPase family (see RAB1A; 179508) have
regulatory roles in the formation, targeting, and fusion of
intracellular transport vesicles. RAB11FIP4 is one of many proteins that
interact with and regulate Rab GTPases (Hales et al., 2001).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned a partial RAB11FIP4 cDNA, which
they designated KIAA1821. RT-PCR ELISA detected strong expression in
adult brain, moderate expression in fetal brain, kidney and pancreas,
with strong to moderate expression in specific adult brain regions
examined.

By database analysis using mouse Rab11fip4, Wallace et al. (2002)
identified RAB11FIP4. The deduced 637-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal EF-hand domain, a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, ERM motif,
and Rab11-binding domain. RAB11FIP4 shares 92% homology with its mouse
ortholog. Immunofluorescence studies colocalized RAB11FIP4 with RAB11A
(605570) to the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) and to endosomal
membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and Far Western analysis Wallace et al. (2002)
demonstrated that RAB11FIP4 interacted specifically with active RAB11
(see RAB11A; 605570), demonstrating no interaction with an S25N-mutant
RAB11 or with a constitutively active RAB11 mutant. RAB11FIP4 showed no
interaction with other RAB family members. RAB11FIP4 formed homodimers
and also bound RAB11FIP2 (608599), RAB11FIP3 (608738), and RIP11
(RAB11FIP5; 605536), but did not bind RAB11FIP1 (608737). Using the
RAB11FIP4 C-terminal region, Wallace et al. (2002) showed that RAB11FIP4
did not inhibit transferrin (190000) recycling.

Fielding et al. (2005) used immunofluorescence studies to colocalize
RAB11FIP4 and ARF6 (600464) to the furrow and midbody during
cytokinesis, and they demonstrated that this RAB11FIP4 localization was
ARF6-dependent. They suggested that RAB11FIP4 plays a role in vesicle
docking at the midbody. In vitro binding analysis showed the
nucleotide-dependent interaction of RAB11FIP4 with ARF6 GTPase with
weaker affinity for RAB11 and ARF5 (103188). RAB11FIP4
coimmunoprecipitated with exocyst complex protein Exo70p (EXOC7;
608163), RAB11FIP3, and RAB11. They concluded that RAB11FIP4 mediates
vesicle docking during cytokinesis.

;;O-LINKED N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINASE; OGA;;
O-GlcNAcase;;
NUCLEAR CYTOPLASMIC O-GlcNAcase AND ACETYLTRANSFERASE; NCOAT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The dynamic modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins by O-linked
N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) addition and removal on serine and
threonine residues is catalyzed by OGT (300255), which adds O-GlcNAc,
and MGEA5, a glycosidase that removes O-GlcNAc modifications (Gao et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening a meningioma expression library with autologous serum,
Heckel et al. (1998) identified 4 cDNA clones representing a novel gene,
which they designated meningioma-expressed antigen-5, with striking
homology to C. elegans hyaluronidase. MGEA5 was noted to have
hyaluronidase activity, but was otherwise not characterized.

By sequencing randomly selected cDNAs corresponding to relatively long
transcripts from human brain, Ishikawa et al. (1998) isolated an MGEA5
cDNA, which they designated KIAA0679, encoding a deduced 767-amino acid
protein. RT-PCR detected high MGEA5 expression in all tissues examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to bovine O-GlcNAcase,
followed by 5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA library, Gao et al. (2001)
cloned human MGEA5, or O-GlcNAcase. The deduced 916-amino acid protein
has an N-terminal domain of about 400 amino acids and a C-terminal
domain of about 350 amino acids that are highly conserved in vertebrate
and invertebrate homologs. The central region of about 150 amino acids
is highly variable. Northern blot analysis detected O-GlcNAcase in all
human tissues examined, with highest expression in brain, followed by
placenta and pancreas, and lowest expression in lung and liver.

Comtesse et al. (2001) identified a splice variant of MGEA5, which they
called MGEA5s, that includes part of intron 10 and has an alternative
stop codon and alternative polyadenylation signal. The deduced 677-amino
acid protein lacks the C-terminal acetyltransferase domain. Both MGEA5
and MGEA5s contain several possible phosphorylation sites,
N-glycosylation sites, and O-glycosylation sites. Western blot analysis
of a fractionated human glioblastoma cell line detected MGEA5 at an
apparent molecular mass of 130 kD in the cytoplasmic fraction, and
MGEA5s at an apparent molecular mass of 75 kD in the nuclear fraction. A
fraction containing membrane and cytoskeletal components showed the
130-kD protein. Toleman et al. (2004) identified a variant of rat Mgea5,
which they called Ncoat, that encodes a protein with the
acetyltransferase domain, but lacking the O-GlcNAcase domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao et al. (2001) demonstrated that COS-7 cells overexpressing human
O-GlcNAcase showed elevated O-GlcNAcase activity. Recombinant human
O-GlcNAcase displayed properties distinct from lysosomal
beta-hexosaminidase (see HEXA; 606869), with distinct substrate
preference and inhibitor sensitivity. O-GlcNAcase had a pH optimum of
5.7 to 7.0 and retained significant activity up to pH 8.0. It showed
strict substrate specificity for beta-linked GlcNAc, and it cleaved
GlcNAc attached to a test peptide.

Toleman et al. (2004) demonstrated that rodent Ncoat, when expressed in
a mammalian system but not in bacteria, possessed acetyltransferase
activity for a synthetic histone substrate, free core histones, and
oligonucleosomal substrates. Deletion analysis indicated that the
C-terminal third of Ncoat had histone acetyltransferase activity.
Toleman et al., 2004 suggested that NCOAT may play a dual role in gene
expression by removing O-GlcNAc modification from activators, while
adding acetyl groups to histones.

GENE STRUCTURE

Comtesse et al. (2001) determined that the MGEA5 gene contains 16 exons
and spans over 34 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the MGEA5
gene to chromosome 10. By somatic cell hybridization and FISH, Heckel et
al. (1998) mapped the gene to 10q24.1-q24.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forsythe et al. (2006) created a strain of C. elegans with knockout of
Oga1, the nematode homolog of Mgea5. Oga1 knockout altered serine- and
threonine-phosphoprotein profiles and increased GSK3B (605004) levels.
Mutant worms showed elevated stores of glycogen and trehalose and
decreased lipid storage.

;;p40.5;;
PROTEASE 26S, SUBUNIT 11; S11
DESCRIPTION Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a 26S ATP-dependent protease. The
protease is composed of a 20S catalytic proteasome and PA700, a 700-kD
regulatory complex (see PSMC1; 602706).

Hori et al. (1998) determined the partial protein sequences of bovine
p28 (PSMD10; 603480) and p40.5, 2 components of PA700. By searching a
sequence database, they identified cDNAs encoding the human p28 and
p40.5 homologs. The predicted human p40.5 protein contains 376 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of 43 kD. Using computerized homology
searches, Hori et al. (1998) identified Nas7, an S. cerevisiae gene
encoding a protein with 31% identity to p40.5. They disrupted the Nas7
gene and found that Nas7-deficient yeast cells were sensitive to heat
stress. Northern blot analysis revealed that p40.5 was expressed as a
1.3-kb mRNA in all human tissues tested.

By sequencing peptides obtained from purified 26S proteasome subunits,
followed by database analysis and PCR of human myeloblast cell line RNA,
Hoffman et al. (1999) cloned the PSMD13 gene, which they called subunit
11 (S11). The deduced 376-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 42.9 kD, and it shares 97% identity with mouse S11. Western blot
analysis detected S11 at about 43 kD.

By Far Western blot analysis, Hoffman et al. (1999) determined that S11
bound the 26S proteasome and the 19S regulatory complex, but not the 20S
proteasome.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSMD13
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-T99644).

;;TBP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TBPIP;;
GT198;;
HOP2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; HOP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMC3IP gene encodes a nuclear, tissue-specific protein with
multiple functions, including a role in meiotic recombination and as a
coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear
hormone receptors (summary by Zangen et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing putative genes centromeric to the BRCA1 gene (113705) on
chromosome 17, followed by screening a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Rommens et al. (1995) cloned GT198. The deduced protein
contains 203 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with abundant
expression in testis, colon, a breast cancer cell line, and a lymphoma.

Tanaka et al. (1997) cloned Gt198, which they called Tbpip, from a mouse
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein has several
putative phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected Tbpip expression in CD4
(186940)-positive T cells and in macrophages. In situ hybridization
found Tbpip mRNA colocalized with Tbp1 (186852) in seminiferous tubules
of adult mouse testis. Western blot analysis detected Tbpip at an
apparent molecular mass of 24 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
testis detected Tbpip in nuclei of primary and secondary spermatocytes.

By PCR using primers designed from mouse Tbpip, Ijichi et al. (2000)
cloned full-length human TBPIP from breast cancer cell line mRNA and a
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein contains an
acidic region near the C terminus and several putative phosphorylation
sites. Mouse and human TBPIP share 88% amino acid homology.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rommens et al. (1995) mapped the TBPIP
gene to chromosome 17q21. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ijichi et al.
(2000) mapped the TBPIP gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is
essential for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in infected cells.
TBP1 is a cellular protein that suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation
of HIV replication. Tanaka et al. (1997) found that mouse Tbpip
synergistically cooperated with Tbp1 to suppress Tat-mediated
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.

Ijichi et al. (2000) showed that human TBPIP interacted directly with
TBP1 and enhanced TBP1-mediated inhibition of HIV Tat-mediated
transactivation.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable
heterodimers. The HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1 (602721)- and RAD51
(179617)-mediated DNA strand exchange, and preferentially bound to a
3-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate.
Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure
proper pairing between homologous chromosomes by stimulating strand
exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse recombinant
Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and that Mnd1 was
the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation. Pezza et al. (2007) showed
that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated Dmc1 to promote synaptic
complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic alignment was a
consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules
through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree with
hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis mapping to chromosome 17 (ODG3;
614324), Zangen et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PSMC3IP gene (608665.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. In cell lines, the glu201del
mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petukhova et al. (2003) found that Hop2 knockout mice showed no gross
anomalies in somatic tissues but developed a profound deficiency in
gametogenesis. Hop2 -/- spermatocytes arrested at the stage of
pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements were fully
developed, but synapsis was limited. While meiotic double-stranded
breaks were formed and processed in Hop2 -/- mice, they failed to be
repaired.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OVARIAN DYSGENESIS 3
PSMC3IP, 3-BP DEL, 600GAG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree
with hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG3; 614324), Zangen et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in the
acceptor splice junction of exon 8 of the PSMC3IP gene, resulting in
deletion of glu201. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
deletion, which was not found in 254 ethnically matched chromosomes.
RT-PCR analysis of leukocyte DNA from affected and unaffected family
members showed no alternative splicing, suggesting that the mutation
does not affect PSMC3IP splicing. Transfection studies in the IGROV1
ovarian carcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
the glu201del mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven
transcription.

157660	TITLE *157660 MITOCHONDRIAL RNA-PROCESSING ENDORIBONUCLEASE, RNA COMPONENT OF; RMRP
;;RMRPR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondrial RNA-processing endoribonuclease cleaves mitochondrial RNA
complementary to the light chain of the displacement loop at a unique
site (Chang and Clayton, 1987). The enzyme is a ribonucleoprotein whose
RNA component is a nuclear gene product. The RNA component is the first
RNA encoded by a single-copy gene in the nucleus and imported into
mitochondria. The RMRP gene is untranslated, i.e., it encodes an RNA,
not a protein.

MAPPING

By study of interspecific somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization, Hsieh et al. (1989, 1990) located the RMRP gene to
9p21-p12. By interspecific hybrids, the corresponding gene was assigned
to mouse chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

Clayton (2001) discussed the probable function of RMRP.

To provide a physiologic demonstration of a function for RNase MRP in
mammalian cells, Thiel et al. (2005) performed functional studies in
yeast and humans. They showed that different RMRP gene mutations lead to
decreased cell growth by impairing ribosomal assembly and by altering
cyclin-dependent cell cycle regulation. Clinical heterogeneity was
explained by a correlation between the level and type of functional
impairment in vitro and the severity of short stature or predisposition
to cancer. Whereas the cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250) founder 70A-G
mutation (157660.0001) affected both pathways intermediately, mutations
resulting in anauxetic dysplasia (607095) did not affect B-cyclin
(123836) mRNA levels but did severely incapacitate ribosomal assembly
via defective endonucleolytic cleavage. Anauxetic dysplasia mutations
thus lead to poor processing of ribosomal RNA while allowing normal mRNA
processing and, therefore, genetically separate the different functions
of RNase MRP.

Maida et al. (2009) demonstrated that TERT (187270) interacts with RMRP,
which is mutated in cartilage-hair hypoplasia. Human TERT and RMRP form
a distinct ribonucleoprotein complex that has RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase activity and produces double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that can
be processed into small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a Dicer
(606241)-dependent manner. Maida et al. (2009) showed that the human
TERT-RMRP RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) shows a strong preference
for RNA templates that can form 3-prime fold-back structures. Using RMRP
as a template, the TERT-RMRP RdRP produces dsRNAs that are processed by
Dicer into 22-nucleotide dsRNAs that contain 5-prime monophosphate and
3-prime hydroxyl groups that are loaded into AGO2 (606229), confirming
that these short RNAs represent endogenous siRNAs. The involvement of
human TERT in 2 syndromes characterized by stem cell failure
(cartilage-hair hypoplasia and dyskeratosis congenita, 127550) suggested
to Maida et al. (2009) that ribonucleoprotein complexes containing TERT
have a critical role in stem cell biology.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using a positional cloning strategy and mutation analysis, Ridanpaa et
al. (2001) showed that mutations in the RMRP gene are responsible for
cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH; 250250), an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by disproportionate short stature, hypoplastic hair,
ligamentous laxity, defective immunity, hypoplastic anemia, and neuronal
dysplasia of the intestine. The mutations identified in patients with
CHH were of 2 distinct types. The first category consisted of insertions
or duplications between 6 and 30 nucleotides long residing in the region
between the TATA box and the transcription initiation site. These
mutations interfered with the transcription of the RMRP gene. The second
category consisted of single-nucleotide substitutions and other changes
involving at most 2 nucleotides. These resided in highly conserved
residues of the transcribed sequence.

Ridanpaa et al. (2002) described 36 different mutations in the RMRP gene
in 91 Finnish and 44 non-Finnish CHH families. Based on their nature and
localization, these mutations could be classified into 3 categories:
mutations affecting the promoter region, small changes of conserved
nucleotides in the transcript, and insertions and duplications in the
5-prime end of the transcript. The only region of known function that
seemed to avoid mutations was the nucleolar localization signal region
between nucleotides 23 and 62. Eight different mutations in the promoter
region and 28 mutations in the RNA coding region of 267 nucleotides were
reported. The most common mutation in CHH patients was the 70A-G
transition (157600.0001). This mutation represented 92% of the mutations
in Finnish CHH patients. Studies of linkage disequilibrium based on
maximum likelihood estimates with close markers, genealogic studies, and
haplotype data suggested that the mutation was introduced to Finland
some 3,900 to 4,800 years ago and before the expansion of the
population. The same major mutation accounted for 48% of the mutations
among CHH patients from other parts of Europe, North and South America,
the Near East, and Australia. In the non-Finnish CHH families, the 70A-G
mutation segregated with the same major haplotype, although shorter, as
in most of the Finnish families. In 23 of these 27 chromosomes, the
common region extended over 60 kb; therefore, all the chromosomes most
likely arose from a solitary event many thousands of years ago.

Among the sporadic cases of CHH in which Ridanpaa et al. (2002)
identified mutations in the RMRP gene were 1 from China, 2 from Israel,
and 1 from Turkey. Families with more than 1 affected member affected by
CHH and found to have RMRP mutations were from Saudi Arabia and Poland.

Nakashima et al. (2003) identified novel mutations in the RMRP gene in
Japanese patients, but did not find the 70A-G common founder mutation in
any of the 12 patients studied.

Sequencing 120 RMRP alleles from a control group, Bonafe et al. (2002)
found an unusually high density of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in and around the RMRP gene. The biologic significance of this
finding was unclear.

Upon finding causative mutations in the RMRP gene, Bonafe et al. (2002)
concluded that recessive metaphyseal dysplasia without hypotrichosis
(250460) is a variant of CHH, manifesting only as short stature and
metaphyseal dysplasia. Ridanpaa et al. (2003) studied the RMRP gene and
RNase P (H1RNA; 608513) in 20 patients with the diagnosis of Schmid-type
metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (156500) but no mutations detectable in the
COL10A1 gene (120110). Two patients were found to be homozygous for a
70A-G transition in the RMRP gene, which is the major mutation causing
CHH. The description suggests the metaphyseal dysplasia without
hypotrichosis described by Bonafe et al. (2002); the affected
individuals reported by Bonafe et al. (2002) were compound heterozygous
for the common Finnish mutation (157660.0001) and a duplication mutation
(157660.0005) in the RMRP gene.

Kuijpers et al. (2003) described a female patient in whom the diagnosis
of kyphomelic dysplasia (211350) was made in infancy because of her
short-limb dwarfism and kyphomelia, especially of the femurs. She
developed a combined aplastic anemia and immunodeficiency by the age of
2 years. These responded well to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
from her HLA-identical brother at the age of 3 years. Growth remained
extremely retarded, however. Clinical and radiologic features reported
up to the age of 8 years gradually changed and became more typical for
CHH, as was confirmed by the finding of compound heterozygosity for 2
novel mutations in the RMRP gene: 195insT (157660.0016) and 63C-T
(157660.0017). The 63C-T mutation was said to have previously been found
in an Australian CHH patient. Both mutations resided in evolutionarily
conserved nucleotides and were not found in healthy controls. Molecular
studies in the parents showed the father to have the 195insT and the
mother to have the 63C-T mutation.

Thiel et al. (2005) performed positional cloning at the locus for
anauxetic dysplasia (607095), a rare autosomal recessive
spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia characterized by the prenatal onset of
extreme short stature, an adult height of less than 85 cm, hypodontia,
and mild mental retardation. Homozygosity mapping led to the
identification of novel mutations in the RMRP gene
(157660.0018-157660.0021), indicating that the disorder is allelic to
cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250) as well as to metaphyseal dysplasia
without hypotrichosis.

Hermanns et al. (2005) studied the effects of mutations in both the
promoter and the transcribed region of RMRP. While mutations in the
promoter abolished transcription in vitro, RMRP RNA levels in patients
with transcribed mutations were also decreased, suggesting an unstable
RNA. RMRP mutations introduced into the yeast ortholog nuclear
mitochondrial endonuclease-1 (Nme1) exhibited normal mitochondrial
function, chromosomal segregation, and cell cycle progression, while a
CHH fibroblast cell line exhibited normal mitochondrial content.
However, the most commonly found mutation in CHH patients, 70A-G
(157660.0001), caused an alteration in ribosomal processing by altering
the ratio of the short versus the long form of the 5.8S rRNA in yeast.
Transcriptional profiling of CHH patient RNAs showed upregulation of
several cytokines and cell cycle regulatory genes, 1 of which has been
implicated in chondrocyte hypertrophy. Hermanns et al. (2005) suggested
that alteration of ribosomal processing in CHH may be associated with
altered cytokine signaling and cell cycle progression in terminally
differentiating cells in the lymphocytic and chondrocytic cell lineages.

Hirose et al. (2006) screened 9 Japanese patients for mutations in the
RMRP gene and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations
in 6 patients. The authors noted that the 70A-G founder mutation
prevalent in Western populations had not been found in Japanese
patients, whereas 2 mutations common in Japanese patients, 218A-G
(157660.0013) and a 17-bp duplication at nucleotide +3 (157660.0014),
had not been reported in other populations. Haplotype analysis revealed
that the 2 latter mutations were contained within rare distinct
haplotypes, indicating the presence of unique founders among Japanese
CHH patients. Hirose et al. (2006) observed that none of the Japanese
patients they evaluated exhibited all of the skeletal, hair, and
immunologic features characteristic of classic CHH.

In 27 CHH patients referred for molecular evaluation of the clinical
diagnosis, Hermanns et al. (2006) found RMRP mutations in 22. The
phenotype in 1 of the 5 mutation-negative patients was fully congruent
with the adopted case definition of CHH. In a second of these patients,
the diagnosis of Schmid type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (156500) was
made and confirmed by the detection of a mutation in the COL10A1 gene.
The remaining patients most likely represented one or more metaphyseal
chondrodysplasias not hitherto delineated. The pattern of cumulative
growth in infancy and early childhood in the latter 4 patients was the
single feature with greatest negative predictive power for CHH. Fourteen
of the mutations reported by Hermanns et al. (2006) had not been
reported previously. Only 4 of 22 CHH patients were homozygous for the
70A-G mutation. Ridanpaa et al. (2002) postulated that the 70A-G
mutation was of ancient founder origin.

Thiel et al. (2007) stated that in addition to the founder mutation
70A-G, which is present in 92% of Finnish and 48% of non-Finnish
patients with CHH, a total of 25 insertions or duplications between the
TATA box and the transcription start site and more than 62 other
mutations within the RMRP gene had been identified in patients with
phenotypes in the cartilage hair hypoplasia-anauxetic dysplasia (CHH-AD)
spectrum. That spectrum, ranging from the milder phenotypes metaphyseal
dysplasia without hypotrichosis (250460) and CHH to the severe anauxetic
dysplasia, includes different degrees of short stature, hair hypoplasia,
defective erythrogenesis, and immunodeficiency. To investigate the
genotype-phenotype correlation, Thiel et al. (2007) analyzed the
position and the functional effect of 13 mutations in patients with
variable features of the CHH-AD spectrum. Those at the severe end of the
spectrum included a patient with anauxetic dysplasia who was compound
heterozygous for a null deletion mutation (157660.0022) and the 195C-T
mutation (see 157660.0009), which had been described in patients with
milder phenotypes. Mapping of nucleotide conservation to the
2-dimensional structure of the RMRP transcript showed that
disease-causing mutations either affect evolutionarily conserved
nucleotides or are likely to alter secondary structure through
mispairing in stem regions. In vitro testing of mitochondrial
RNA-processing ribonuclease multiprotein-specific mRNA and rRNA cleavage
of different mutations showed a strong correlation between the decrease
in rRNA cleavage in ribosomal assembly and the degree of bone dysplasia,
whereas reduced mRNA cleavage, and thus cell-cycle impairment, predicted
the presence of hair hypoplasia, immunodeficiency, and hematologic
abnormalities and thus increased cancer risk.

Nakashima et al. (2007) performed RT-PCR analysis of cDNA from CHH
patients carrying RMRP mutations, including 2 promoter mutations, a
16-bp duplication at +1 and a 17-bp duplication at +3 (157660.0014), and
2 transcribed mutations, 168G-A and 218A-G (157660.0013), and confirmed
lower expression levels of RMRP for all mutations. By 5-prime RACE
analysis, they showed that reduced transcription in the promoter mutants
was accompanied by shifting of the transcription initiation sites to
nucleotides 5-prime upstream of the authentic site. By RT-PCR analysis
of mouse fibroblasts transfected with transcribed mutant RMRP, they
confirmed reduced RMRP expression. Reduced transcription correlated with
greater instability of mutant RMRP transcripts compared to controls. A
comparable reduction of transcription was seen when the major CHH
mutation 70A-G was introduced into mouse ES cells, and low expression
level of the 70A-G Rmrp RNA was confirmed by expression assays in
cultured cells, and again correlated with RNA instability. Nakashima et
al. (2007) concluded that loss of mutant RNA transcripts is a critical
feature of pathogenesis of CHH.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS, INCLUDED
RMRP, 70A-G

Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for an A-to-G transition
at nucleotide 70 (70A-G) of the RMRP gene in 42 Finnish families with
cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), including 12 with more than 1
affected child and 30 with a single affected child. All of these
families carried modifications of the ancestral haplotype of DNA
polymorphisms. In additional CHH patients, the authors identified the
70A-G mutation in compound heterozygosity with another RMRP mutation
(e.g., 157660.0002). Another patient, who had been described as patient
A by Sulisalo et al. (1997), had uniparental disomy for chromosome 9
with 2 copies of the maternal, 70A-G mutation-carrying chromosome, and
no paternal chromosome 9. The 70A-G mutation was detected in
heterozygosity in 1 of 120 Finnish control samples and in 2 of 160
non-Finnish control samples.

Ridanpaa et al. (2003) reported that the most frequent, and perhaps
only, mutation causing CHH in the Old Order Amish in the United States
(in whom the disorder was first described) is the same 70A-G transition
that is the major mutation causing CHH in Finns. They stated that
although more than 40 different mutations in the RMRP gene had been
characterized in other populations, 70A-G was the most common
CHH-causing mutation worldwide. The mutation segregates with the same
major haplotype in Finns and Amish and others, suggesting that it is
very ancient.

Bonafe et al. (2002) found the common Finnish mutation in compound
heterozygous state with another mutation of RMRP (157660.0005) in
patients with a clinical picture of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia without
hypotrichosis (250460).

Ridanpaa et al. (2003) found homozygosity for the common Finnish
mutation in 2 of 20 Canadian patients diagnosed with Schmid-type
metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (156500) without the usual autosomal
dominant mutation in COL10A1 (120110). The patients later developed
features more typical of CHH.

Hermanns et al. (2006) found the 70A-G mutation in patient number 1 of
Williams et al. (2005) with CHH complicated by severe macrocytic anemia.
Repeated transfusions with irradiated packed red blood cells were
required. The patient remained transfusion-dependent but showed no signs
of compromised immunity. The usually mild anemia of CHH is most probably
self-limited. However, over half of CHH patients with severe anemia may
require life-long transfusions and bone marrow transplantation (Williams
et al., 2005).

The so-called Finnish-Amish common transition 70A-G was observed in 12
alleles among 22 confirmed CHH patients (27%) by Hermanns et al. (2006).

CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 262G-T

In 6 Finnish families with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), including
1 family with 2 affected children, Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 262 (262G-T) of the RMRP gene in
compound heterozygosity with the 70A-G mutation (157660.0001). The
chromosomes carrying the 262G-T mutation shared a haplotype that
differed from that of the main ancestral one. The 262G-T mutation was
not detected in any of 120 Finnish and 160 non-Finnish controls.

.0003
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 10-BP DUP, NT-13

Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified a 10-bp duplication (TACTCTGTGA) at
position -13 of the RMRP gene in compound heterozygosity with the 70A-G
mutation (157660.0001) in 2 Finnish families with cartilage-hair
hypoplasia (250250). The chromosomes carrying this mutation shared a
haplotype that differed from the ancestral one. This and all other
duplication-insertions found in the RMRP gene were not detected in 120
Finnish and 160 non-Finnish controls.

occurred twice at position -10 of the RMRP gene in compound
heterozygosity with a 2-bp duplication at nucleotide 98 (157660.0005).

.0005
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 2-BP DUP, 98TG

Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified a 2-bp duplication (TG) at nucleotide
98 of the RMRP gene in compound heterozygosity with a 15-bp duplication
at position -10 (157660.0004) in a Swiss patient with cartilage-hair

In an English patient with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), Ridanpaa
et al. (2001) identified an 18-bp duplication (TCTGTGAAGCTGAGGAC) at
position -3 of the RMRP gene in compound heterozygosity with a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 193 (193G-A; 157660.0008). The 193G-A mutation
was not found in 112 Finnish and 93 non-Finnish controls.

METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS
RMRP, 195C-T, 238C-T, 12-BP DUP

In 2 unrelated boys with short stature and metaphyseal dysplasia similar
to CHH, but lacking hair anomalies, immunodeficiency, and other
extraskeletal features (metaphyseal dysplasia without hypotrichosis;
250460), Bonafe et al. (2002) identified mutations in the RMRP gene. One
allele was the common Finnish mutation (157660.0001). The other 3
alleles in the 2 boys carried +195C-T, +238C-T, and a 12-bp duplication
at -2. One boy was of Swiss and Danish extraction, the other of Austrian
origin.

METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS
RMRP, 17-BP INS, NT-20

Nakashima et al. (2003) described a 7-year-old Japanese girl who had
skeletal changes consistent with CHH but showed neither hypoplastic hair
nor immunodeficiency. Radiography showed brachydactyly with cone-shaped
epiphyses in the phalanges of the hands and metaphyseal dysplasia in the
long and short tubular bones, especially in the distal femur. Mutation
analysis showed compound heterozygosity for mutations in the RMRP gene:
a 17-bp insertion (TCTGTGAAGCTGGGGAC) at -20 and a 218A-G transition
(157660.0013). The insertion was found on the paternal allele and the
nucleotide substitution on the maternal allele.

RMRP, 17-BP DUP, NT3

In a Japanese patient with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), Nakashima
et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RMRP gene: a 17-bp duplication (GAAGCTGAGGACGTGGT) at +3 inherited from
the mother and a de novo 182G-A mutation (157660.0015). Parenthood was
confirmed by testing for polymorphic markers.

See 157660.0014 and Nakashima et al. (2003). Nakashima et al. (2003)
stated that the 182G-A mutation was the first de novo mutation in the
RMRP gene to be reported.

CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 1-BP INS, 195T

Kuijpers et al. (2003) described a girl who in the first 2 years of life
was thought to have kyphomelic dysplasia (211350) because of her
short-limb dwarfism and bowed extremities affecting especially the
femurs. At the age of 2 years she developed a combined immunodeficiency
and aplastic anemia that responded well to allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation, although growth remained extremely retarded. Over 8
years of observation, clinical and radiologic symptoms gradually changed
and became more typical for CHH (250250). Compound heterozygosity for 2
novel mutations in the RMRP gene were found: 195insT and 63C-T
(157660.0013).

RMRP, 14-BP INS, NT111

In 3 affected members of a Jordanian family with anauxetic dysplasia
(607095) reported by Menger et al. (1996), Thiel et al. (2005) found
homozygosity for an insertion of 14 nucleotides between nucleotides 111
and 112 of the RMRP cDNA. The parents were consanguineous.

.0019
ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA
RMRP, 14G-A

In the German family with anauxetic dysplasia (607095) reported by Horn
et al. (2001), Thiel et al. (2005) found that both affected members were
compound heterozygous for 2 mutations of the RMRP gene: 14G-A and
90_91AG-GC (157660.0020).

.0020
ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA
RMRP, AG-GC, NT90

In a family with 2 affected children with anauxetic dysplasia (607095)
reported by Horn et al. (2001) and in a single patient, Thiel et al.
(2005) found the same mutation in the RMRP gene, 90_91AG-GC. The family
and the single patient were from the same region of Germany and carried
the 90_91AG-GC mutation on the same ancestral haplotype, confirming a
founder effect. The mutation occurred in compound heterozygosity in all
3 individuals, with a 14G-A mutation in the family (157660.0019) and
with a 254C-G mutation in the single patient (157660.0021).

.0021
ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA
RMRP, 254C-G

Thiel et al. (2005) found an individual with anauxetic dysplasia
(607095), the offspring of nonconsanguineous parents, to be compound
heterozygous for 90_91AG-GC (157660.0020) and 254C-G mutations in the
RMRP gene.

found compound heterozygosity for a 10-bp null mutation of the RMRP gene
(254_263delCTCAGCGCGG) and the transcribed mutation 195C-T
(157660.0009), which had been previously described in patients with
milder phenotypes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian HMGIY/C (HMGA; also see 600698) nonhistone chromosomal
proteins, which are often referred to as architectural proteins,
participate in a wide variety of cellular processes including regulation
of inducible gene transcription, integration of retroviruses into
chromosomes, and the induction of neoplastic transformation and
promotion of metastatic progression of cancer cells. They are
characterized by the presence of 3 copies of a conserved DNA-binding
peptide motif (AT-hook) that preferentially binds with the minor groove
of many AT-rich promoter and enhancer DNA regulatory elements. Although
they possess no substantial secondary structure while free in solution,
they organize the framework of the nucleoprotein-DNA transcriptional
complex through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. These
interactions induce both structural changes in chromatin substrates and
the formation of stereospecific complexes called 'enhanceosomes' on the
promoter/enhancer regions of genes whose transcription they regulate
(Grosschedl et al., 1994; Reeves and Beckerbauer, 2001).

CLONING

Brunetti et al. (1993) identified 2 nuclear binding proteins that
interact with 2 unique regions of the insulin receptor (INSR; 147670)
promoter and increase both myocyte and adipocyte differentiation. DNase
I footprinting localized nuclear binding to AT-rich regions of the INSR
promoter between nucleotides -782 to -800 and -1740 to -1775. Reporter
gene analysis of the DNA sequences that interacted with these proteins
indicated that they had in vitro transcriptional activity and functioned
primarily as promoter elements.

Johnson et al. (1989) obtained several HMGA1 (HMGI/Y) cDNA clones from a
Raji human lymphocyte cDNA library. The deduced full-length protein,
HMGI (HMGA1a), contains 107 amino acids, and a splice variant, HMGY
(HMGA1b), has an internal deletion of 11 amino acids in comparison with
HMGI. Most other clones showed alternative splicing at the 5-prime UTR.
By screening a human genomic library, Johnson et al. (1989) isolated
several clones containing HMGI/Y pseudogenes.

By screening a human B-lymphocyte cDNA expression library for proteins
that bound to AT-rich stretches of duplex DNA, Eckner and Birnstiel
(1989) cloned human HMGI and HMGY. The HMGI protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 11.7 kD, and the HMGY protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 10.7 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 2-kb
transcript in all tissues examined. An erythroid cell line had an
additional transcript of about 3.8 kb.

Reeves and Beckerbauer (2001) stated that another HMGA1 isoform that
results from alternative splicing, HMGA1c (HMGI/R), contains 179 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 19.7 kD.

Liu et al. (2000) determined that alternative splicing within exon 3 of
the mouse Hmga1 gene results in 2 protein isoforms, Hmgi and Hmgy.
Northern blot analysis detected high Hmga1 expression through
embryogenesis in the mouse. Ubiquitous but variable Hmga1 expression was
detected in adult mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Eckner and Birnstiel (1989) showed that both recombinant human HMGI and
HMGY, expressed in E. coli, bound specifically to AT-rich stretches of
DNA, suggesting that no posttranslational modifications are necessary
for specific DNA binding by these proteins.

Aberrant expression of MYC (190080) plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of several human malignancies, most notably Burkitt
lymphoma (113970). MYC functions as a transcription factor that works in
conjunction with a partner protein, MAX (154950). By mutagenesis
analysis of the mouse Hmgiy promoter, Wood et al. (2000) identified a
Myc-Max consensus DNA-binding site, an E box at nucleotide -1337.
Northern blot analysis detected enhanced expression of Hmgiy after
stimulation by hydroxytamoxifen in a cell line expressing a
Myc-estradiol receptor fusion protein. Myc-deficient fibroblasts had
reduced expression of Hmgiy. Western blot analysis detected increased
expression of HMGIY protein in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines compared with
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes from a normal individual.
An antisense construct decreased HMGIY protein expression, abrogated
transformation of Burkitt lymphoma cells, and decreased the cell growth
rate. Rat and human cell lines overexpressing HMGIY formed colonies in
soft agar, and the rat cell line was tumorigenic in athymic nude mice.
The results suggested that HMGIY is a potential oncogene.

HMGIY orchestrates the assembly of a virus-induced enhanceosome, which
consists of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; 164011), interferon regulatory
factors (e.g., IRF1; 147575), and ATF2 (123811)/JUN (see 165160), by
mediating a network of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions
(Thanos and Maniatis, 1995). The enhanceosome, which is assembled in a
nucleosome-free enhancer region, activates transcription of
beta-interferon (IFNB; 147640) through a program of chromatin-modifying
activities that target a strategically positioned nucleosome that masks
the TATA box and start site of transcription (Agalioti et al., 2000).
Enhanceosome-activated transcription requires the recruitment of histone
acetyltransferase proteins that modify histones and acetylate HMGIY.
Munshi et al. (2001) showed that the accurate execution of the IFNB
transcriptional switch depends on the ordered acetylation of HMGIY by
CREB-binding protein (CBP; 600140) and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF;
602303)/GCN5 (602301). Acetylation of HMGIY by CBP at lys65 destabilizes
the enhanceosome, whereas acetylation by PCAF/GCN5 at lys71, which lies
in a critical protein-protein interaction domain, potentiates
transcription by stabilizing the enhanceosome and by preventing
acetylation by CBP.

By purification and molecular characterization, Brunetti et al. (2001)
found that HMGIY bound and activated 2 AT-rich regions in the insulin
receptor (INSR; 147670) promoter. Knockdown of HMGIY via antisense RNA
reduced surface expression of INSR in 2 human cell lines that normally
express high INSR levels. Conversely, transfection of HMGIY elevated
surface expression of INSR in 2 cell lines that normally express little
INSR.

Foti et al. (2005) reported 4 patients with insulin resistance and type
II diabetes (125853) in whom cell surface insulin receptors were
decreased and INSR gene transcription was impaired, although the INSR
genes were normal. One of the patients had previously been described by
Brunetti et al. (1996) and another by Foti et al. (2003). In all 4
patients, expression of HMGA1 was markedly reduced; restoration of HMGA1
protein expression in their cells enhanced INSR gene transcription and
restored cell surface insulin receptor protein expression and
insulin-binding capacity. Foti et al. (2005) concluded that defects in
HMGA1 may cause decreased insulin receptor expression and induce insulin
resistance.

Pierantoni et al. (2007) found that HMGA1 overexpression interfered with
p53 (TP53; 191170)-induced apoptosis by preventing nuclear localization
of HIPK2 (606868) and phosphorylation of ser46 of p53. These events
could be restored by overexpression of HIPK2 or treatment with
antisense-HMGA1. Immunohistochemical analysis of breast cancers
demonstrated a significant association of HMGA1 overexpression, HIPK2
cytoplasmic localization, and low spontaneous apoptosis in the presence
of wildtype p53. Pierantoni et al. (2007) concluded that HMGA1 exerts
its tumorigenic activity by forcing cytoplasmic localization of HIPK2,
thus inhibiting p53 apoptotic function.

Using several criteria, Chiefari et al. (2012) found that HMGA1 directly
bound promoters and activated expression of genes downregulated by
insulin, including IGFBP1 (146730), PEPCK (PCK1; 614168), and G6Pase
(G6PC; 613742), as well as INSR. In mice, Hmga1 bound the Igfbp1 locus
under fasting conditions, and Hmga1-DNA interaction promptly decreased
upon refeeding or following insulin administration. In transfected
HEK293 cells, insulin induced phosphorylation of HMGA1 at 3 serines in a
C-terminal domain critical for DNA binding. Insulin-dependent
phosphorylation of HMGA1 in HepG2 cells caused redistribution of HMGA1
from active euchromatin in the nuclear interior to inactive
heterochromatin in the nuclear periphery. Insulin failed to suppress
Insr mRNA in hepatocytes cultured from Hmga1-null mice. Chiefari et al.
(2012) concluded that HMGA1 is a critical insulin target gene required
for maintenance of glucose homeostasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2000) determined that the mouse Hmga1 gene contains 6 exons,
the first 2 of which are noncoding. Pedulla et al. (2001) determined
that the HMGA1 gene spans about 9.3 kb and contains 8 exons, the first 3
of which are noncoding. The mouse Hmga1 gene lacks the equivalent of
human exons 3 and 4. Pedulla et al. (2001) noted that the promoter
regions of the mouse and human HMGA1 genes contain conserved binding
sites for MYC and AP1 (see 165160) and other transcription factors.

MAPPING

Friedmann et al. (1993) mapped the gene encoding high mobility group
protein HMGIY to 6p23-p21 by analysis of hamster/human somatic cell
hybrids and radiation hybrids. This is also the site of aberrations
observed in lipomas and other mesenchymal tumors. Since the structurally
closely related HMGIC gene (HMGA2; 600698) on chromosome 12 is involved
also in lipomas and other mesenchymal tumors, a role for HMGIY is worthy
of investigation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chiefari et al. (2011) performed a case-control analysis of the HMGA1
gene in 4,602 patients with type II diabetes mellitus (125853) and 4,336
controls from Italy, United States, and France. All participants were of
non-Hispanic white European ancestry. Genomic DNA was either directly
sequenced or analyzed for specific HMGA1 mutations. mRNA and protein
expression for HMGA1 and insulin receptor were measured in both
peripheral lymphomonocytes and cultured Epstein-Barr virus-transformed
lymphoblasts from patient with type II diabetes mellitus and controls.
The most frequent HMGA1 variant, IVS5-13insC (600701.0001), was present
in 7 to 8% of patients with type II diabetes in all 3 populations. The
IVS5-13insC variant resulted in significantly reduced HMGA1 mRNA and
protein in blood monocytes from patients with type II diabetes compared
with healthy controls. This reduction of HMGA1 mRNA was associated with
decreased expression of the insulin receptor (INSR; 147670).

ANIMAL MODEL

In Hmga1-deficient mice, Foti et al. (2005) observed decreased insulin
receptor expression in muscle, fat, and liver, largely impaired insulin
signaling, and severely reduced insulin secretion, causing a phenotype
characteristic of human type II diabetes.

Fedele et al. (2006) found that both Hmga1 -/- and Hmga1 +/- mice showed
cardiac hypertrophy due to the role of Hmga1 on cardiomyocytic cell
growth regulation. These mice also developed hematologic malignancies,
including B-cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemias. Spleen tissues
exhibited B-cell expansion and increased expression of Rag1
(179615)/Rag2 (179616) endonuclease, which may have been responsible for
the increased IgH rearrangements observed in neoplasias. Fedele et al.
(2006) concluded that HMGA1 has a critical role in heart development and
growth and an antioncogenic potential in hematologic malignancies.

In a case-control study of the HMGA1 gene in type II diabetes mellitus
(125853) involving 3 populations of white European ancestry (4,602
patients and 4,336 controls from Italy, United States, and France),
Chiefari et al. (2011) found that insertion of a C at the -13 position
of intron 5 of the HMGA1 gene (IVS5-13insC) was present in 7 to 8% of
patients. The prevalence of IVS5-13insC variant was higher among
patients than among controls in the Italian population (7.23% vs 0.43%
in 1 control group, OR = 15.77, 95% CI 8.57-29.03, P less than 0.001;
and 7.23% vs 3.32% in the other control group, OR = 2.03, 95% CI
1.51-3.43, P less than 0.001). In the United States population, the
prevalence of the IVS5-13insC variant was 7.7% among patients with type
II diabetes versus 4.7% among controls (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.05-2.57, P =
0.03). In the French population, the prevalence of IVS5-13insC variant
was 7.6% among patients with type II diabetes and 0.0% among controls (P
= 0.046). In the Italian population, 3 other functional variants were
observed. One of these variants, *369del (heterozygous deletion of a G
369 bases 3-prime of the stop codon in cDNA) had been reported by Foti
et al. (2005). When all 4 variants were analyzed, HMGA1 defects were
present in 9.8% of Italian patients with type II diabetes and 0.6% of
controls. In circulating monocytes and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed
lymphoblasts from patients with type II diabetes and the IVS5-13insC
variant, the mRNA levels and protein content of both HMGA1 and the
insulin receptor (INSR; 147670) were decreased by 40 to 50%, and these
defects were corrected by transfection with HMGA1 cDNA.

138322	TITLE *138322 GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE 4; GPX4
;;PHOSPHOLIPID HYDROPEROXIDE GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE; PHGPX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPX4 reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides within membranes and
lipoproteins and acts in conjunction with alpha-tocopherol to inhibit
lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is implicated in a number of
pathophysiologic processes, including inflammation and atherogenesis.
GPX4 is a selenoprotein whose production and activity are sensitive to
selenium (Se), which is incorporated into selenoproteins as
selenocysteine (summary by Sneddon et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using porcine Phgpx to screen a testis cDNA library, Esworthy et al.
(1994) cloned human GPX4, which they called PHGPX. The 3-prime UTR
contains a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) required for
insertion of selenocysteine at an opal codon (UGA). The deduced
197-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 19 kD. It has
putative active-site tryptophan and glutamic acid residues that are
predicted to interact with selenocysteine, and a tyrosine residue that
is phosphorylated in the porcine protein.

By fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy of resting human
platelets, Januel et al. (2006) showed that GPX4 associated with
membranes, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, and that GPX4 activity showed an
identical distribution. Western blot analysis detected GPX4 at an
apparent molecular mass of 20 to 21 kD.

Roveri et al. (1992) found that rat Gpx4 was present primarily in
testis. Januel et al. (2006) stated that rat has mitochondrial and
nonmitochondrial forms of Gpx4.

Borchert et al. (2003) characterized the expression of 2 major isoforms
of Gpx4 in mouse tissues. One isoform, which they designated the
phospholipid (phGpx) form, was expressed in many tissues. The other,
designated the sperm nucleus (snGpx) isoform, was detected in mouse
testis and kidney, as well as in a human embryonic kidney cell line.
Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy revealed
cytosolic localization. Immunohistochemical staining of mouse kidneys
showed staining for snGpx in cortical and medullary interstitial cells.
Analysis of the 5-prime flanking region common to both isoforms revealed
strong promoter activity. The snGpx4 promoter, which contains 334 bp of
intronic sequence, suppressed the activity of the common promoter.

GENE FUNCTION

In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Sneddon et al.
(2003) observed a dose-dependent increase in GPX4 mRNA and protein
levels with increasing Se concentration until the Se concentration
reached 76 nM. GPX4 enzyme activity was optimum at an even higher Se
concentration. Sneddon et al. (2003) noted that these findings
contrasted with findings in other tissues and cell types, suggesting
that Se regulates GPX4 in a tissue- and cell-type specific manner,
possibly reflecting the relative importance of GPX4 in individual
tissues. They also found that, in addition to Se, fatty acids,
cytokines, and redox state regulated GPX4 expression and activity, but
sometimes in different and opposing ways.

Activation of platelets by agonists such as thrombin (F2; 176930) leads
to a dramatic increase in cell surface expression of several receptors,
as well as changes in platelet shape, release of arachidonic acid from
phospholipids, and increased level of peroxides. Using fractionated
human platelets and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, Januel et
al. (2006) found that GPX4 protein and enzymatic activity redistributed
from the cytosol to membranes following platelet activation. They
hypothesized that mobilization of GPX4 toward membranes protects
platelets against the burst of lipid hydroperoxides and limits the stage
of activation.

By yeast 3-hybrid screening of a mouse testis cDNA library, followed by
RNA mobility gel shift assays, Ufer et al. (2008) found that the
RNA-binding protein Grsf1 (604851) bound an AGGGGA motif in the 5-prime
UTR of mitochondrial Gpx4. Grsf1 upregulated Gpx4 UTR-dependent reporter
gene expression, recruited mitochondrial Gpx4 mRNA to translationally
active polysomes, and coimmunoprecipitated with Gpx4 mRNA. During
embryonic mouse brain development, Grsf1 and mitochondrial Gpx4 were
coexpressed, and knockdown of Grsf1 via small interfering RNA prevented
embryonic Gpx4 expression. Compared with mock controls, Grsf1-knockdown
embryos showed developmental retardation that paralleled increased
apoptosis and massive lipid peroxidation. Overexpression of
mitochondrial Gpx4 prevented the apoptotic changes and rescued
development in Grsf1-knockdown embryos. Ufer et al. (2008) concluded
that GRSF1 upregulates translation of GPX4 mRNA and that both proteins
are required for embryonic brain development.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

To overcome inefficient selenocysteine-incorporating machinery in
recombinant systems, Scheerer et al. (2007) expressed recombinant human
cytosolic GPX4 containing a sec46-to-cys (U46C) mutation, which retains
residual catalytic activity, in E. coli. They solved the crystal
structure of this molecule to 1.55-angstrom resolution. X-ray data
indicated that the monomeric protein consisted of 4 alpha helices and 7
beta strands. The catalytic triad (cys46, gln81, and trp136) localized
at a flat impression on the protein surface extending into a
surface-exposed patch of basic amino acids (lys48, lys135, and arg152)
that also contained polar thr139. Mutation analysis confirmed the
functional importance of the catalytic triad. Like the wildtype enzyme,
the U46C mutant exhibited a strong tendency toward polymerization, which
was prevented by reductants. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested
involvement of the catalytic cys46 and surface-exposed cys10 and cys66
in polymer formation. In GPX4 crystals, these residues contacted
adjacent protein monomers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelner and Montoya (1998) determined that the human GPX4 gene spans 2.8
kb and contains 7 exons. Analysis of the gene sequence identified a
potential alternative tissue-specific first exon.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of genomic DNA from human/hamster somatic cell
hybrids, Chu (1994) showed that the GPX4 gene is located on chromosome
19. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kelner and Montoya (1998)
assigned the gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Villette et al. (2002) examined the 3-prime UTR of the GPX4 gene in 66
healthy Scottish volunteers and identified a T-C SNP at position 718,
near the predicted SECIS element. The distribution of this SNP was in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with 34% CC homozygotes, 25% TT homozygotes,
and 41% TC heterozygotes. Individuals of different genotypes exhibited
significant differences in the levels of lymphocyte 5-lipoxygenase total
products, with CC homozygotes showing 36% and 44% more products than TT
homozygotes and TC heterozygotes, respectively. Villette et al. (2002)
concluded that GPX4 has a regulatory role in leukotriene biosynthesis
and that the 718T-C SNP has functional effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ran et al. (2004) stated that Gpx4 deletion in mice is embryonic lethal,
and that embryonic fibroblasts from Gpx4 +/- mice exhibit increased
lipid peroxidation, more cell death after exposure to oxidizing agents,
and growth retardation under high oxygen levels. They found that
expression of human GPX4 rescued the lethal phenotype of Gpx4 -/- mice.
Transgenic mice overexpressing human GPX4 showed reduced oxidative
injury after oxidative stress.

138322	TITLE *138322 GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE 4; GPX4
;;PHOSPHOLIPID HYDROPEROXIDE GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE; PHGPX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPX4 reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides within membranes and
lipoproteins and acts in conjunction with alpha-tocopherol to inhibit
lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is implicated in a number of
pathophysiologic processes, including inflammation and atherogenesis.
GPX4 is a selenoprotein whose production and activity are sensitive to
selenium (Se), which is incorporated into selenoproteins as
selenocysteine (summary by Sneddon et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using porcine Phgpx to screen a testis cDNA library, Esworthy et al.
(1994) cloned human GPX4, which they called PHGPX. The 3-prime UTR
contains a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) required for
insertion of selenocysteine at an opal codon (UGA). The deduced
197-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 19 kD. It has
putative active-site tryptophan and glutamic acid residues that are
predicted to interact with selenocysteine, and a tyrosine residue that
is phosphorylated in the porcine protein.

By fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy of resting human
platelets, Januel et al. (2006) showed that GPX4 associated with
membranes, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, and that GPX4 activity showed an
identical distribution. Western blot analysis detected GPX4 at an
apparent molecular mass of 20 to 21 kD.

Roveri et al. (1992) found that rat Gpx4 was present primarily in
testis. Januel et al. (2006) stated that rat has mitochondrial and
nonmitochondrial forms of Gpx4.

Borchert et al. (2003) characterized the expression of 2 major isoforms
of Gpx4 in mouse tissues. One isoform, which they designated the
phospholipid (phGpx) form, was expressed in many tissues. The other,
designated the sperm nucleus (snGpx) isoform, was detected in mouse
testis and kidney, as well as in a human embryonic kidney cell line.
Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy revealed
cytosolic localization. Immunohistochemical staining of mouse kidneys
showed staining for snGpx in cortical and medullary interstitial cells.
Analysis of the 5-prime flanking region common to both isoforms revealed
strong promoter activity. The snGpx4 promoter, which contains 334 bp of
intronic sequence, suppressed the activity of the common promoter.

GENE FUNCTION

In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Sneddon et al.
(2003) observed a dose-dependent increase in GPX4 mRNA and protein
levels with increasing Se concentration until the Se concentration
reached 76 nM. GPX4 enzyme activity was optimum at an even higher Se
concentration. Sneddon et al. (2003) noted that these findings
contrasted with findings in other tissues and cell types, suggesting
that Se regulates GPX4 in a tissue- and cell-type specific manner,
possibly reflecting the relative importance of GPX4 in individual
tissues. They also found that, in addition to Se, fatty acids,
cytokines, and redox state regulated GPX4 expression and activity, but
sometimes in different and opposing ways.

Activation of platelets by agonists such as thrombin (F2; 176930) leads
to a dramatic increase in cell surface expression of several receptors,
as well as changes in platelet shape, release of arachidonic acid from
phospholipids, and increased level of peroxides. Using fractionated
human platelets and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, Januel et
al. (2006) found that GPX4 protein and enzymatic activity redistributed
from the cytosol to membranes following platelet activation. They
hypothesized that mobilization of GPX4 toward membranes protects
platelets against the burst of lipid hydroperoxides and limits the stage
of activation.

By yeast 3-hybrid screening of a mouse testis cDNA library, followed by
RNA mobility gel shift assays, Ufer et al. (2008) found that the
RNA-binding protein Grsf1 (604851) bound an AGGGGA motif in the 5-prime
UTR of mitochondrial Gpx4. Grsf1 upregulated Gpx4 UTR-dependent reporter
gene expression, recruited mitochondrial Gpx4 mRNA to translationally
active polysomes, and coimmunoprecipitated with Gpx4 mRNA. During
embryonic mouse brain development, Grsf1 and mitochondrial Gpx4 were
coexpressed, and knockdown of Grsf1 via small interfering RNA prevented
embryonic Gpx4 expression. Compared with mock controls, Grsf1-knockdown
embryos showed developmental retardation that paralleled increased
apoptosis and massive lipid peroxidation. Overexpression of
mitochondrial Gpx4 prevented the apoptotic changes and rescued
development in Grsf1-knockdown embryos. Ufer et al. (2008) concluded
that GRSF1 upregulates translation of GPX4 mRNA and that both proteins
are required for embryonic brain development.

functional importance of the catalytic triad. Like the wildtype enzyme,
the U46C mutant exhibited a strong tendency toward polymerization, which
was prevented by reductants. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested
involvement of the catalytic cys46 and surface-exposed cys10 and cys66
in polymer formation. In GPX4 crystals, these residues contacted
adjacent protein monomers.

Kelner and Montoya (1998) determined that the human GPX4 gene spans 2.8
kb and contains 7 exons. Analysis of the gene sequence identified a
potential alternative tissue-specific first exon.

expression of human GPX4 rescued the lethal phenotype of Gpx4 -/- mice.
Transgenic mice overexpressing human GPX4 showed reduced oxidative

;;FANCONI ANEMIA ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; FAZF;;
TESTIS ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; TZFP;;
REPRESSOR OF GATA; ROG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify FANCC (613899) binding partners that might shed light on the
function of the FA pathway, Hoatlin et al. (1999) used a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a B-cell cDNA library with N-terminal sequences of FANCC as
bait. By confirming the interactions using GST pull-down assays,
followed by RT-PCR, Hoatlin et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding FAZF.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 487-amino acid protein, which is
similar to PLZF (176797), contains an N-terminal POZ/BTB domain and 3
zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis detected weak expression of a
1.4-kb transcript in most tissues tested except peripheral blood
leukocytes, where strong expression was detected, and testis, where
strong expression of 2.0-, 2.7-, and 4.4-kb transcripts was detected.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that FAZF associates with FANCC
independent of the BTB/POZ domain. Indirect immunofluorescence and
confocal microscopy demonstrated almost entirely nuclear expression for
FAZF and colocalization with FANCC, which Hoatlin et al. (1999)
confirmed is also expressed in cytoplasm in some cells; FANCC and PLZF
did not colocalize. EMSA analysis suggested that PLZF and FAZF bind to
CpG islands, interact with each other through the POZ domain of PLZF,
and repress transcription by a similar mechanism.

By database searching, genomic analysis, RT-PCR, and yeast 2-hybrid
screening, Lin et al. (1999) cloned FAZF, which they termed TZFP.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of 3 transcripts only in
testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using genomic sequence analysis, Lin et al. (1999) determined that the
TZFP gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hoatlin et al. (1999) mapped the FAZF gene
to 19q13.1.

608296	TITLE *608296 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR, ACIDIC, INTRACELLULAR BINDING PROTEIN; FIBP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Kolpakova et al. (1998) identified a
HeLa cell cDNA, which the authors termed FIBP, that interacts with
acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF1; 131220). The FIBP cDNA encodes a
deduced 372-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 42 kD.
The protein is mainly hydrophilic and has no N-terminal signal sequence.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that FIBP and FGF1 have similar
expression patterns. FIBP is expressed ubiquitously as an approximately
1.4-kb transcript at highest levels in heart, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, and at somewhat lower levels in brain. In vitro experiments
showed that FIBP readily attaches to microsomal membranes and is capable
of binding FGF1 with high affinity. Immunofluorescence studies
demonstrated that FIBP is mainly localized in the nucleus and to a
lesser extent in mitochondria and other cytoplasmic membranes. Western
blot analysis indicated the presence of 2 forms of FIBP.

By RT-PCR analysis, Kolpakova et al. (2000) identified a second FIBP
transcript caused by alternative splicing of exon 5 and resulting in a
protein with an additional 7 residues. They cloned and characterized the
mouse Fibp gene and, by database searching, identified a Drosophila
homolog. Human FIBP shares 97% and 46% sequence identity with the mouse
and Drosophila homologs, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kolpakova et al. (2000) determined that the FIBP gene contains 10 exons
and spans more than 5 kb. Sequence analysis of the region surrounding
the translation start revealed a CpG island. Functional studies of the
promoter region suggested strong transcriptional activity.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kolpakova et al. (2000) mapped the FIBP gene to chromosome
11q13.1.

606306	TITLE *606306 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 5; PCDHGC5
;;PCDH-GAMMA-C5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGC5
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGC5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGC5 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGC4 gene (606305) and the first exon
of the PCDHG constant region. They localized the mouse PCDHG genes to
chromosome 18c.

The HIP1 gene encodes huntingtin interacting protein-1, which is an
endocytic protein that colocalizes with the adaptor complex AP2 (see,
e.g., AP2A1; 601026) and clathrin to play a role in endocytosis at the
plasma membrane of various cells (summary by Metzler et al., 2003).

CLONING

Huntington disease (HD; 143100) may be due to a toxic gain-of-function
caused by abnormal protein-protein interactions related to the elongated
polyglutamine sequence of huntingtin (HTT: 613004). Thus, the binding of
distinct proteins to the polyglutamine region could either confer a new
property on huntingtin or alter its normal interactions with other
proteins. Wanker et al. (1997) hypothesized that the specific binding of
a protein with a restricted pattern of expression to the elongated
polyglutamine stretch of the huntingtin protein could cause selective
vulnerability to particular cells. The potential huntingtin-interacting
proteins that have been identified include huntingtin-associated
protein-1 (600947), the glycolytic enzyme GAPD (138400), and the
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K, also named HIP2 (602846), which
binds selectively to the N terminus of huntingtin. Wanker et al. (1997)
demonstrated the specific binding of a protein to the N terminus of
huntingtin, both in the yeast 2-hybrid screen and in in vitro binding
experiments. A protein region downstream of the polyglutamine stretch in
huntingtin was essential for the interaction in vitro. Thus, the authors
designated the new protein 'huntingtin-interacting protein-1' (HIP1).
The HIP1 cDNA isolated by the 2-hybrid screen encodes a 55-kD fragment
of the novel protein. Using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody
raised against recombinant HIP1, a protein of 116 kD was detected in
brain extracts by Western blot analysis. The predicted amino acid
sequence of the HIP1 fragment exhibited significant similarity to
cytoskeleton proteins, suggesting to Wanker et al. (1997) that HIP1 and
huntingtin play a functional role in the cell filament network. The HIP1
gene was found to be ubiquitously expressed at low levels in different
brain regions. HIP1 is enriched in human brain but can also be detected
in other human tissues, as well as in mouse brain. The authors noted
that HIP1 and huntingtin behave almost identically during subcellular
fractionation and both proteins are enriched in the membrane-containing
fractions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chopra et al. (2000) determined that the HIP1 gene contains 32 exons
spanning approximately 215 kb of genomic DNA and gives rise to 2
alternative splice forms, termed HIP1-1 and HIP1-2, which differ in
their 5-prime sequence. HIP1-1 encodes a deduced 1,034-amino acid
protein, and HIP1-2 a deduced 1,003-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

To confirm the localization of HIP1 to the same region as
Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050), Wedemeyer et al. (1997) mapped
ELN and HIP1 in a radiation hybrid (RH) panel. HIP1 was found to be
located 2.03 cR proximal to elastin (ELN; 130160) in the RH mapping
panel; the calculated distance between the 2 loci was 200 to 400 kb.
Although this suggested that the HIP1 locus is within the region of WBS
deletion, this was found not to be the case when somatic cell hybrids in
which the deleted and nondeleted chromosome 7 from a typical Williams
syndrome patient had been separated were typed.

Kalchman et al. (1997) assigned the HIP1 gene to human chromosome 7q11.2
by FISH. By radiation hybrid analysis, Wedemeyer et al. (1997) mapped
the HIP1 gene to 17q11.23. Himmelbauer et al. (1998) mapped the mouse
Hip1 gene to chromosome 5.

GENE FUNCTION

Kalchman et al. (1997) showed that HIP1 is a membrane-associated protein
that colocalizes with huntingtin and shares sequence homology and
biochemical characteristics with Sla2p, a protein essential for function
of the cytoskeleton in S. cerevisiae. The huntingtin-HIP1 interaction
was restricted to the brain and correlated inversely with the
polyglutamine length in huntingtin. Their results provided a molecular
link between huntingtin and the neuronal cytoskeleton and suggested
that, in Huntington disease, loss of normal huntingtin-HIP1 interaction
may contribute to a defect in membrane-cytoskeletal integrity in the
brain.

Hackam et al. (2000) found that overexpression of HIP1 in a human
neuronal precursor cell line resulted in caspase-3 (600636)-dependent
activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. They identified a domain
within HIP1 that showed homology to the death effector domain (DED)
found in proteins involved in apoptosis. Expression of the HIP1 DED
domain alone resulted in cell death indistinguishable from that induced
by full-length HIP1. The substitution of a conserved phenylalanine
within the DED domain eliminated HIP1 toxicity.

Waelter et al. (2001) identified 3 HIP1-associated proteins, clathrin
heavy chain (CLTC; 118955) and alpha-adaptin A and C (AP2A1; 601026). In
vitro binding studies revealed that the central coiled-coil domain is
required for the interaction of HIP1 with clathrin, whereas DPF-like
motifs located upstream to this domain are important for the binding of
HIP1 to the C-terminal 'appendage' domain of alpha-adaptin A and C.
Expression of full-length HIP1 in mammalian cells resulted in a punctate
cytoplasmic immunostaining characteristic of clathrin-coated vesicles.
In contrast, when a truncated HIP1 protein containing both the DPF-like
motifs and the coiled-coil domain was overexpressed, large perinuclear
vesicle-like structures containing HIP1, huntingtin, clathrin, and
endocytosed transferrin were observed, suggesting that HIP1 is an
endocytic protein, the structural integrity of which may be crucial for
maintenance of normal vesicle size in vivo.

Gervais et al. (2002) found that HIP1 binds to the HIP1 protein
interactor (HIPPI; 606621), which has partial sequence homology to HIP1
and similar tissue and subcellular distribution. The availability of
free HIP1 is modulated by polyglutamine length within huntingtin, with
disease-associated polyglutamine expansion favoring the formation of
proapoptotic HIPPI-HIP1 heterodimers. This heterodimer can recruit
procaspase-8 (601763) into a complex of HIPPI, HIP1, and procaspase-8,
and launch apoptosis through components of the extrinsic cell death
pathway. Gervais et al. (2002) proposed that huntingtin polyglutamine
expansion liberates HIP1 so that it can form a caspase-8 recruitment
complex with HIPPI, possibly contributing to neuronal death in
Huntington disease.

Rao et al. (2002) found that HIP1 is expressed in prostate and colon
tumor cells, but not in corresponding benign epithelia. They
investigated the relationship between HIP1 expression in primary
prostate cancer and clinical outcomes with tissue microarrays. HIP1
expression was significantly associated with prostate cancer progression
and metastasis. Conversely, primary prostate cancers lacking HIP1
expression consistently showed no progression after radical
prostatectomy. In addition, the expression of HIP1 was elevated in
prostate tumors from the transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer. At
the molecular level, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of HIP1
led to caspase-9 (602234)-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that HIP1 is a
cellular survival factor. Thus, HIP1 may play a role in tumorigenesis by
allowing the survival of precancerous or cancerous cells. HIP1 might
accomplish this via regulation of clathrin-mediated trafficking, a
fundamental cellular pathway that had not theretofore been associated
with tumorigenesis. HIP1 represents a putative prognostic factor for
prostate cancer and a potential therapy target in prostate as well as
colon cancers.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; see 607785)
with a t(5;7)(q33;q11.2) translocation, Ross et al. (1998) found fusion
of the HIP1 gene to the platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor
gene (PDGFRB; 173410). They identified a chimeric transcript containing
the HIP1 gene located at 7q11.2 fused to the PDGFRB gene on 5q33. The
fusion gene encoded amino acids 1 to 950 of HIP1 joined in-frame to the
transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the PDGFRB gene. The
reciprocal PDGFRB/HIP1 transcript was not expressed. The fusion protein
product was a 180-kD protein when expressed in a murine hematopoietic
cell line and was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. Furthermore,
the fusion gene transformed the same mouse hematopoietic cell line to
interleukin-3-independent growth.

ANIMAL MODEL

Metzler et al. (2003) found that Hip1-null mice showed failure to thrive
and developed a neurologic phenotype by 3 months of age manifest as
tremor and gait ataxia secondary to a rigid thoracolumbar kyphosis. The
phenotype was progressive, resulting in premature death. The defect did
not result from anomalies of the skeleton, muscle, or neuromuscular
junction, and there were no morphologic changes in the central nervous
system. Liposomal membranes isolated from mutant mouse brains showed
decreased assembly of endocytic protein complexes, likely resulting in
impaired clathrin vesicle formation. Primary neurons from wildtype mice
showed Hip1 immunostaining in dendrites and cell bodies, suggesting Hip1
involvement in postsynaptic endocytic events. Following AMPA
stimulation, Hip1 colocalized with GluR1 (138248)-containing AMPA
receptors and became concentrated in cell bodies, indicating its role in
receptor trafficking. Neurons from the Hip1-null mice showed
significantly impaired clathrin-mediated internalization of
GluR1-containing AMPA receptors. The findings indicated that HIP1
regulates AMPA receptor trafficking in the central nervous system via
its function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Oravecz-Wilson et al. (2004) reported that 3 different mutations of
murine Hip1 lead to hematopoietic abnormalities, reflected by diminished
early progenitor frequencies and resistance to 5-FU-induced bone marrow
toxicity. Two of the Hip1 mutant lines also displayed the spinal
defects, including kypholordosis, described by Metzler et al. (2003).
The authors concluded that, in addition to being required for the
survival/proliferation of cancer cells and germline progenitors, HIP1 is
also required for the survival/proliferation of diverse types of somatic
cells, including hematopoietic progenitors.

Bradley et al. (2007) found that Hip1/Hip1r (605613) double-knockout
mice were dwarfed, had severe vertebral defects, and died in early
adulthood. However, these phenotypes were not observed in single Hip1-
or Hip1r-null mice, suggesting that the 2 genes can compensate for one
another. Studies did not show abnormalities in endocrine function or
growth factor receptors. Embryonic fibroblasts from Hip1/Hip1r
double-knockout mice showed delayed growth and delayed progression
through the cell cycle, but no increase in apoptosis. Expression of
human HIP1 rescued many aspects of the double-knockout phenotype,
suggesting that the human and mouse proteins share some functions.

Komoike et al. (2010) identified and cloned the zebrafish Hip1 gene.
Knockdown of the gene resulted in absence of yolk extension, a narrow
body along the dorsoventral axis, and mandibular hypoplasia, but no
other significant abnormalities were noted.

610578	TITLE *610578 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 15; ARHGAP15
;;BM046
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RHO GTPases (see ARHA; 165390) regulate diverse biologic processes, and
their activity is regulated by RHO GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs),
such as ARHGAP15 (Seoh et al., 2003).

CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of an available EST, Seoh et al.
(2003) cloned the coding region of ARHGAP15. The deduced 475-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a
C-terminal GAP domain, which is highly similar to the GAP domains of
ARHGAP9 (610576) and ARHGAP12 (610577). Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.7-kb transcript in spleen, lung, liver, and a myeloid leukemia cell
line. A 1.4-kb transcript was detected in skeletal muscle, and a 3-kb
transcript was detected in thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Seoh et al. (2003) found that the GAP domain of ARHGAP15 showed
specificity toward RAC1 (602048) in vitro. The PH domain was required
for ARHGAP15 to localize to the cell periphery. In COS-7 and HeLa cells,
overexpression of the full-length protein but not of the PH
domain-truncated mutant resulted in an increase in actin stress fibers
and cell contraction. These morphologic effects were attenuated by
coexpression of a dominant-negative RAC1 mutant. HeLa cells expressing
ARHGAP15 were also resistant to phorbol ester treatment, suggesting that
ARHGAP15 is a regulator of RAC1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
ARHGAP15 gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-64284).

604470	TITLE *604470 CD2 ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CD2BP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human CD2 (186990) facilitates both adhesion and activation of T
lymphocytes on binding to its ligand CD58 (LFA3; 153420). This binding
augments interleukin-12 (IL12; see 161560)-driven T-cell responsiveness.
By use of interaction trap cloning with the yeast 2-hybrid system and
5-prime RACE PCR, Nishizawa et al. (1998) identified a T-cell line cDNA
encoding a 341-amino acid protein, termed CD2BP2, that interacts with
the cytoplasmic tail of CD2. The authors noted that a segment near the C
terminus contains a consensus site for tyrosine phosphorylation. RNA
blot analysis indicated that CD2BP2 is expressed in a wide variety of
organs as approximately 1.35- and 4-kb transcripts. Immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that CD2BP2 expressed in J77 Jurkat and COS-7 cells
associates specifically with CD2. Mutation analysis suggested that a
21-amino acid motif is critical for CD2 binding and that 2 PPPGHR
sequences within the CD2 cytoplasmic tail mediate the binding to CD2BP2.
Additional transfection studies showed that CD2BP2 expression
selectively enhances IL2 (147680) production on crosslinking of CD2.

607515	TITLE *607515 PLACENTA-SPECIFIC GENE 8; PLAC8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By subtractive hybridization, Rissoan et al. (2002) identified PLAC8,
which they designated C15, as 1 of several transcripts expressed at high
levels in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The deduced 115-amino acid
protein contains a cleavable 23-amino acid signal peptide and no
transmembrane domain. PLAC8 shares 83% homology with mouse Plac8, which
contains 112 amino acids. The human sequence conserves 15 of the 16
cysteine residues found in the mouse protein. RT-PCR detected PLAC8
expression in all leukocyte populations tested, with weaker expression
in monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Northern blot analysis detected a
major transcript of 0.7 kb and minor transcripts of 4.4 and 7 kb in
organs of the immune system. High expression was found in spleen, lymph
nodes, peripheral blood leukocytes, and bone marrow, with lower
expression in thymus, appendix, and fetal liver.

By Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues, Galaviz-Hernandez et al.
(2003) detected strong expression of Plac8 in placenta at 9.5 days
postcoitum (dpc) through 18.5 dpc. In situ hybridization showed
expression limited to trophoblast giant cells at 6.5 and 8.5 dpc and to
the derived spongiotrophoblast layer at 10.5 and 18.5 dpc.

GENE FUNCTION

Rissoan et al. (2002) showed that PLAC8 expression was downregulated
upon activation, particularly in dendritic cells generated in vitro from
CD34 (142230) progenitor cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rissoan et al. (2002) determined that the PLAC8 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By homology to a BAC clone, Rissoan et al. (2002) mapped the PLAC8 gene
to chromosome 4q13-q21.

By database analysis, Galaviz-Hernandez et al. (2003) mapped the PLAC8
gene to chromosome 4q21 and the mouse Plac8 gene to chromosome 5E3.

611502	TITLE *611502 CENTROMERIC PROTEIN K; CENPK
;;SOLT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CENPK is a subunit of a CENPH (605607)-CENPI (300065)-associated
centromeric complex that targets CENPA (117139) to centromeres and is
required for proper kinetochore function and mitotic progression (Okada
et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using the chicken Cenpk sequence, Okada et al. (2006) cloned human CENPK
from a HeLa cell cDNA library (Fukagawa, 2007). The deduced protein
contains 269 amino acids and has an apparent molecular mass of 31.7 kD
by SDS-PAGE.

Yamashita et al. (2000) cloned mouse Cenpk, which they called Solt. The
deduced 306-amino acid protein contains 2 putative leucine zippers.
Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected Solt only in testis.
Immunofluorescence analysis detected Solt in the nuclei of transfected
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a promoter containing a synthetic cis element that bound the HMG
box of Sox6 (607257), Yamashita et al. (2000) found that mouse Solt was
a poor transcriptional enhancer. However, coexpression of both Solt and
a constitutively active form of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase IV (CAMK4; 114080) significantly enhanced reporter gene
expression. Yamashita et al. (2000) concluded that phosphorylation of
the HMG box of Sox5 may facilitate its interaction with Solt.

Using antibodies directed against CENPH and CENPI for
immunoprecipitations of HeLa cell lysates, Okada et al. (2006) found
that CENPK was one of several kinetochore components. CENPK
constitutively localized to centromeres throughout the cell cycle.
Chicken B cells expressing a conditional Cenpk deletion died upon
activation of the deletion. Cenpk deletion led to loss of centromeric
localization of Cenph, Cenpi, and Cenpl (611503), and while preexisting
Cenpa was stable, incorporation of newly synthesized Cenpa into
centromeres appeared defective in mutant cells. Knockdown of CENPK by
small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HeLa cells resulted in accumulation of
abnormal mitotic cells in G2-M phase.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CENPK
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP RH93623).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor is a member of a
subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) characterized by the
presence of a large N-terminal extracellular domain containing several
leucine-rich repeats (LRR). This glycoprotein hormone receptor family
has been named the LRR-containing GPCR (LGR) family (Ascoli et al.,
2002).

CLONING

McFarland et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA for the rat luteal
lutropin-choriogonadotropin receptor with the use of a DNA probe
generated in a PCR with oligonucleotide primers based on peptide
sequences of purified receptor protein. The sequence consisted of a
26-residue signal peptide, a 341-residue extracellular domain displaying
an internal repeat structure characteristic of members of the
leucine-rich glycoprotein family, and a 333-residue region containing 7
transmembrane segments. The membrane-spanning region displayed sequence
similarity with all members of the G protein-coupled receptor family.
Loosfelt et al. (1989) essentially confirmed these findings in the
porcine gene and made the additional discovery of variants which were
thought to have arisen through alternative splicing and in which the
putative transmembrane domain was absent.

Minegishi et al. (1990) isolated and cloned the human luteinizing
hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor from an ovary cDNA library. The
deduced protein contains 674 amino acids including a 335-amino acid
extracellular domain with 6 putative glycosylation sites, a 267-amino
acid region that displays 7 transmembrane segments (the serpentine
region), and a 72-amino acid C-terminal intracellular domain. Minegishi
et al. (1990) found evidence of alternative splicing. The human LHCGR
membrane spanning domain shares 90% homology with the rat and porcine
LHCGR receptors and approximately 70% with the human TSH (603372) and
FSH (136435) receptors.

Tsai-Morris et al. (1998) isolated a human LHCGR gene from a human
placenta genomic library and found that it differed in protein sequence
and start site from the reported ovarian LHCGR. Although Tsai-Morris et
al. (1998) thought they these represented 2 different LHCGR genes, it
was later determined that the sequence identified by Tsai-Morris et al.
(1998) was an LHCGR variant (152790.0017) (Ascoli et al., 2002).

(1993) and Ascoli et al. (2002).

MAPPING

Rousseau-Merck et al. (1990) assigned the LHCGR gene to chromosome 2p21.

GENE STRUCTURE

The LHCGR gene contains 11 exons and spans approximately 80 kb (Atger et
al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

Gospodarowicz (1973), Lee and Ryan (1972), and others studied receptors
for human luteinizing hormone in testis and ovary.

In the ovary, theca, stromal, late-stage (luteinizing) granulosa, and
luteal cells contain LHCGR. In the testes, Leydig cells contain LHCGR
(Themmen and Huhtaniemi, 2000).

Eblen et al. (2001) tested the hypothesis that human ejaculated sperm
contain functional LHCG receptors. Their data indicated that LHCGR mRNA
and protein that can bind CG are present. The receptors were functional,
as indicated by an increase in cAMP levels and activation of sperm
protein kinase A (see 176911) following treatment with CG or LH.
However, treatment with these hormones had no effect on sperm protein
kinase C (see 176960) activity. The authors concluded that since
functional LHCGRs are found in human sperm, it is important to determine
whether CG treatment could improve the outcome of infertility
procedures.

Min and Ascoli (2000) examined the effects of several LHCGR mutations on
the phosphorylation, internalization, and turnover of the cell surface
receptor. Three gain-of-function mutations associated with Leydig cell
hyperplasia, including 1 somatic mutation associated with Leydig cell
adenomas (D578H; 152790.0019), were chosen for this study. One
signaling-impaired mutation associated with Leydig cell hypoplasia
(I625K; 152790.0016) and 2 laboratory-designed signaling-impaired
mutations were also used. The signaling-impaired mutations showed a
reduction in human CG-induced receptor phosphorylation and
internalization. Mutation of the phosphorylation sites of these
loss-of-function mutants had little or no additional effect on
internalization. Cotransfection with G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2
(GRK2: 109635) rescued the CG-induced phosphorylation and
internalization of the signaling-impaired mutations but only if the
phosphorylation sites were intact. Overexpression of arrestin-3 (301770)
rescued the rate of internalization regardless of whether or not the
phosphorylation sites were intact. The authors concluded that the data
obtained with the signaling-impaired and phosphorylation-deficient
mutants of the LHCGR support a model whereby receptor phosphorylation
and activation play a redundant role in the internalization of CG. The
results obtained with the constitutively active mutants suggest that,
when occupied by CG, these mutants assume a conformation that bypasses
many of the steps involved in internalization.

Before ovulation in mammals, a cascade of events resembling an
inflammatory and/or tissue remodeling process is triggered by LH in the
ovarian follicle. Many LH effects, however, are thought to be indirect
because of the restricted expression of its receptor to mural granulosa
cells (Peng et al., 1991). Park et al. (2004) demonstrated that LH
stimulation in wildtype mouse ovaries induces the transient and
sequential expression of the epidermal growth factor family members
amphiregulin (104640), epiregulin (602061), and betacellulin (600345).
Incubation of follicles with these growth factors recapitulates the
morphologic and biochemical events triggered by LH, including cumulus
expansion and oocyte maturation. Thus, Park et al. (2004) concluded that
these EGF-related growth factors are paracrine mediators that propagate
the LH signal throughout the follicle.

Loss-of-function mutations in the LHCGR gene in males cause Leydig cell
hypoplasia, supporting the concept that a functional receptor is
necessary for the early development of Leydig cells. Activating
mutations of the receptor cause gonadotropin-independent male-limited
precocious puberty, a disorder characterized by autonomous hyperplasia
and hyperfunction of Leydig cells in association with inappropriate
stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and the cAMP signaling pathway, but
little or no activation of the phospholipase C pathway.

To investigate the role of exon 10 in LHCGR action in vitro, Muller et
al. (2003) created stable COS-7 cells expressing the LHR with or without
exon 10 (see also 152790.0020). Binding experiments showed that the
affinities of LH and CG to LHR with and without exon 10 were similar.
The authors concluded that although exon 10 of the LHR plays no role in
ligand binding, it is important for receptor activation by LH by a
mechanism probably involving extracellular conformational changes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Atger et al. (1995) described a leu-gln (LQ) insertion at position 55-60
of the LHCGR. They noted that the extracellular N-terminal domain of
glycoprotein hormone receptors constitutes the high-affinity binding
site responsible for the specificity in hormone recognition, suggesting
that variations in the reported N-terminal sequences could have
functional significance. Rodien et al. (1998) demonstrated that both
sequences exist as allelic variants in the Caucasian population
(152790.0017). In contrast, the LQ allele is virtually absent from the
Japanese population.

- Male-Limited Precocious Puberty

Laue et al. (1995) studied the constitutively activating mutations of
the LHCGR gene in dominantly inherited male-limited precocious puberty
(176410). They studied genomic DNA from 32 unrelated families. The
inherited form of the disorder was present in 28, and of these, 24 were
found to have an asp578-to-gly mutation (152790.0001). Other mutations
were found, suggesting that the region spanning nucleotides 1624-1741 of
exon 11 is a hotspot for point mutations that constitutively activate
the LHCGR gene and cause male-limited precocious puberty.

Multiple activating mutations in the sixth transmembrane domain of the
LHCGR have been identified in patients with male-limited precocious
puberty. By computer analysis, Yano et al. (1997) found that these
mutations have an effect on the secondary structure of the third
cytoplasmic loop and sixth transmembrane domain. They also found that
phe576, which might be important for receptor activity, is a critical
conformational bridging residue between these 2 regions. To analyze the
functional role of phe576, the authors made 4 amino acid substitutions,
F576I, F576G, F576Y, and F576E, in the LHCGR. Computer analysis of the
F576E mutant predicted that its secondary structure changed to a totally
helical conformation in the region of the third intracellular and sixth
transmembrane domain. In contrast, the secondary structures of the
F576G, F576I, and F576Y mutants were predicted to change the helical
conformation in the region to an extended conformation. In expression
studies, mutations of phe576 produced functional changes in cAMP and
inositol phosphate (IP) signaling and CG binding. Mutations predicted to
cause an extended conformation exhibited 2 functional patterns: first,
constitutively activating in cAMP signaling without changes in IP
signaling or CG binding (F576I and F576G), and second, constitutively
activating in cAMP signaling with decreased CG-induced cAMP and IP
signaling and with both higher affinity and lower capacity of CG binding
(F576Y). The mutation predicted to cause a totally helical conformation
resulted in no cAMP responses and a minimal IP response to CG
stimulation, with negligible CG binding (F576E). Yano et al. (1997)
concluded that phe576 plays an important role in the human LHCGR with
respect to receptor conformation, Gs coupling, and cAMP signaling
consistent with predictions from mutations associated with male-limited
precocious puberty.

Kremer et al. (1999) reported analysis of LHCGR gene mutations in a
sample consisting of 17 independent families and sporadic cases (8
familial and 9 with a negative family history) with LH-independent
precocious puberty. They detected 7 different mutations in 12 patients.
Of these, 2 mutations were detected more than once. The ile542-to-leu
mutation (152790.0018) was present in 4 Dutch kindreds, suggesting a
common ancestor, although no genealogic relationship could be
demonstrated. The met398-to-thr mutation (152790.0010) was found in 2
kindreds from Germany and in 1 patient from Sicily. In contrast to
previous reports, the asp578-to-gly mutation (152790.0001) was not
frequent in these 17 kindreds. In fact, none of the 10 European kindreds
with LHCGR mutations in this study had the asp578-to-gly mutation, and
the only family with this mutation was from the U.S. The authors
suggested that there is a strong founder effect in the U.S., where
greater than 90% of testotoxicosis families have the asp578-to-gly
mutation. Only 12 LHCGR gene mutations had been reported in a total of
68 independent patients and families. The restricted number of LHCGR
mutations found in affected kindreds as well as in sporadic cases
strongly suggested that only mutations in specific areas of the
receptor, in particular the sixth transmembrane region, can autonomously
activate cAMP production.

- Leydig Cell Hypoplasia

In 46,XY sibs with pseudohermaphroditism, offspring of consanguineous
parents, who presented with female external genitalia, primary
amenorrhea, and lack of breast development (238320), Kremer et al.
(1995) identified homozygosity for an ala593-to-pro mutation in the LCGR
gene (152790.0004).

Laue et al. (1995) demonstrated a nonsense mutation in the LCGR gene
(152790.0007) in 2 46,XY sisters with Leydig cell hypoplasia, a form of
male pseudohermaphroditism. The affected sibs were presumably compound
heterozygotes. The father had the same mutation; the mother was presumed
to have a different loss of function mutation which was not detected. In
the family reported by Laue et al. (1995), Wu et al. (1998) identified a
loss of function mutation in the mother (152790.0021). Genomic DNA-PCR
showed that this defective maternal LHCGR allele was inherited by the 2
affected children, but RT-PCR showed that the maternal allele was not
expressed. They concluded that Leydig cell hypoplasia in this family was
the result of compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the
LHCGR gene.

Latronico et al. (1998) reported a 46,XY pseudohermaphrodite who
presented with female external genitalia and his 46,XX sister who had
oligoamenorrhea and infertility, and enlarged cystic ovaries. Both sibs
were found to be homozygous for a deletion at nucleotides 1822-1827
(CTGGTT), resulting in the deletion of leu608 (CTG) and val609 (GTT) in
the seventh transmembrane helix of the LHCGR gene (152790.0015).
Transfections of 293 cells with normal and mutant LHCGR constructs
showed that very little of the mutant receptor was expressed at the cell
surface. This was due to both a decrease in the total amount of receptor
expressed as well as increased intracellular retention of the mutant
receptor. While equilibrium binding assays showed that the cell surface
mutant receptor bound CG with an affinity comparable to that of the
wildtype receptor, cells expressing the mutant exhibited only a 1.5- to
2.4-fold stimulation of cAMP production in response to CG. In contrast,
cells expressing comparably low levels of the normal receptor responded
to CG with 11- to 30-fold increases of cAMP levels. Latronico et al.
(1998) concluded that the majority of the mutant receptor is retained
intracellularly, and that the small percentage of mutant receptor that
is expressed at the cell surface binds hormone normally but is unable to
activate the stimulatory G protein (Gs; see 139320).

- Luteinizing Hormone Resistance, Female

Latronico et al. (1998) identified the same mutation in the LHCGR gene
(152790.0015) in a 46,XX girl with oligomenorrhea and infertility (see
238320) and her 46,XY sib with Leydig cell hypoplasia and
pseudohermaproditism.

Toledo et al. (1996) evaluated a 46,XX sister of the two 46,XY male
pseudohermaphrodites with Leydig cell hypoplasia described by Kremer et
al. (1995). They found that the patient, who presented with amenorrhea
due to hypergonadotropic hypogonadism but with structurally normal
ovaries, had the same mutation in the LHCGR gene (152790.0004) as her 2
affected sibs.

- Leydig Cell Adenomas

Leydig cell adenomas are the most frequent form of hormone-producing
tumors of the testis and account for 1 to 3% of all testicular tumors.
Most are benign, but 10% of tumors in adults are malignant. Boys with
Leydig cell tumors typically have signs of isosexual precocity as a
result of testosterone secretion by the tumor. The demonstrated role of
the luteinizing hormone receptor in the proliferation of Leydig cells
and the presence of germline and somatic mutations in the gene for the
homologous thyrotropin receptor (TSHR; 603372) in familial
nonimmunogenic hyperthyroidism (e.g., 603372.0004) and sporadic thyroid
adenomas (e.g., 603372.0002), respectively, led Liu et al. (1999) to
hypothesize that some Leydig cell adenomas are caused by activating
somatic mutations in the LHCGR gene. Indeed, they described 3 boys with
isosexual precocity presenting as early pubertal development 1 to 2
years before the discovery of Leydig cell tumors. All 3 were found to be
heterozygous for a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 1732 (1732G-C) in
the tumor only. This novel somatic mutation, resulting in the change of
GAT to CAT, encoded an asp578-to-his amino acid change (152790.0019). In
2 unrelated boys with gonadotropin-independent hypersecretion of
testosterone due to Leydig cell adenomas, Canto et al. (2002) found the
same 1732G-C heterozygous mutation in DNA from the tumors from both
patients, but not from the adjacent normal tissue or blood leukocytes.
Sequencing of the LHCGR gene showed that 50 normal individuals did not
have this mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, ASP578GLY

In individuals with familial male precocious puberty (FMPP; 176410) from
8 different families, Shenker et al. (1993) identified heterozygosity
for a single A-to-G transition that resulted in substitution of glycine
for aspartate at position 578 (D578G) in the sixth transmembrane helix
of the LH receptor. Linkage of the mutation to the clinical disorder was
supported by restriction-digest analysis. COS-7 cells expressing the
mutant LH receptor exhibited markedly increased cyclic AMP production in
the absence of agonist, suggesting that autonomous Leydig cell activity
in this disorder is caused by a constitutively activated LH receptor.

Kosugi et al. (1995) stated that the asp578-to-gly mutation had been
found in affected males from 9 American FMPP families. Since 7 of the 9
originated in the southeastern United States, the possibility of a
shared common ancestor was raised. For that reason, they analyzed
genomic DNA from affected males from 6 new FMPP families: 2 from
Germany, 3 from France, and 1 from the western United States with mixed
Caucasian-Native American ancestry. None of the 6 new samples contained
the asp578-to-gly mutation, as indicated by the absence of digestion
with MspI. PCR products were then screened for heterozygous mutations by
temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments from 2 of the
patients migrated abnormally. Direct sequencing of the PCR product from
1 affected German male revealed a heterozygous mutation of the type
described in another European family by Kremer et al. (1993); see
152790.0002.

In a screening of genomic DNA from 32 unrelated families with
male-limited precocious puberty, Laue et al. (1995) found that 28 had
the inherited form of the disorder, and of these, 24 had the D578G
mutation. Four additional mutations were found among the remaining 4
families with the inherited form and in 4 sporadic cases of the
disorder.

Kawate et al. (1995) found this same constitutively activating mutation
of the LHCGR gene in a family with male-limited gonadotropin-independent
precocious puberty (testotoxicosis). The family was ascertained through
2 affected brothers whose father had started puberty before his third
birthday. His maternal uncle and maternal great uncle were also
affected.

Yano et al. (1994) found the asp578-to-gly mutation in a sporadic case
of male precocious puberty in a Japanese patient.

Martin et al. (1998) reported a 35-year-old man, previously diagnosed
with familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP) and in whom
heterozygosity for the dominant gain-of-function D578G mutation in the
LHCGR gene was identified, who was subsequently found to have a
testicular seminoma. The authors stated that this represented the first
case of a testicular germ cell tumor described in an FMPP patient.

.0002
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, MET575ILE

Kremer et al. (1993) hypothesized that an abnormal configuration of the
LH receptor might autonomously activate G protein coupling, and thereby
cause the overproduction of testosterone in the absence of testicular
stimulation by luteinizing hormone observed in familial male precocious
puberty (176410). Therefore, they screened for mutations in a part of
the LHCGR gene that is important for G protein binding, using the
single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. DNA sequence
variation was detected in 2 out of 5 families, and in each case the
mutation cosegregated with the disorder (lod score 5.76 without
recombination). Both mutations caused an amino acid substitution in the
sixth transmembrane domain, close to the C-terminal portion of the third
cytoplasmic loop, a region important for the binding of G proteins: a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1725 in family 1 and an A-to-G
transition at nucleotide 1745 in family 2. In family 1, a change at
codon 575 from ATG to ATA led to replacement of methionine by
isoleucine; in family 2, a change at codon 582 resulted in substitution
of glycine for aspartic acid.

In a German male with FMPP, Kosugi et al. (1995) found the same
mutation, ATG to ATA, which, however, in their numbering system, was
indicated as encoding MET571ILE. By transiently expressing the
met571-to-ile mutation in COS-7 cells, they found that agonist affinity
was unaffected by the mutation. However, like the asp578-to-gly mutant
receptor, the met571-to-ile receptor triggered agonist-independent
production of cAMP, but not of inositol phosphates. This suggested that
autonomous testosterone production in FMPP can be explained by
constitutive activation of the cAMP pathway alone.

LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LUTEINIZING HORMONE RESISTANCE, FEMALE, INCLUDED
LHCGR, ALA593PRO

In two 46,XY sibs with Leydig cell hypoplasia (238320) born to
consanguineous parents, Kremer et al. (1995) found homozygosity for a
missense ala593-to-pro mutation in the sixth transmembrane domain of the
LHCGR gene. In vitro expression studies showed that this mutated
receptor binds human choriogonadotropin normally, but the ligand binding
does not result in increased production of cAMP. They concluded that a
homozygous LH receptor gene mutation underlies the syndrome of autosomal
recessive congenital Leydig cell hypoplasia in this family. The 2 sibs
had presented with female external genitalia, primary amenorrhea, and
lack of breast development. Their parents, who were first cousins, had
14 additional offspring. Both patients had short blind-ending vagina,
without uterus or fallopian tubes. Sperm levels of testosterone and
testosterone precursors were abnormally low and did not respond to
stimulation with human choriogonadotropin. Basal levels of luteinizing
hormone were markedly increased. On histologic examination, the gonads
were found to be testes with normal Sertoli cells but no mature Leydig
cells.

Toledo et al. (1996) evaluated a 46,XX sister of the two 46,XY male
pseudohermaphrodites with Leydig cell hypoplasia described by Kremer et
al. (1995). The patient presented with amenorrhea due to
hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (see 238320), but had structurally normal
ovaries. Analysis of her LH receptor genes showed that she was
homozygous for the same mutation that caused an ala593-to-pro
substitution in her 2 brothers. In vitro analysis of the mutant LH
receptor in cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells showed that the
receptor is unable to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in response to CG.
These results document the existence of inherited LH resistance as a
cause of primary amenorrhea in women.

.0005
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, THR577ILE

In a male with familial precocious puberty (176410), Kosugi et al.
(1995) demonstrated a thr577-to-ile mutation (ACC to ATT).

.0006
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, ALA572VAL

In 2 Japanese patients with male-limited precocious puberty (176410)
without a family history of the disorder, Yano et al. (1995) found a
heterozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1715 leading to an
alanine-to-valine substitution in codon 572 of transmembrane helix 6.
Transfected into COS-7 cells, the A572V mutation exhibited
constitutively high basal cAMP levels. Yano et al. (1995) concluded that
the constitutively higher cAMP levels led to Leydig cell activation. The
mother of 1 of the 2 patients had the same heterozygous mutation.

.0007
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LHCGR, CYS545TER

Laue et al. (1995) identified a cys545-to-ter mutation in exon 11 of the
LHCGR gene in 2 46,XY sibs with male pseudohermaphroditism (238320). The
mutation was an A-to-C transversion at nucleotide 1635 which caused loss
of function of the receptor by introducing a stop codon at residue 545
in transmembrane helix 5 of the luteinizing hormone receptor. Surface
expression of the truncated gene product in human embryonic kidney cells
stably transfected with cDNA encoding the mutant protein was diminished
compared to the wildtype gene, and hCG-induced cAMP accumulation was
impaired. The mutation in the 2 sibs was present also in the normal
father and was not present in the mother. The finding excludes the
possibility of a dominant-negative mutation in the sisters and suggests
that they are compound heterozygotes, the mutation inherited from the
mother not being identified. The results of Laue et al. (1995) indicated
that functional domains between transmembrane helix 5 and the C-terminal
cytoplasmic tail of the gene are required for normal cell surface
expression of the receptor and signal transduction. In the family
reported by Laue et al. (1995), Wu et al. (1998) identified a loss of
function mutation in the mother (152790.0021).

.0008
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LUTEINIZING HORMONE RESISTANCE, FEMALE, INCLUDED
LHCGR, ARG554TER

In a sibship with 14 children, Latronico et al. (1996) identified 3
brothers with pseudohermaphroditism with Leydig cell hypoplasia (238320)
and 1 sister with partial ovarian failure (see 238320). In all 4 sibs,
they identified a homozygous substitution of thymine for cytosine at
nucleotide 1660 of the LHCGR gene; the mutation changed codon 554 from
one coding for arginine (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA) within the third
cytosolic loop of the LH receptor. The sister had spontaneous gonadarche
at the age of 13 years, and she had a single episode of vaginal bleeding
at the age of 20 years. Her height and weight were normal, pubic-hair
development was Tanner stage 5, and the breasts and external genitalia
were those of a normal woman. Her karyotype was 46,XX. Serum LH
concentration was very high and serum estradiol concentration and
progesterone concentration were low.

LEYDIG HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LHCGR, SER616TYR

In a 6-year-old phenotypically male child who had been referred as a
neonate for evaluation of micropenis (see 238320), Latronico et al.
(1996) identified a C-to-A transversion of nucleotide 1847 of the
LH-receptor cDNA, resulting in a change of codon 616 from one coding for
serine (TCT) to one coding for tyrosine (TAT) within the seventh
transmembrane region of the LH receptor. At birth, the length of the
stretched phallus was 1.5 cm (more than 2.5 SD below the normal mean for
age). Both testes were descended, with a volume of approximately 1 ml
each.

PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, MET398THR

Several affected members of a family with familial male precocious
puberty (176410) and 1 affected subject in a second family showed a
point mutation (T-to-C transition at nucleotide 1192), resulting in a
met398-to-thr substitution in the second transmembrane domain of the LH
receptor protein (Evans et al., 1996). In addition, 1 male in the first
family had the mutation but showed no evidence of precocious puberty.
All obligate carriers within this family were shown to have the
mutation, and it was not detected in 94 chromosomes from unaffected and
unrelated white subjects. In the second family, the index case was the
only one to have the mutation.

.0011
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, ASP578GLY

The pituitary-gonadal axis was evaluated by Rosenthal et al. (1996) in a
mother after 2 of her sons with familial male-limited precocious puberty
(176410) were found to have a constitutively activating mutation of the
LHCGR gene. All 3 were heterozygous for an asp578-to-gly substitution in
the sixth transmembrane segment of LHCGR. Ovarian function was normal in
the 36-year-old mother as assessed by LH dynamics as well as FSH and
androgen levels throughout her menstrual cycle. Hormonal responses to
acute GnRH agonist (nafarelin) challenge, chronic GnRH agonist
administration, and dexamethasone were also normal. Studies of the
affected sons on presentation at 2.4 and 3.5 years of age revealed that
acute LH responses to nafarelin were in the hypogonadotropic range, and
the FSH responses were prepubertal despite the presence of late pubertal
testosterone blood levels. These data showed that the activating
asp578-to-gly LHCGR mutation does not cause functional ovarian
hyperandrogenism but only incomplete pubertal activation of Leydig cells
consistent with the relatively low constitutive activity of this
mutation.

LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE II
LHCGR, ARG133CYS

Misrahi et al. (1997) reported the case of an infant who presented at
birth with hypoplastic phallus associated with hypospadias (see 238320).
Conventional microscopic study of the testes showed fibroblastic cells
in the interstitium. However, immunocytochemical analysis using anti-LH
receptor and anti-P450c17 antibodies demonstrated that about one-third
of these cells were Leydig cells or their precursors. The infant was
homozygous for an arg133-to-cys substitution in the extracellular domain
of LHCGR. COS-7 cells transfected with the mutant receptor showed a
marked impairment of CG binding, but exhibited some cAMP production at
high CG concentrations. The authors proposed that the partial impairment
of LHCGR function, as reflected by the presence of Leydig cells, was
responsible for the milder LCH phenotype observed.

.0013
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, ALA373VAL

Gromoll et al. (1998) reported a patient with onset of puberty at the
age of 5 years, who had accelerated growth, enlargement of genitalia,
pubarche, and serum hormone levels compatible with noncentral precocious
puberty (176410). They identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition at
nucleotide position 1126, encoding an ala373-to-val substitution in the
first transmembrane domain. The LHCGR sequences of the parents were
normal. The mutated receptor displayed an increase in basal cAMP
production (up to 7.5-fold) compared to that of the wildtype receptor in
transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Treatment of the patient with
ketoconazole resulted in inconsistent suppression of serum testosterone
levels. At the age of 9.1 years, central activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis occurred. Additional treatment with
a GnRH agonist led to complete suppression of testosterone secretion.

.0014
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LUTEINIZING HORMONE RESISTANCE, FEMALE, INCLUDED
LHCGR, GLU354LYS

Stavrou et al. (1998) reported a homozygous mutation of the LHCGR gene
in 3 sibs (two 46,XY and one 46,XX). The 46,XY sibs presented with
female external genitalia, primary amenorrhea, and lack of breast
development (238320). Hormonal evaluation revealed a markedly elevated
LH level with a low testosterone level, which failed to increase after
human CG stimulation. Histologic analysis of the inguinal gonads in a
46,XY sib revealed no Leydig cells, but Sertoli cells, spermatogonia,
and primary spermatocytes were seen. The 46,XX sib had female external
genitalia, normal breast development, cystic ovaries, and primary
amenorrhea (see 238320). Hormonal analyses showed markedly elevated LH
levels and low plasma 17-beta-estradiol levels. A homozygous missense
mutation was found at exon 11 of the LHCGR gene. Guanine was replaced by
adenine (GAA to AAA), resulting in a substitution of lysine for glutamic
acid at amino acid position 354. Functional analysis of the mutation
showed complete loss of function, indicated by the lack of cAMP
production after human CG stimulation in transfected human embryonic
kidney 293 cells. Screening of family members demonstrated
heterozygosity for the mutation, indicating autosomal recessive
inheritance.

.0015
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LUTEINIZING HORMONE RESISTANCE, FEMALE, INCLUDED
LHCGR, 6-BP DEL, NT1822

Latronico et al. (1998) reported a 46,XY pseudohermaphrodite who
presented with female external genitalia (238320) and his 46,XX sister
who had oligoamenorrhea and infertility, and enlarged cystic ovaries
(see 238320). Both affected sibs were homozygous for a deletion of
nucleotides 1822-1827 (CTGGTT), resulting in the deletion of leu608
(CTG) and val609 (GTT) in the seventh transmembrane helix of the LHCGR
gene. This microdeletion caused impaired expression and reduced signal
transduction activity of the LHCGR.

.0016
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE II
LHCGR, ILE625LYS

Martens et al. (1998) evaluated 3 brothers with Leydig cell hypoplasia
who presented with micropenis, absence of pubertal signs, and
infertility (see 238320). LH and FSH levels were elevated but responded
normally to GnRH. Basal testosterone and androstenedione levels,
however, were low and responded poorly to CG. Analysis of their LHCGR
genes revealed a homozygous missense mutation resulting in an
iso625-to-lys (I625K) substitution. In vitro analysis of the I625K
mutant in HEK293 cells indicated that the signaling efficiency was
significantly impaired, explaining the partial phenotype. The authors
compared this mutant to 2 other LHCGR gene mutations, A593P
(152790.0004) and S616Y (152790.0009). Although the ligand-binding
affinity for all 3 mutant receptors was normal, the hormonal response of
A593P was completely absent and that of S616Y and I625K was severely
impaired. Low cell surface expression explained the reduced response of
S616Y, while a combination of low cell surface expression and decreased
coupling efficiency explained the diminished response of I625K. For
A593P, the absence of a reduced response resulted from both poor cell
surface expression and a complete deficiency in coupling. Martens et al.
(1998) concluded that a clear correlation exists between the severity of
the clinical phenotype of patients and overall receptor signal capacity,
which is a combination of cell surface expression and coupling
efficiency.

.0017
LUTEINIZING HORMONE/CHORIOGONADOTROPIN RECEPTOR, LQ VARIANT
LUTEINIZING HORMONE/CHORIOGONADOTROPIN RECEPTOR, LQ VARIANT, INCLUDED
LHCGR, LEU-GLN INS, CODON 19-20

Two different human LH receptor sequences have been published, differing
by a 6-basepair insertion encoding leu-gln at position 55-60 (Minegishi
et al., 1990; Atger et al., 1995). Rodien et al. (1998) demonstrated
that both sequences exist as allelic variants in the Caucasian
population. Allele frequencies of LQ variant and wildtype allele are
0.26 and 0.74 respectively. In contrast, the LQ allele is virtually
absent from the Japanese population. Functional characterization of both
alleles by transient expression in COS-7 cells did not reveal any
difference between the 2 receptors, neither for cell surface expression
nor for cAMP production and sensitivity to CG/LH.

Powell et al. (2003) investigated whether functional polymorphic
variants in the LH signaling pathway are associated with the risk of
breast cancer or its clinical phenotype. Women who were homozygous for
the LQ allele were, on average, 8.3 years younger at diagnosis, compared
with those homozygous for the wildtype LHR allele (mean age, 51.9 years
vs 60.2 years; P = 0.03). Trends were observed for associations between
LQ carriers and nodal involvement or larger tumor size. Patients who
were LQ carriers revealed a significantly worse overall survival,
compared with those who were homozygous for wildtype LHR. The authors
concluded that their findings suggested that the LQ gene polymorphism
determines an earlier age of disease onset and is prognostic for poor
outcome of breast cancer.

.0018
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, ILE542LEU

Kremer et al. (1999) found that an ile542-to-leu substitution was
present in 4 Dutch kindreds with male LH-independent precocious puberty
(176410), suggesting a common ancestor as the cause for this clustering,
although no genealogic relationship could be demonstrated. Laue et al.
(1995) had found this mutation in 3 families and in one sporadic case
from the U.S.

.0019
LEYDIG CELL ADENOMA, SOMATIC, WITH MALE-LIMITED PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY
LHCGR, ASP578HIS

Liu et al. (1999) described 3 boys with isosexual precocity (176410)
presenting as early pubertal development 1 to 2 years before the
discovery of Leydig cell tumors. All 3 were found to be heterozygous for
a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 1732 of the LHCGR gene in the tumor
only. This novel somatic mutation, resulting in the change of GAT to
CAT, encoded an asp578-to-his amino acid change.

In 2 unrelated boys with gonadotropin-independent hypersecretion of
testosterone due to Leydig cell adenomas, Canto et al. (2002) found the
same 1732G-C heterozygous mutation in DNA from the tumors from both
patients, but not from the adjacent normal tissue or blood leukocytes.
Sequencing of the LHCGR gene showed that 50 normal individuals did not
have this mutation.

.0020
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE II
LHCGR, EX10DEL

Gromoll et al. (2000) reported a patient with partial Leydig cell
hypoplasia (see 238320) caused by a genomic deletion resulting in the
complete absence of exon 10 of the LHCGR gene. The patient presented at
the age of 18 years with retarded pubertal development, small testicles,
and delayed bone maturation. LH was highly elevated, with very low serum
testosterone levels. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous deletion of
approximately 5 kb encompassing exon 10 of the LHCGR gene. Screening of
family members demonstrated heterozygosity for the deletion, indicating
autosomal recessive inheritance. At the time of examination, the patient
displayed nearly normal male phenotype but lacked pubertal development
and was hypogonadal. Fetal male development sustained by hCG was normal,
whereas LH action was impaired. An hCG stimulation test induced
testosterone biosynthesis and secretion within the normal range. The
authors concluded that despite highly elevated endogenous LH serum
levels, the response to hCG indicates a possible dual mechanism of
hormone binding and signal transduction for hCG and LH on an LHCGR
lacking exon 10. Furthermore, they stated that the patient represents
the clinical counterpart of the normal male marmoset monkey, in which
the expressed LHR lacks exon 10 in toto.

.0021
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LHCGR, 33-BP INS, NT54

In the family reported by Laue et al. (1995) in which 2 sibs with Leydig
cell hypoplasia type I (238320) inherited a cys545-to-ter mutation
(152790.0007) on the paternal allele, Wu et al. (1998) identified a
33-bp insertion in the maternal LHCGR allele. This insertion occurred
between nucleotides 54 and 55 and might be the result of a partial gene
duplication. Genomic DNA-PCR showed that this defective maternal LHCGR
allele was inherited by the 2 affected children, but RT-PCR showed that
the maternal allele was not expressed. They concluded that Leydig cell
hypoplasia in this family was the result of compound heterozygous
loss-of-function mutations of the LHCGR gene.

.0022
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, LEU368PRO

Latronico et al. (2000) examined 3 Brazilian boys, 2 brothers and 1
unrelated boy, with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty
(176410). Direct sequencing of the entire exon 11 of the LHCGR gene in
the 2 brothers showed a heterozygous substitution of T for C at
nucleotide 1103, resulting in the substitution of leu368 to pro (L368P)
in the first transmembrane helix. Cells expressing the novel L368P
mutation displayed up to a 12-fold increase in basal cAMP production
compared with cells expressing the same number of cell surface wildtype
LHCGR, indicating constitutive activation of the mutant receptor.

.0023
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, ALA568VAL

In a Brazilian boy with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty
(176410) examined by Latronico et al. (2000), sequencing of exon 11 of
the LHCGR gene revealed homozygosity for a nucleotide substitution
causing an ala568-to-val (A568V) substitution in the third cytoplasmic
loop of the receptor. This mutation had been found previously in 2
unrelated Brazilian boys in heterozygous state (Latronico et al., 1995,
1998). Clinical and hormonal data of the homozygous A568V patient were
not different from those of heterozygotes. The phenotype caused by
dominant activating mutations of the LHCGR gene is not altered when both
alleles carry a mutant sequence. The authors concluded that the A568V
mutation is the most frequent cause of male-limited precocious puberty
in Brazilian boys.

.0024
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, LEU457ARG

Latronico et al. (1998) examined 2 unrelated Brazilian boys with
gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (176410) caused by 2
different heterozygous activating mutations of LHCGR. Direct sequencing
of the entire exon 11 in one affected boy revealed a heterozygous
substitution of T for G at nucleotide 1370 that converted leu457 to arg
(L457R) in the third transmembrane helix of the LHCGR. His parents had a
normal LHCGR gene sequence, establishing the sporadic nature of this
mutation. Human embryonic 293 cells expressing mutant or wildtype LHCGR
bound CG with high affinity. However, cells expressing LHCGR 457R
exhibited significantly higher basal levels of cAMP (7- to 14-fold) than
cells expressing the wildtype receptor, indicating constitutive
activation. Furthermore, cells expressing the mutant were unresponsive
to further stimulation by CG. This finding was confirmed in the patient
by lack of an increase in serum testosterone after CG stimulation. The
authors concluded that the conformation of the L457R mutant represents a
different activated receptor state (R*) than the agonist-occupied
wildtype receptor. The other mutation identified was ala568 to val
(152790.0023).

.0025
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LHCGR, CYS343SER

Martens et al. (2002) reported the identification of 2 LHCGR mutations
in a compound heterozygous case of complete Leydig hypoplasia (238320)
and determined the cause of the signaling deficiency at a molecular
level. On the paternal allele of the patient they identified in codon
343 a T-to-A transversion that changes a conserved cysteine in the hinge
region of the receptor to serine (C343S); on the maternal allele a
T-to-C transition causes another conserved cysteine at codon 543 in
transmembrane segment 5 to be altered to arginine (C543R). Both of these
mutant receptors are completely devoid of hormone-induced cAMP reporter
gene activation. Using Western blotting of expressed LH receptor protein
with a hemagglutinin tag, they showed that despite complete absence of
total and cell surface hormone binding, protein levels of both mutant LH
receptors are only moderately affected. Expression and study of enhanced
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged receptors demonstrated that
although initial translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum of these
mutant receptors was normal, translocation was halted or misrouted, and
as a result, neither mutant ever reached the cell surface, and they
could not bind hormone. The authors concluded that complete lack of
signaling by the identified mutant LH receptors is caused by
insufficient processing from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell
surface and results in complete Leydig cell hypoplasia in this patient.

.0026
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LHCGR, CYS543ARG

See 152790.0025 and Martens et al. (2002).

.0027
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LHCGR, LEU502PRO

In a 19-year-old patient with female phenotype and 46,XY karyotype
(238320), Leung et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1505T-C
transversion in exon 11 of the LHCGR gene, resulting in a leu502-to-pro
(L502P) substitution at a conserved residue in the fourth transmembrane
helix of the protein. The mutation caused inactivation of the LH
receptor and resulted in Leydig cell hypoplasia. Testicular histology
and hormonal profile of the patient were considered typical for Leydig
cell hypoplasia. The mutation was present in heterozygous state in both
parents.

.0028
LEYDIG CELL HYPOPLASIA, TYPE I
LHCGR, VAL144PHE

In a patient with Leydig cell hypoplasia (238320) who presented as a
46,XY girl, Richter-Unruh et al. (2004) detected a G-to-T transversion
at nucleotide 430 in exon 5 of the LHCGR gene, resulting in an amino
acid change from valine to phenylalanine at codon 144 (V144F). The
father, mother, and one of the patient's brothers were heterozygous for
the mutation. Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with the mutant
LHCG receptor exhibited a marked impairment of human chorionic
gonadotropin binding. Western blot analysis of the expressed V144F
mutant receptor protein showed the absence of the glycosylated cell
surface form. Treatment of the mutant LHCG receptor with N-glycosidase F
or endoglycosidase-H demonstrated that the mutant receptor is retained
in the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression and study of enhanced green
fluorescent protein-tagged receptors confirmed that the mutant receptors
do not migrate to the cell surface.

.0029
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, MALE-LIMITED
LHCGR, ASP564GLY

In a boy who was diagnosed with gonadotropin-independent precocious
puberty (176410) at 4 years of age, Leschek et al. (2001) identified an
asp564-to-gly (D564G) substitution in exon 11 of the LHCGR gene in
peripheral blood leukocytes. At 10.8 years of age, routine ultrasound
examination led to the discovery of 2 right testicular masses; after
excisional biopsy, histologic examination showed nodular Leydig cell
hyperplasia surrounded by normal-appearing seminiferous tubules with
spermatogenesis, and DNA from tumor tissue revealed the same D564G
mutation that was present in peripheral blood leukocytes.

605325	TITLE *605325 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIIA, POLYPEPTIDE 5; CYP3A5
;;P450PCN3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CYP3A enzymes are the most abundantly expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes
in liver and are responsible for the metabolism of over 50% of all
clinically used drugs (Paulussen et al., 2000).

CLONING

By screening a liver cDNA library with CYP3A4 (124010) as probe, Aoyama
et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA encoding CYP3A5, which they termed PCN3.
Immunoblot analysis of liver microsomes showed that CYP3A5 is expressed
as a 52.5-kD protein, whereas CYP3A4 migrates as a 52.0-kD protein. The
deduced 502-amino acid CYP3A5 protein shares 85% sequence similarity
with CYP3A4. Analysis of enzymatic activity established that CYP3A4 and
CYP3A5 have overlapping substrate specificity with minor differences in
the metabolism of steroids and cyclosporine, suggesting that CYP3A4 may
bind these drugs at more than 1 site.

MAPPING

Jounaidi et al. (1994) isolated the 5-prime flanking region of CYP3A5
from a genomic clone on chromosome 7. Promoter analysis determined that
CYP3A5 uses a CATAA, rather than a TATA, box at positions -23 to -28 and
has a basic transcription element from -35 to -50. Jounaidi et al.
(1994) stated that CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 appear to be tandemly associated
and transcribed in the same direction.

Gellner et al. (2001) found that a 231-kb region on chromosome 7q21.1
contains 3 CYP3A genes: CYP3A4 (124010), CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 (605340), as
well as 3 pseudogenes and a novel CYP3A gene, which they termed CYP3A43
(606534).

GENE FUNCTION

Yamakoshi et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA clone for CYP3A5 from a prostate
library and determined that it has a unique 5-prime untranslated
sequence, suggesting that CYP3A5 is differentially regulated in liver
and prostate. Enzymatic analysis showed that the prostate form of the
enzyme can metabolize sex hormones.

Kuehl et al. (2001) stated that variation in the CYP3A enzymes
influences circulating steroid levels and responses to half of all
oxidatively metabolized drugs. CYP3A activity is the sum activity of the
family of CYP3A genes, including CYP3A5, which is polymorphically
expressed at high levels in a minority of Caucasians. Only individuals
with at least one CYP3A5*1 (wildtype) allele express large amounts of
CYP3A5. Kuehl et al. (2001) demonstrated that SNPs in CYP3A5*3 (6986A-G;
605235.0001) and CYP3A5*6 (a G-to-A transition in exon 7 resulting in
deletion of that exon), which cause alternative splicing and protein
truncation, result in the absence of CYP3A5 from tissues of some people.
CYP3A5 was more frequently expressed in livers of African Americans
(60%) than in those of Caucasians (33%). Because CYP3A5 represents at
least 50% of the total hepatic CYP3A content in people polymorphically
expressing CYP3A5, CYP3A5 may be the most important genetic contributor
to interindividual and interracial differences in CYP3A-dependent drug
clearance and in responses to many medicines. There are substantial
interindividual differences in CYP3A expression, exceeding 30-fold in
some populations. The polymorphic distribution of the wildtype CYP3A5*1
allele indicates that relatively high levels of metabolically active
CYP3A5 are expressed by an estimated 30% of Caucasians, 30% of Japanese,
30% of Mexicans, 40% of Chinese, and more than 50% of African Americans,
Southeast Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Southwestern American Indians.
The higher prevalence of CYP3A5 expression indicates that these
non-Caucasians are more likely to experience higher clearance of drugs
principally inactivated by CYP3A; are less likely to experience
dose-limiting toxicities; and have different risks of diseases that are
associated with the CYP3A5 expressor phenotype.

Kuehl et al. (2001) proposed that the expressor allele confers a
selective advantage in equatorial populations that may experience water
shortages. Thompson et al. (2004) genotyped the CYP3A5*1/*3
polymorphism, which is likely to influence salt and water retention and
risk for salt-sensitive hypertension (145500), in more than 1,000
individuals from 52 worldwide population samples. The results revealed
an unusual geographic pattern whereby the CYP3A5*3 frequency showed
extreme variation across populations and was significantly correlated
with distance from the equator. Furthermore, an unlinked variant, a
met235-to-thr SNP in the AGT gene (M235T; 106150.0001), previously
implicated in hypertension and preeclampsia, exhibited a similar
geographic distribution and had a significantly correlated frequency
with CYP3A5*1/*3. Thompson et al. (2004) concluded that variants that
influence salt homeostasis are the targets of a shared selective
pressure that results from an environmental variable correlated with
latitude.

Lee et al. (2003) identified 4 novel SNPs in the CYP3A5 gene producing
coding changes in different ethnic groups. R28C occurred in African
populations (allelic frequency, 4%), A337T occurred in Asians (allelic
frequency, 2%), L82R occurred in a racially unidentified group, and
F446S occurred in Caucasians (allelic frequency, 2%). These SNPs were on
an allele containing the CYP3A5*3 SNP. The newly identified allelic
proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in E.
coli, and purified. CYP3A5*1 exhibited the highest maximal clearance for
testosterone, followed by A337T, which was greater than R28C; R28C was
much greater than F446S. F446S exhibited a more than 95% decrease in the
intrinsic clearance for both testosterone and nifedipine oxidation, and
was predicted to be more catalytically defective than the splice change
alone.

The cholesterol lowering agents lovastatin, simvastatin, and
atorvastatin are metabolized primarily by CYP3A4; however, the
polymorphic CYP3A5 also contributes to the biotransformation of these
statins. Individuals carrying at least 1 copy of the wildtype CYP3A5*1
allele express CYP3A5 protein in the liver and some extrahepatic tissues
such as the small intestine, whereas CYP3A5*3 homozygotes are designated
CYP3A5 nonexpressors. Kivisto et al. (2004) studied whether expression
of CYP3A5 is associated with an impaired lipid-lowering response to
statins in 69 Caucasian patients. They found that lovastatin,
simvastatin, and atorvastatin were significantly less effective in
CYP3A5 expressors than in nonexpressors. No association between
hypolipidemic efficacy and CYP3A5 polymorphism was observed among 23
subjects taking statins that are not dependent on CYP3A5 (viz.,
fluvastatin or pravastatin).

HISTORY

Paulussen et al. (2000) analyzed what was thought to be the 5-prime
flanking region of the CYP3A5 gene and reported 2 linked polymorphisms,
-369T/G and -45A/G, located in transcriptional regulatory elements that
were associated with increased expression and activity of the gene.
Kuehl et al. (2001) noted, however, that sequencing of the CYP3A locus
revealed that these SNPs were actually in the promoter of the pseudogene
CYP3AP1, and thus could not be the basis for polymorphic CYP3A5
expression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERTENSION, SALT-SENSITIVE ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
CYP3A5, 6986A-G

In many populations, total adult CYP3A protein content of tissues
remains constant and consists largely of CYP3A4, whereas CYP3A5
expression has extreme interpopulation variability. This variation is
largely due to a 6986A-G substitution in intron 3 of CYP3A5 (the
CYP3A5*3 allele; SV1-CYP3A5) that results in improperly spliced mRNA and
a nonfunctional protein truncated at amino acid 102 (Kuehl et al., 2001;
Lin et al., 2002). The CYP3A5*3 allele is reported to have a frequency
of approximately 27 to 50% among African Americans, 85 to 95% among
whites (Hustert et al., 2001; Kuehl et al., 2001), and 60 to 73% among
Asians (Hustert et al., 2001).

Givens et al. (2003) found that, among renal microsomes from 21 organ
donors, those from *1/*3 individuals had at least 8-fold higher mean
kidney microsomal CYP3A5 content and 18-fold higher mean CYP3A catalytic
activity than did those from *3/*3 individuals (p = 0.0001 and p =
0.0137, respectively). They also found significant associations between
the 6986A-G polymorphism and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.0007), mean
arterial pressure (p = 0.0075), and creatinine clearance (p = 0.0035)
among 25 healthy African American adults. The associations remained
significant when sex, age, and body mass index were considered. The mean
systolic blood pressure of homozygous CYP3A5 expressors (*1/*1) exceeded
that of homozygous nonexpressors (*3/*3) by 19.3 mm Hg. Givens et al.
(2003) speculated that a high CYPA5 expressor allele frequency among
African Americans may contribute to a high prevalence of salt-sensitive
hypertension (145500) in this population.

Thompson et al. (2004) found that the CYP3A5*3 allele is significantly
correlated with distance from the equator. They noted that a
met235-to-thr SNP in the AGT gene (M235T; 106150.0001), previously
implicated in hypertension and preeclampsia, exhibited a similar
geographic distribution and had a significantly correlated frequency
with CYP3A5*1/*3. Thompson et al. (2004) concluded that variants that
influence salt homeostasis are the targets of a shared selective
pressure that results from an environmental variable correlated with
latitude.

602291	TITLE *602291 FORKHEAD BOX J1; FOXJ1
;;FORKHEAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 13; FKHL13;;
HFH4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXJ1 is a member of the forkhead gene family, which was originally
identified in Drosophila. The forkhead family is composed of
transcription factors with a conserved 100-amino acid DNA-binding motif.

CLONING

Using the forkhead domain of the rat Hnf3-alpha gene (602294) as a
probe, Murphy et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA from a human testis library
whose sequence showed more than 90% homology with that of rat Hfh4
within the putative coding region. The open reading frame predicted a
403-amino acid protein. By RT-PCR, Murphy et al. (1997) found FKHL13
expression in human testis, oviduct, lung, and brain cortex, which
suggests that expression may be associated with ciliated/flagellated
cells.

Using the rat Hfh4 forkhead domain to probe a fetal lung cDNA library,
Pelletier et al. (1998) cloned FOXJ1, which they called HFH4. The
deduced 421-amino acid protein contains a central 101-amino acid
forkhead domain. HFH4 shares about 91% amino acid identity with mouse
and rat Hfh4, including 100% identity within the forkhead domain.
Northern blot analysis of several adult and fetal tissues detected
highest expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in adult testis. Lower levels
were detected in adult ovary and lung and in fetal brain, lung, and
kidney. No expression was detected in several other adult tissues and
fetal liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By in situ hybridization of fetal tissue at several developmental
stages, Pelletier et al. (1998) found that expression of HFH4 was
associated with differentiation of the proximal pulmonary epithelium,
starting during the pseudoglandular stage of lung development. During
renal morphogenesis, HFH4 was expressed in the developing epithelial
cells of the ureteric duct, glomerulus, and epithelial vesicles.

Using a microarray-based screen, Yu et al. (2008) found that Foxj1a was
positively regulated in response to hedgehog (see SHH; 600725) signaling
in the developing zebrafish neural tube floorplate. Loss of Foxj1a
compromised the assembly of motile cilia that decorate neural tube floor
plate cells. Foxj1a was also expressed in Kupffer vesicles and
pronephric ducts, where it promoted ciliary differentiation. Foxj1a
activated a constellation of genes essential for motile cilia formation
and function, and its activity was sufficient for ectopic development of
motile cilia. Yu et al. (2008) also identified a paralogous gene,
Foxj1b, that was expressed in zebrafish otic vesicle and appeared to
regulate motile cilia formation in that tissue. Yu et al. (2008)
concluded that FOXJ1 is a master regulator of a transcriptional program
that controls the production of motile cilia.

Venugopalan et al. (2008) showed that Foxj1 and the homeobox
transcription factor Pitx2 (601542) were coexpressed temporally during
development of mouse orofacial structures, including molar inner enamel
epithelium, oral and tongue epithelium, and submandibular gland.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Pitx2 bound the
Foxj1 promoter in a mouse ameloblast cell line. Reporter gene assays
showed that the Pitx2a and Pitx2c isoforms strongly activated the Foxj1
promoter, whereas the Pitx2b isoform more weakly activated Foxj1. Pitx2a
interacted with Lef1 (153245) and beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) to
activate the Foxj1 promoter, and once activated, Foxj1 contributed to
its own activation in a positive feedback loop.

GENE STRUCTURE

Murphy et al. (1997) isolated a genomic clone of FKHL13 and showed that
the gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

Using PCR of human-hamster hybrid cell lines, Murphy et al. (1997)
localized the FKHL13 gene to chromosome 17, supporting the map position
of 17q22-q25 predicted by Avraham et al. (1995) on the basis of
comparative mapping of the mouse Hfh4 gene. By Southern blot analysis,
Pelletier et al. (1998) mapped the HFH4 gene to chromosome 17q23-qter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Korean population comprising 295 patients with allergic rhinitis
(607154) and 418 controls, Li et al. (2006) reported a significant
association between allergic rhinitis and 3 SNPs of the FOXJ1 gene:
-460C-T (dbSNP rs880213), 1805G-T (dbSNP rs1868823), and 3375G-C (dbSNP
rs3192453). Haplotype analysis revealed that the main haplotype, CGG of
the 3 SNPs respectively, was significantly associated with allergic
rhinitis (p = 0.000018). There was no association between the SNPs and
serum IgE levels. Li et al. (2006) suggested that dysregulation of FOXJ1
may affect T cell activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

To define the role of HFH4, Chen et al. (1998) created a targeted
mutation in the mouse Hfh4 gene. In mice with the homozygous disruption,
no expression of Hfh4 was detected. The homozygous mice were noted to
have abnormalities of organ situs consistent with random determination
of left-right asymmetry. In addition, a complete absence of cilia was
noted in Hfh4 -/- mice. The Hfh4 gene is thus essential for nonrandom
determination of left-right asymmetry and development of ciliated cells.
Homozygous mutant mice also exhibited prenatal and postnatal growth
failure, perinatal lethality, and, in some cases, hydrocephalus. RT-PCR
revealed an absence of left-right dynein (lrd) expression in the
embryonic lungs of Hfh4 -/- mice, suggesting that HFH4 may act by
regulating expression of members of the dynein family of genes. These
abnormalities are similar to those observed in human congenital
syndromes such as the recessive disorder Kartagener syndrome (244400).

Stubbs et al. (2008) found that the cilia underlying left-right
patterning on the Xenopus gastrocoel roof plate and zebrafish Kupffer
vesicle were severely shortened or failed to form in Foxj1 morphants.
Misexpression of Foxj1 was sufficient to induce ectopic gastrocoel roof
plate-like cilia in frog embryos. Microarray analysis indicated that
Xenopus Foxj1 induced formation of cilia by upregulating expression of
motile cilia genes.

To avoid embryonic lethality in Foxj1-deficient mice, Lin et al. (2004)
targeted Foxj1 deficiency to the lymphoid system using fetal liver
chimeras. By 12- to 16-weeks postreconstitution, a large proportion of
mice that had received Foxj1 null fetal livers appeared moribund, with
ruffled fur and hunched posture. Upon histopathologic examination,
Foxj1-deficient chimeras displayed multiorgan systemic inflammation,
exaggerated Th1 cytokine production, and T-cell proliferation in
autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions. Foxj1 suppressed nuclear factor
kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) transcription activity in vitro, and
Foxj1-deficient T cells possessed increased NFKB activity in vivo,
correlating with the ability of Foxj1 to regulate I-kappa-B proteins,
particularly IKKB (604495). Lin et al. (2004) concluded that FOXJ1
antagonizes proinflammatory transcriptional activities and potentially
enforces lymphocyte quiescence.

Srivatsan and Peng (2005) found that autoimmunity-prone mice with T
cells ectopically expressing Foxj1 showed a significant reduction in
lymphadenopathy, pathogenic autoantibodies, and end-organ disease.
Reversion of autoimmunity was not attributable to Nfkb modulation, but
rather to peripheral T-cell lymphopenia due to impaired exodus of cells
from the thymus. Srivatsan and Peng (2005) concluded that FOXJ1 is not
only important in regulating T-cell tolerance, but also in regulating
thymocyte egress.

605326	TITLE *605326 TAX1-BINDING PROTEIN 1; TAX1BP1
;;HUMAN T-CELL LEUKEMIA VIRUS TYPE 1-BINDING PROTEIN;;
TXBP151;;
TRAF6-INTERACTING PROTEIN; T6BP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HTLV-1 Tax protein transcriptionally activates the HTLV-1 promoter.
Tax also binds to and stimulates the expression of cellular genes,
including transcription factors and other proteins (Gachon et al.,
1998).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse fibrosarcoma library with A20
(see TNFAIP3; 191163) as bait, followed by a screening of a HeLa cell
cDNA library, De Valck et al. (1999) isolated a TAX1BP1 cDNA, which the
authors termed TXBP151, encoding a 747-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of 1.9- and 2.4-kb transcripts in various
cell lines. Western blot analysis showed that TAX1BP1 is expressed as an
86-kD or a 68-kD protein.

By a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library with TRAF6
(602355) as bait, Ling and Goeddel (2000) isolated a TAX1BP1 cDNA, which
they termed T6BP. Sequence analysis determined that TAX1BP1 contains 3
coiled-coil domains and 2 helix loop-helix regions.

GENE FUNCTION

De Valck et al. (1999) showed that overexpression of TAX1BP1 or A20
leads to apoptosis of NIH 3T3 cell lines, which could be partially
blocked by antisense TAX1BP1. Apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor
(TNF; 191160) or CD95 (134637) leads to TAX1BP1, but not A20,
degradation. This degradation could be blocked by CASP3 (600636)-like
inhibitors.

By coprecipitation and immunoblot analysis, Ling and Goeddel (2000)
showed that TAX1BP1 binds TRAF6 but not TRAFs 1-5; the interaction
requires the N-terminal zinc and ring finger domains of TRAF6 and either
the N-terminal first coiled-coil region or the 2 coiled-coil regions of
the C-terminus of TAX1BP1. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis
determined that stimulation of cells with IL1B (147720), but not with
TNF or CD40LG (see 300386), induces independent, mutually exclusive
TRAF6/TAX1BP1 complexes as well as TRAF6/IRAK (300283) complexes.
Transient expression of TRAF6, but not TAX1BP1, induces NFKB and JNK
(MAPK8; 601158) activation.

Shembade et al. (2010) showed that A20 inhibits the E3 ligase activities
of TRAF6, TRAF2 (601895), and cIAP1 (601712) by antagonizing
interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC13 (603679) and
UBCH5C (602963). A20, together with the regulatory molecule TAX1BP1,
interacted with UBC13 and UBCH5C and triggered their ubiquitination and
proteasome-dependent degradation. These findings suggested a mechanism
of A20 action in the inhibition of inflammatory signaling pathways.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TAX1BP1
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP WI-11921).

137150	TITLE *137150 4-@AMINOBUTYRATE AMINOTRANSFERASE; ABAT
;;GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRATE TRANSAMINASE; GABAT;;
GABA-TRANSFERASE;;
GABA-TRANSAMINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ABAT gene encodes gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.19),
which catalyzes the conversion of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an
important, mostly inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous
system, into succinic semialdehyde (Osei and Churchich, 1995).

CLONING

Osei and Churchich (1995) used a probe from the pig GABAT cDNA to screen
a human brain cDNA library. They identified a human GABAT cDNA, which
encodes a deduced 500-amino acid protein that is over 95% similar to the
pig protein. The active enzyme is a homodimer of 50-kD subunits
complexed to pyridoxal-5-phosphate. GABAT is present in several tissues
in addition to brain and is most active in liver.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ABAT
gene to chromosome 16p13.3 (TMAP RH69040).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jeremiah and Povey (1981) suggested that GABAT in liver and brain is
controlled by 2 codominant alleles with a frequency in a Caucasian
population of 0.56 and 0.44. A 3-banded pattern in heterozygotes
suggested that GABAT is a dimeric protein. Bhattacharyya et al. (1985)
gave gene frequencies for Chinese, Indians, and Malays living in
Singapore and described a new allele.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

- GABA-Transaminase Deficiency

In a patient with GABA-transaminase deficiency (613163) reported by
Jaeken et al. (1984), Medina-Kauwe et al. (1999) identified a mutation
in the ABAT gene (R220K; 137150.0001). The second allele in the patient
remained unidentified. A second unrelated patient had a deletion in the
ABAT gene (137150.0002). Both patients had severe psychomotor
retardation, seizures, hypotonia, and hyperreflexia and died before age
2 years.

GABA-TRANSAMINASE DEFICIENCY
ABAT, ARG220LYS

In a patient with GABA-transaminase deficiency (613163) reported by
Jaeken et al. (1984), Medina-Kauwe et al. (1999) identified a 754A-G
transition in the ABAT gene, resulting in an arg220-to-lys (R220K)
substitution in a highly conserved residue. Expression of the mutant in
E. coli, followed by isolation and enzymatic characterization of the
recombinant protein, revealed an enzyme whose Vmax was reduced to 25% of
wildtype activity. The second allele in the patient remained
unidentified.

612383	TITLE *612383 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 11; MED11
;;HSPC296
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED11 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is a coactivator for
DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA polymerase II
(Sato et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using HeLa cells overexpressing epitope-tagged MED10 (612382), Sato et
al. (2003) purified several components of the human Mediator complex,
including MED11, which they called HSPC296, and they cloned the
corresponding cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro-translated epitope-tagged proteins for protein-binding
assays, Sato et al. (2003) found that MED11 directly interacted with the
mediator subunit SURF5 (MED22; 185641). The MED11-SURF5 heterodimer
could also be coimmunoprecipitated from cotransfected insect cells or
Escherichia coli.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MED11 gene to chromosome 16p13.2 based on an
alignment of the MED11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF161414) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

610715	TITLE *610715 HEMOGEN; HEMGN
;;ERYTHROID DIFFERENTIATION-ASSOCIATED GENE; EDAG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Yang et al. (2001) cloned mouse Hemgn and, by database analysis and
RT-PCR of a K562 myelogenous leukemia cell line cDNA library, they
cloned human HEMGN, or EDAG. The deduced mouse and human proteins
contain 503 and 484 amino acids, respectively, and share 43% identity. A
coiled-coil region and bipartite nuclear localization signal are
conserved in the N termini of both proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 2.4-kb transcript and a minor 1.8-kb transcript in
adult human bone marrow and fetal liver. RT-PCR detected high HEMGN
expression in untreated and mitogen-treated K562 cells, adult bone
marrow, and CD34 (142230)-positive progenitor cells. Lower expression
was detected in a child thymus and in a histiocyte lymphoma cell line,
but no expression was detected in cultured T cells, monocytes, and
nonhematopoietic cell lines examined. Northern blot analysis of adult
mice detected Hemgn expression in bone marrow and spleen, but not in
thymus and nonhematopoietic tissues. In situ hybridization of adult
spleen revealed Hemgn in red, but not white, pulp. In situ hybridization
of day-8.5 mouse embryos showed Hemgn in blood islands of the yolk sac
and in circulating primitive blood cells. Hemgn was expressed in
developing hepatic primordia at day 10.5 and, from day 11.5, it was
expressed exclusively in fetal liver. FACS analysis showed Hemgn in
hematopoietic precursors of adult mice, but not in mature blood cells.
Transfected COS-7 cells expressed mouse Hemgn in nuclei, but not in
nucleoli or cytoplasm.

By database analysis, Yang et al. (2003) identified a testis-specific
HEMGN splice variant that they called HEMGN-t. HEMGN-t and the
hematopoietic variant, HEMGN-h, differ in their 5-prime and 3-prime
UTRs, but they have the same coding region. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.9-kb HEMGN-t transcript in mouse and human testis. In situ
hybridization of adult mouse testis revealed Hemgn only in round
spermatids. Northern blot analysis showed that Hemgn expression in
prepubertal mouse testis correlated with the appearance of postmeiotic
cells, and Hemgn expression was weak in testis of mice lacking
postmeiotic germ cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2004) found that downregulation of EDAG in K562 cells
resulted in inhibition of growth and colony formation, as well as
enhancement of sensitivity to erythroid differentiation induced by
hemin. Overexpression of EDAG in a human myeloid leukemia cell line
significantly blocked expression of the monocyte/macrophage
differentiation marker CD11b (ITGAM; 120980) after mitogen exposure.
Moreover, overexpression of EDAG in a mouse pro-B cell line prolonged
survival and increased expression of Myc (190080), Bcl2 (151430), and
Bclxl (600039) in the absence of interleukin-3 (IL3; 147740). EDAG
enhanced the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011),
and high DNA-binding activity of Nfkb was sustained in EDAG-expressing
pre-B cells after IL3 withdrawal. In these cells, inhibition of Nfkb
activity promoted cell death. Li et al. (2004) concluded that EDAG
regulates proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and
resists cell death through activation of NFKB.

By examining expression of a mouse Hemgn promoter-reporter plasmid in
transgenic mice, Yang et al. (2006) showed that the promoter was
transcriptionally active in embryonic yolk sac, fetal liver, and adult
spleen, bone marrow, brain, thymus, lung, and testis. Mutagenesis
analysis showed that 2 highly conserved GATA boxes were critical for
promoter activity. GATA1 (305371), but not GATA2 (137295), bound to the
GATA-binding sites and transactivated the Hemgn promoter in a
dose-dependent manner. Yang et al. (2006) also found that levels of
HEMGN and GATA1 transcripts closely correlated in human primary acute
myeloid leukemia specimens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yang et al. (2001) determined that the HEMGN gene spans 18 kb and
contains 5 exons. The first exon is specific to the HEMGN-t variant and
encodes an alternative 5-prime UTR. The donor-acceptor sequence used for
this alternative first exon is GC-AC instead of the canonical GT-AG. The
last exon of HEMGN contains 2 alternative noncanonical polyadenylation
sequences used by the HEMGN-t and HEMGN-h variants. Two promoters in the
5-prime region direct transcription of HEMGN-t and HEMGN-h and are
separated by 6 kb.

Yang et al. (2006) found that the region upstream of the HEMGN coding
sequence contains several evolutionarily conserved sequences and that
the proximal promoter contains a TATA box and 2 conserved GATA boxes.

MAPPING

By FISH, Yang et al. (2003) mapped the HEMGN gene to chromosome 9q22.
They mapped the mouse Hemgn gene to chromosome 4A5-B2.

;;FERREDOXIN:NADP(+) REDUCTASE;;
ADRENODOXIN REDUCTASE; ADXR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adrenodoxin reductase (ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase; EC 1.18.1.2) is a
mitochondrial flavoprotein that receives electrons from NADPH, thus
initiating the electron-transport chain serving mitochondrial
cytochromes P450.

CLONING

Solish et al. (1988) cloned and sequenced 2 human ADXR cDNAs that
differed by the presence of 6 additional codons in the middle of 1
clone. The sequence in this region of the clones indicated that these 6
extra codons rose by alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA. Lin et al.
(1990) identified 2 forms of ADXR mRNA, which differed by the absence or
presence of 18 bases in the middle of the sequence; these arise through
alternative splicing at the 5-prime end of exon 7.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin et al. (1990) found that the ADXR gene spans 12 kb and consists of
12 exons. The first exon encodes the first 26 of the 32 amino acids of
the signal peptide, and the second exon encodes the remainder of the
signal peptide and the apparent FAD binding site. The remaining 10 exons
are clustered in a region of only 4.3 kb, separated from the first 2
exons by a large intron of about 5.6 kb. Southern blot analysis
indicated that the human genome contains only 1 ADXR gene.

MAPPING

By analysis of DNA from a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids,
Solish et al. (1988) localized the gene to 17cen-q25. By in situ
hybridization, Sparkes et al. (1991) refined the assignment to
17q24-q25.

;;WILLIAMS-BEUREN SYNDROME CHROMOSOME REGION 1; WBSCR1;;
WSCR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Osborne et al. (1996) identified the WBSCR1 gene within the
Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) critical region at 7q11.23. The
WSCR1 gene encodes a deduced 232 amino acids, including an RNA-binding
domain consensus sequence. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb
WBSCR1 transcript in all human cell lines analyzed.

Richter-Cook et al. (1998) identified the eukaryotic initiation factor
(EIF) 4H protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate on the basis of its
ability to stimulate translation in an in vitro globin synthesis assay
deficient in EIF4B (603928) and EIF4F. Amino acid sequence analysis of 3
EIF4H tryptic fragments revealed 100% sequence identity to the human
WBSCR1 protein. The authors demonstrated that the 25-kD rabbit EIF4H
protein stimulates the in vitro activities of EIF4B and EIF4F in globin
synthesis, as well as the in vitro RNA-dependent ATPase activities of
EIF4A (e.g., 601102), EIF4B, and EIF4F.

MAPPING

Osborne et al. (1996) characterized a 500-kb region in 7q11.23 that was
deleted in a collection of 30 William-Beuren syndrome patients. They
constructed a detailed physical map of the region consisting of cosmids,
P1 artificial chromosomes, and yeast artificial chromosomes. They
identified 9 transcription units from the area, including the previously
characterized genes ELN (130160), LIMK1 (601329), and RFC2 (600404), and
the novel genes WSCR1 and WSCR4 (603432).

GENE STRUCTURE

Osborne et al. (1996) determined that the WSCR1 gene has 6 exons.

610284	TITLE *610284 LIPOYLTRANSFERASE 1; LIPT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.

614459	TITLE *614459 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 138; TMEM138
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMEM138 is required for the assembly and function of cilia (Lee et al.,
2012).

CLONING

Lee et al. (2012) identified the TMEM138 gene near the TMEM216 (613277)
gene in a region of chromosome 11 linked to Joubert syndrome-2 (JBTS2;
608091). They obtained TMEM138 clones, including potential variants,
from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced major isoform of
TMEM138 contains 162 amino acids and has an N-terminal signal sequence
followed by 3 transmembrane domains. Expression profiling showed TMEM138
expression in all tissues examined. In situ hybridization of human
embryos at 4 to 8 weeks' gestation revealed ubiquitous TMEM138
expression that increased with time. TMEM138 expression appeared to
parallel TMEM216 expression in all tissues examined. Immunohistochemical
analysis of mouse IMCD3 cells and transfected COS-7 cells revealed that
Tmem138 localized to ciliary axoneme/basal body and that Tmem216
localized to basal body and to the Golgi apparatus surrounding the base
of cilium. The 2 proteins also appeared to localize to different vesicle
pools that moved toward the primary cilia over time. Tmem138 vesicles,
but not Tmem216 vesicles, colocalized with endogenous Cep290 (610142) in
IMCD3 cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (2012) determined that the TMEM138 gene contains 5 exons, the
first of which is noncoding. The 23-kb intergenic region between TMEM138
and TMEM216 contains a functional conserved RFX4 (603958)-binding site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lee et al. (2012) mapped the TMEM138 gene
to chromosome 11q12.2, 23 kb from the TMEM216 gene. TMEM138 and TMEM216
are in a head-to-tail orientation.

Lee et al. (2012) mapped the mouse Tmem138 gene to a region of
chromosome 19 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11q12.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2012) found that RFX4 mediated coordinated expression of
TMEM138 and TMEM216 by binding to a regulatory element within their
intergenic region. Knockdown of either Tmem138 or Tmem216 in mouse IMCD3
cells resulted in short cilia and a defect in ciliogenesis. Knockdown of
Tmem216 disrupted vesicular trafficking of Tmem138 and Cep290, whereas
knockdown of Tmem138 had little effect on vesicular movement of Tmem216.
Knockdown of Trappc9 (611966), a component of the transport protein
particle (TRAPP) II complex, disrupted vesicular tethering of both
proteins and reduced ciliogenesis.

EVOLUTION

Lee et al. (2012) found that the TMEM138 and TMEM216 genes are aligned
in a head-to-tail orientation, with a conserved intergenic region, in
higher vertebrates only. They determined that the 2 genes came into
close association during an ancient chromosomal rearrangement at the
amphibian-to-reptile transition about 340 million years ago.
Conservation in the intergenic region becomes progressively weaker from
human to anolis lizard, and the orthologous genes map to different
chromosomes in zebrafish.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By repeat sequencing of candidate genes in 6 consanguineous Arab
families with Joubert syndrome showing linkage to the JBTS2 locus
(608091) on chromosome 11q13, but who were negative for mutations in the
TMEM216 gene (613277), Lee et al. (2012) identified homozygous mutations
in the TMEM138 gene (614459.0001-614459.0005). None of the mutations was
found in 400 controls. Two additional patients from consanguineous Arab
families were also found to carry homozygous TMEM138 mutations. The
phenotype included the molar tooth sign on brain imaging, oculomotor
apraxia, variable coloboma, and rare kidney involvement. The phenotype
was indistinguishable from that caused by mutation in TMEM216 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2012) found that knockdown of zebrafish Tmem138 or Tmem216
resulted in similar, but distinct, phenotypes. Knockdown of either gene
resulted in pericardial effusion, curved or kinked tail, and
gastrulation defects. However, only knockdown of Tmem16 resulted in
hydrocephalic brains.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

TMEM138, IVS2DS, G-A, +5

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Arab families with Joubert
syndrome-16 (JBTS16; 614465), Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
G-to-A transition in exon 2 of the TMEM138 gene, resulting in a splice
site mutation at a highly conserved position. Features were somewhat
variable, but included the molar tooth sign on brain imaging, oculomotor
apraxia, and coloboma. One patient had cystic kidneys and another had
polydactyly.

In 2 Arab sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with JBTS16 (614465),
Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 287A-G transition in the
TMEM138 gene, resulting in a his96-to-arg (H96R) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. A 17-year-old boy had the molar tooth sign and
a Dandy-Walker malformation, oculomotor apraxia, and nephronophthisis.
An affected fetus had an encephalocele and was diagnosed with Meckel
syndrome. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant
H96R protein was expressed at about 40% of control levels, suggesting a
loss of function as the disease mechanism.

;;MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 22, FORMERLY; MMP22, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The matrix metalloproteinases are secreted glycoproteins that are
involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. By analysis of
the genomic region surrounding the duplicated genes CDC2L1 (176873) and
CDC2L2 (116951), Gururajan et al. (1998) identified 2 novel matrix
metalloproteinase genes, MMP23A (603320), which they called MMP21, and
MMP23B, which they called MMP22. The nucleotide sequences of MMP21 and
MMP22 are nearly identical.

MAPPING

Gururajan et al. (1998) reported that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes are
located on 1p36.3 in a region that contains 2 identical genomic
segments. Each segment consists of a CDC2L gene linked to an MMP gene in
a tail-to-tail orientation.

605255	TITLE *605255 ETS VARIANT GENE 7; ETV7
;;ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TEL2; TEL2;;
TELB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors,
of which ETV7 is a member, is a large group of evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional regulators that play an important role in a variety of
cellular processes throughout development and differentiation, and are
involved in oncogenesis as well (Potter et al., 2000).

CLONING

Potter et al. (2000) sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to a novel ETS
gene from an activated T-cell cDNA library, as well as from breast
tissue and meningioma cDNA libraries. The cDNA, which the authors
designated TEL2, encodes a deduced 341-amino acid protein that shares
38% sequence identity with TEL1 (ETV6; 600618). TEL2 contains a
C-terminal ETS domain and an N-terminal PNT domain, which is thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of TEL2 mRNA predominantly in hematopoietic tissues; a
predominant band of approximately 1.2 kb was present in fetal liver and
bone marrow and was faintly present in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Using antibodies raised against the C terminus of the TEL2 protein,
Potter et al. (2000) showed that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. The
striking similarities of TEL2 to TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic
tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggested that TEL2 may
be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

Poirel et al. (2000) identified the TELB gene by comparison of the TEL
sequence with genomic sequence databases. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of TELB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Potter et al. (2000) determined that the TEL2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within a PAC
clone, Potter et al. (2000) mapped the TEL2 gene to chromosome 6p21.

Poirel et al. (2000) mapped the TELB gene to 6p21 by genomic sequence
analysis.

;;ENOLASE, ALPHA;;

ENOLASE, NONNEURONAL, INCLUDED; NNE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme (2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolyase; EC
4.2.1.11). Each of the 3 ENO isoenzymes is a homodimer composed of 2
alpha (ENO1), 2 gamma (ENO2; 131360), or 2 beta (ENO3; 131370) subunits.
Isoenzyme alpha (ENO1) is present in most tissues, whereas the beta form
(ENO3) is localized to muscle and the gamma form (ENO2) is found only in
nervous tissue (summary by Giallongo et al., 1986).

CLONING

Giallongo et al. (1986) cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA for
human alpha-enolase. Its coding region was found to be 1,299 bases long.
The 433-amino acid protein shows 67% homology to yeast enolase and 94%
homology to rat nonneural enolase.

Wistow et al. (1988) presented evidence for the remarkable conclusion
that alpha-enolase is encoded by the same gene that encodes
tau-crystallin, a lens structural protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Giallongo et al. (1990) determined that the ENO1 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

Giblett et al. (1974) observed an electrophoretic variant of red cell
PPH among Cree Indians. Linkage was found with the Rhesus locus. Since
the Rh locus has been assigned to chromosome 1 and since cell
hybridization studies assign the PPH locus to chromosome 1, the new data
are consistent. The Goss-Harris method of mapping combines features of
recombinational study in families and synteny tests in hybrid cells. As
applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2 and UMPK are distal
to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1: UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC):
ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Comings (1972) and Ohno (1973) suggested
that during vertebrate evolution tetraploidization occurred 2-3 hundred
million years ago and that chromosomal events that tend to preserve
ancestral linkage groups, such as Robertsonian fusions, inversions and
gene duplications, have been favored. Demonstration of linkage of
homologous genes supports this hypothesis.

D'Ancona et al. (1977) regionalized ENO1 to 1pter-p36.13. Lalley et al.
(1978) demonstrated synteny of enolase, PGD (172200), PGM1 (171900), and
AK2 (103020) on chromosome 4 of the mouse; they are on 1p of man.

- Pseudogene

Feo et al. (1990) concluded that there is a single alpha-enolase
pseudogene in the human genome. This intronless, processed pseudogene
was mapped to chromosome 1 by Southern blot analysis of rodent-human
hybrid cell DNAs; thus, it is on the same chromosome as the functional
gene. Ribaudo et al. (1996) confirmed the assignment of ENO1P to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, they found that it
is located on 1q41-q42, whereas the functional gene is located on the
short arm of that chromosome.

GENE FUNCTION

Lachant et al. (1986) and Lachant and Tanaka (1987) reported 4
generations of a Caucasian family with hereditary red cell enolase
deficiency. Partial deficiency in this kindred behaved as an autosomal
dominant and was associated with a spherocytic phenotype, although a
normal acidified glycerol lysis test suggested that the spherocytes of
enolase deficiency are different from those of hereditary spherocytosis
(see 182900). Clinical expression of enolase deficiency varied in this
family. Some had slightly low hematocrit with elevated reticulocytes,
while others had no evidence of anemia or hemolysis.

To identify the autoantigens related to Hashimoto encephalopathy, a rare
autoimmune disease associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis (140300), Ochi
et al. (2002) developed a human brain proteome map using 2-dimensional
electrophoresis and applied it to the immunoscreening of brain proteins
that react with autoantibodies in affected patients. They thereby
identified alpha-enolase as the autoantigen in that disorder.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Muller et al. (2012) proposed that homozygous deletions in passenger
genes in cancer deletions can expose cancer-specific therapeutic
vulnerabilities when the collaterally deleted gene is a member of a
functionally redundant family of genes carrying out an essential
function. The glycolytic gene ENO1 in the 1p36 locus is deleted in
glioblastoma, which is tolerated by the expression of ENO2 (131360).
Muller et al. (2012) showed that short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of
ENO2 selectively inhibits growth, survival, and the tumorigenic
potential of ENO1-deleted GBM cells, and that the enolase inhibitor
phosphonoacetohydroxamate is selectively toxic to ENO1-deleted GBM cells
relative to ENO1-intact GBM cells or normal astrocytes. Muller et al.
(2012) suggested that the principle of collateral vulnerability should
be applicable to other passenger-deleted genes encoding functionally
redundant essential activities and provide an effective treatment
strategy for cancers containing such genomic events.

610560	TITLE *610560 PROTEASE, SERINE, 36; PRSS36
;;POLYSERASE 2;;
POLYSERINE PROTEASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching human genomic databases with TMPRSS9 (610477) as query,
followed by PCR of liver RNA, Cal et al. (2005) cloned PRSS36, which
they called polyserase-2. The deduced 855-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 93 kD and contains 9 potential
N-glycosylation sites. PRSS36 contains a signal peptide, followed by a
propeptide domain, an active serine protease domain with the catalytic
his, asp, and ser residues, and 2 serine protease domains predicted to
be catalytically inactive. The first serine protease domain shares amino
acid identity of 40 to 42% with gamma-1 tryptase (TPSG1; 609341),
pancreasin (608018), matriptase (ST14; 606797), matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6;
609862), and polyserase-1 (TMPRSS9). Northern blot analysis detected a
5-kb transcript in fetal kidney and adult skeletal muscle, liver,
placenta, and heart. A 2.2-kb transcript was detected in placenta,
prostate, and colon and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and may be
produced by alternative splicing. Immunolocalization studies and Western
blot analysis indicated that PRSS36 is secreted as a glycosylated
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Cal et al. (2005) showed that purified recombinant PRSS36 constructs
lacking the prodomain hydrolyzed a variety of synthetic serine protease
substrates and that serine protease inhibitors inhibited these
activities. Activity of the first serine protease domain was higher than
that of the entire PRSS36 polyprotein.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cal et al. (2005) mapped the PRSS36 gene
to chromosome 16p11.2.

601197	TITLE *601197 TUBBY, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; TUB
DESCRIPTION A mutation in the mouse 'tubby' gene (tub) causes maturity-onset
obesity, insulin resistance, retinal degeneration, and neurosensory
hearing loss (Coleman and Eicher, 1990; Heckenlively et al., 1995). The
tub gene was found to lie 2.4 cM from the mouse Hbb gene on chromosome
7. For that reason Jones et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog
of tubby resides in 11p15 and that the HBB locus in the human could be
used as a linkage marker for the study of familial obesity in humans.

The human obesity syndromes described by Bardet, Biedl, and Alstrom have
certain features in common with the tubby phenotype. Bardet-Biedl
syndrome (BBS; see 209900), which is characterized by pigmentary
retinopathy, obesity, mental retardation, hypogenitalism, and
polysyndactyly, is genetically heterogeneous. Alstrom syndrome (203800),
which is characterized by retinitis pigmentosa, deafness, obesity, and
diabetes mellitus, maps to 2p13.

Noben-Trauth et al. (1996) identified a candidate gene for mouse tubby
on the basis of positional cloning. The candidate gene in tubby mice
differed consistently from that in normal mice with respect to
transcript size. Sequence analysis of the candidate gene revealed a
G-to-T transversion that abolished the donor splice site in the 3-prime
coding region, leading to a larger transcript in tubby. The transcript
was 6.6 kb in tubby versus 6.3 kb in B6 mice. Sequence analysis of the
candidate gene revealed that the 200 amino acids at the C terminus show
62% identity to a mouse phosphodiesterase. Because mutations in the cGMP
phosphodiesterase genes (e.g., 180071) are known to cause retinal
degeneration through photoreceptor cell apoptosis, and because the
retinal degeneration in tubby has hallmarks of apoptosis, Noben-Trauth
et al. (1996) postulated that mutations in the phosphodiesterase-like
candidate tubby gene lead to phenotypic effects through apoptotic
events.

Kleyn et al. (1996) also used positional cloning to identify a gene
responsible for the tubby phenotype in mice. Tubby mutants were found to
produce a larger transcript for this candidate gene (approximately 7.5
kb) than that produced by normal mice (7 kb). The RNA transcript in
tubby was also 4-fold more abundant than the transcript in normal mice.
The larger transcript in the mutant mice was due to a G-to-T
transversion in a single splice donor site, leading to the substitution
of 44 C-terminal amino acids, with 24 intron-encoded amino acids. The
mutation identified by Kleyn et al. (1996) is apparently the same as
that described by Noben-Trauth et al. (1996). Northern blot analysis
revealed that the candidate gene was expressed primarily in brain,
particularly in the paraventricular, ventromedial, and arcuate nuclei of
the hypothalamus. Kleyn et al. (1996) showed that strain-specific
differences occurred in the relative abundance of alternate splice
products. Alternate splice products differed with respect to the
presence or absence of exon 5. Kleyn et al. (1996) demonstrated that
this splice variation correlates with an intron length polymorphism and
proposed this tub allele as a candidate for the obesity quantitative
trait locus on mouse chromosome 7. Kleyn et al. (1996) isolated the
human homolog of the mouse tub gene and determined that there is 94%
identity between the human and the mouse sequence at the protein level
and that the C-terminal half of the molecule is particularly highly
conserved. See also UCP2 (601693).

Sahly et al. (1998) undertook expression mapping studies in an effort to
elucidate the biologic role of the TUB protein. They reported the tub
gene expression pattern in embryonic, fetal, and adult mouse tissues as
determined by Northern blots and in situ hybridization, using antisense
oligonucleotide probes. In mouse embryos, tub was expressed selectively
in differentiating neurons of the central and peripheral nervous
systems, starting at 9.5 days after conception. In adult mice, tub is
transcribed in several major brain areas, including cerebral cortex,
hippocampus, several nuclei of the hypothalamus controlling feeding
behavior, in the spiral ganglion of the inner ear, and in photoreceptor
cells of the retina. These structures contain potential cellular targets
of tubby mutation-induced pathogenesis. Spatial and temporal
coincidences of gene expression patterns, although not a direct proof,
suggested a similarity of function for TUB with carboxypeptidase E (CPE;
114855), which is the site of a null mutation in the fat/fat mouse,
prohormone convertase (PCSK1; 162150), which is involved in the
pathogenesis of one form of gross obesity, and other pro-proteases. The
findings were also considered compatible with the alternative hypothesis
that TUB is a neuropeptide involved in numerous neurophysiologic and
endocrine functions regulating feeding behavior and sensory perception.

Ikeda et al. (1999) performed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis
for auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, which indicate hearing
ability, in tubby mice from several F2 intercrosses. They identified a
major QTL, which they designated 'modifier of tubby hearing-1' (moth1),
that mapped to chromosome 2 with a lod score of 33.4 in the AKR
intercross and of 6.0 in the CAST intercross. This QTL was responsible
for 57% and 43% of ABR threshold variance, respectively, in each strain
combination. In addition, a C57BL/6J congenic line carrying a segment
encompassing the described QTL region also exhibited normal hearing
ability when made homozygous for tubby. Ikeda et al. (1999) hypothesized
that C57BL/6J mice carry a recessive mutation of the moth1 gene that
interacts with the tub mutation to cause hearing loss in tub/tub mice.
One allele from either AKR/J, CAST/Ei, or 129/Ola was sufficient to
protect C57BL/6J tub/tub mice from hearing loss. It remained to be
determined how the moth1 gene affects the other tubby phenotypes, such
as retinal degeneration and obesity. Ikeda et al. (2002) reported the
positional cloning of the auditory QTL modifying TUB1 as the MAP1A gene
(600178). Through a transgenic rescue experiment, Ikeda et al. (2002)
verified that sequence polymorphisms in the neuron-specific MAP1A gene
observed in the susceptible strain C57BL/6J are crucial for the hearing
loss phenotype. Ikeda et al. (2002) also showed that these polymorphisms
changed the binding efficiency of MAP1A to postsynaptic density molecule
PSD95 (602887), a core component in the cytoarchitecture of synapses.
Ikeda et al. (2002) concluded that at least some of the observed
polymorphisms are functionally important and that the hearing loss in
C57BL/6J-tub/tub mice may be caused by impaired protein interactions
involving MAP1A. They proposed that TUB may be associated with synaptic
function in neuronal cells.

Boggon et al. (1999) determined the crystal structure of the core domain
of mouse tubby at a resolution of 1.9 angstroms. From primarily
structural clues, Boggon et al. (1999) devised experiments, the results
of which suggested that tubby-like proteins are a unique family of
bipartite transcription factors. The tubby C-terminal is able to bind
double-stranded DNA, while the N-terminal regions of tubby and TULP1
potently activate transcription.

Santagata et al. (2001) demonstrated that tubby functions in signal
transduction from heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors. Tubby
localizes to the plasma membrane by binding phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate through its carboxy-terminal 'tubby domain.' X-ray
crystallography revealed the atomic-level basis of this interaction and
implicates tubby domains as phosphorylated-phosphatidylinositol-binding
factors. Receptor-mediated activation of G protein alpha-q (G-alpha-q;
600998) releases tubby from the plasma membrane through the action of
phospholipase C-beta (see 604114), triggering translocation of tubby to
the cell nucleus. The localization of tubby-like protein-3 (604730) is
similarly regulated. Santagata et al. (2001) concluded that tubby
proteins function as membrane-bound transcription regulators that
translocate to the nucleus in response to phosphoinositide hydrolysis,
providing a direct link between G protein signaling and the regulation
of gene expression.

603761	TITLE *603761 RAD9, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, A; RAD9A
;;RAD9, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; RAD9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In S. pombe, rad9 is one of 6 genes essential for both the incomplete
DNA replication (S-M) and DNA damage checkpoints. See HUS1 (603760). By
searching an EST database, Lieberman et al. (1996) identified a partial
cDNA encoding HRAD9, a human rad9 homolog. The authors used the partial
cDNA to recover additional human RAD9 cDNAs corresponding to the entire
coding region. The predicted 391-amino acid human protein is 25%
identical to S. pombe rad9.

GENE FUNCTION

Lieberman et al. (1996) found that the human RAD9 gene partially
complemented the hydroxyurea sensitivity, radiosensitivity, and
checkpoint defects of rad9-null mutant cells.

On immunoblots of mammalian cell extracts, Volkmer and Karnitz (1999)
found that human RAD9 migrated at 70 kD, even though it has a predicted
molecular mass of 45 kD. The authors attributed this discrepancy to
complex posttranslational modifications. In vivo, the human RAD9 protein
was phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, suggesting that it
participates in a DNA damage-inducible signaling pathway.
Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the fully modified form of
RAD9 interacts selectively with RAD1 (603153) and HUS1 in a stable
complex. Volkmer and Karnitz (1999) concluded that these 3 proteins are
central components of a DNA damage-responsive protein complex in human
cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by analysis of somatic cell
hybrids, Lieberman et al. (1996) mapped the RAD9 gene to 11q13.1-q13.2.
They found that the 3-prime end of the RAD9 cDNA contains sequences from
the 3-prime untranslated region of PPP1CA (176875), indicating that the
2 genes are transcribed in opposite orientations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Maniwa et al. (2005) found that a functional human RAD9 protein
accumulated in the nuclei of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (211980)
cells. Maniwa et al. (2006) examined the RAD9 sequence in tumor and
peripheral normal lung tissues, and the expression of its mRNA using
RT-PCR. No sequence alterations were detected in the RAD9 gene, which
was found to be normally transcribed in surgically resected lung
carcinoma cells. However, in 8 (16%) cases a SNP was observed at the
second position of codon 239 (his/arg heterozygous variant) of the gene.
This frequency was significantly higher than that found in the normal
population.

602139	TITLE *602139 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 7; NDUFA7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See NDUFA2 (602137). By a combination of EST database searching and PCR,
Loeffen et al. (1998) isolated human cDNAs encoding NDUFA7 and 7 other
complex I subunits. The predicted 113-amino acid human protein is 89%
identical to B14.5A, the bovine homolog. Hydropathy analysis revealed
that NDUFA7 and 4 other subunits have an overall hydrophilic pattern,
even though they are found within the hydrophobic protein (HP) fraction
of complex I. See NDUFA10 (603835).

MAPPING

By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and Brookes (1998)
assigned the NDUFA7 gene to 19p13.2. Although Dunbar et al. (1997) had
mapped the NDUFA7 gene to 20p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH), Emahazion and Brookes (1998) stated that subsequent mapping
studies with subfragments of the FISH-mapped recombinants of Dunbar et

were flawed.

605523	TITLE *605523 TRANSDUCER OF ERBB2, 1; TOB1
;;TOB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matsuda et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA encoding TOB1, which they called
TOB, a protein that interacts with the ERBB2 (164870) gene product p185.
Sequence analysis revealed that TOB1 is a 45-kD, 345-amino acid protein
whose N-terminal half is homologous to the antiproliferative gene
product BTG1 (109580). The C-terminal half of TOB1 is characterized by
the presence of a proline- and glutamine-rich sequence. Expression of
TOB1 mRNA was observed in various cell types.

GENE FUNCTION

Matsuda et al. (1996) found that, like BTG1, exogenously expressed TOB1
was able to suppress growth of NIH 3T3 cells, but the growth suppression
was hampered by the presence of kinase-active p185. By using GST-TOB1
proteins containing either full-length TOB1 or the N-terminal half of
TOB1, Matsuda et al. (1996) showed that the C-terminal half of TOB1 was
relevant to its interaction with p185. Furthermore, TOB1 could be
coimmunoprecipitated with anti-ERBB2 antibody, and reciprocally, p185
could be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-TOB1 antibodies. These data
suggested that p185 negatively regulates the TOB1-mediated
antiproliferative pathway through its interaction with TOB1, resulting
possibly in growth stimulation by p185. Expression of TOB1 mRNA was not
correlated with expression of ERBB2, suggesting that other receptor-type
protein-tyrosine kinases are also involved in the TOB1-mediated
regulation of cell growth.

Tzachanis et al. (2001) used antigen-specific T-cell clones rendered
anergic by stimulation of T-cell receptor (see 186810) in the absence of
costimulation or interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) and suppression subtractive
hybridization and differential screening to identify genes selectively
expressed in anergic cells. TOB was constitutively expressed in primary
peripheral blood T lymphocytes and had to be downregulated for T-cell
activation. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and gel-shift analyses
showed that TOB interacts with SMAD4 (MADH4; 600093) and, to a lesser
degree, with SMAD2 (601366) and augments SMAD DNA binding to sites in
the IL2 promoter, leading to an inhibition of IL2 transcription.
Tzachanis et al. (2001) concluded that T-cell quiescence is an actively
maintained phenotype that must be suppressed to allow T-cell activation
to occur, suggesting targets for the manipulation of the immune
response.

Xiong et al. (2006) found that zebrafish Tob1a was required for correct
dorsoventral patterning. Tob1a inhibited beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
transcriptional activity by physically associating with beta-catenin and
preventing formation of beta-catenin/Lef1 (153245) complexes. Although
Tob1a also inhibited the transcriptional activity of Smad3 (603109), its
role in limiting dorsal development was executed primarily by
antagonizing the beta-catenin signal. By immunoprecipitation analysis,
Xiong et al. (2006) showed that endogenous TOB1 and beta-catenin
interacted in human HEK293T cells. SMAD3 also immunoprecipitated with
TOB1 in human cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Matsuda et al. (1996) mapped the TOB1 gene to 17q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoshida et al. (2000) showed that murine Tob is a negative regulator of
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112265)/SMAD signaling in
osteoblasts. Mice carrying a targeted deletion of the Tob gene had a
greater bone mass due to increased numbers of osteoblasts. Orthotopic
bone formation in response to Bmp2 (112261) was elevated in
Tob-deficient mice. Overproduction of Tob repressed Bmp2-induced,
Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. Tob associated with
receptor-regulated Smads, including Smad1 (601595), Smad5 (603110), and
Smad8 (603295), and colocalized with these SMADs in the nuclear bodies
upon BMP2 stimulation. The results indicated that Tob negatively
regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by suppressing
the activity of the receptor-regulated Smad proteins.

601710	TITLE *601710 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5; EIF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5 (EIF5) interacts with the 40S
initiation complex to promote hydrolysis of bound GTP with concomitant
joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 40S initiation complex. The
resulting functional 80S ribosomal initiation complex is then active in
peptidyl transfer and chain elongations (summary by Si et al., 1996).

CLONING

Si et al. (1996) cloned the gene encoding human EIF5. The gene encodes a
predicted 431-amino acid polypeptide that shares significant homology
with the rat sequence. The authors also characterized multiple mRNAs
expressed from the rat EIF5 gene and found that they differ only in the
lengths of their 3-prime untranslated regions. The transcript length
variations are tissue specific and arise from use of alternative
polyadenylation signals.

GENE FUNCTION

Das et al. (2001) characterized recombinant rat Eif5. They identified an
N-terminal GTPase-activating domain in addition to the C-terminal
Eif2-beta (EIF2S2; 603908)-binding region. Mutation analysis revealed 1
critical arginine and 2 critical lysine residues near the N terminus
that were essential for Eif5 function. Das et al. (2001) concluded that
Eif5 functions as a GTPase-activating protein.

EIF5 functions in start site selection as a GTPase accelerating protein
(GAP) for the EIF2-GTP-tRNAi(Met) ternary complex within the
ribosome-bound preinitiation complex (summary by Jennings and Pavitt,
2010). Jennings and Pavitt (2010) defined new regulatory functions of
EIF5 in the recycling of EIF2 from its inactive EIF2-GDP state between
successive rounds of translation initiation. First, the authors showed
that EIF5 stabilizes the binding of GDP to EIF2 and is therefore a
bifunctional protein that acts as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI).
Jennings and Pavitt (2010) found that this activity is independent of
the GAP function and identified conserved residues within EIF5 that are
necessary for this role. In addition, Jennings and Pavitt (2010) showed
that EIF5 is a critical component of the EIF2(alpha-P) regulatory
complex that inhibits the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange
factor (GEF) EIF2B (603908). Jennings and Pavitt (2010) concluded that
their findings defined a new step in the translation initiation pathway,
one that is critical for normal translational controls.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the EIF5 gene to chromosome 14q32.32 based on an
alignment of the EIF5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK U494936) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

116805	TITLE *116805 CATENIN, ALPHA-1; CTNNA1
;;ALPHA-E-CATENIN;;
CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein responsible for physical
connection of epithelial cells through Ca(2+)-binding regions in its
extracellular domain. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is effected
by 3 cytoplasmic proteins known as catenins alpha, beta (see 116806),
and gamma. These catenins are thought to work as connectors that anchor
the E-cadherin to the cytoskeletal actin bundle through the cadherin
cytoplasmic domain. Dysfunction of this adhesion complex causes
dissociation of cancer cells from primary tumor nodules, thus possibly
contributing to cancer invasion and metastasis. Herrenknecht et al.
(1991) and Nagafuchi et al. (1991) isolated a murine cDNA encoding the
102-kD alpha-catenin (CAP102). Oda et al. (1993) cloned and sequenced
human alpha-catenin. They found that it shows extensive homology with
that of the mouse. Hirano et al. (1992) and Shimoyama et al. (1992)
showed that a human lung cancer cell line, PC9, which expresses
E-cadherin but only a small quantity of abnormal-sized alpha-catenin,
grew initially as isolated cells and then regained its cell-cell
adhesion potential when transfected with alpha-catenin. Oda et al.
(1993) found 2 abnormal mRNA sequences of alpha-catenin in PC9; one was
a 957-bp deletion resulting in a 319-amino acid deletion and another was
a 761-bp deletion resulting in a frameshift. The deletions were thought
to be responsible for the loss of alpha-catenin expression.

Furukawa et al. (1994) determined that the CTNNA1 gene encodes 906 amino
acids. The 102-kD predicted protein is the same size as the murine
homolog, and the amino acid sequences of the 2 proteins are 99.2%
homologous. Analysis by reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that the
gene is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues. The gene is expressed
as a 3.4-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Vasioukhin et al. (2001) examined the consequences of alpha-catenin
protein ablation in otherwise normal newborn mice. When surface
epithelium alpha-catenin was ablated, hair follicle development was
blocked and epidermal morphogenesis was dramatically affected, with
defects in adherens junction formation, intercellular adhesion, and
epithelial polarity. Differentiation occurred, but epidermis displayed
hyperproliferation, suprabasal mitoses, and multinucleated cells. In
vitro, alpha-catenin null keratinocytes were poorly contact inhibited
and grew rapidly. These differences were not dependent upon
intercellular adhesion and were in marked contrast to keratinocytes
conditionally null for another essential intercellular adhesion protein,
desmoplakin (DSP; 125647). Knockout keratinocytes exhibited sustained
activation of the Ras-MAPK cascade due to aberrations in growth factor
responses. The authors concluded that features of precancerous lesions
often attributed to defects in cell cycle regulatory genes can be
generated by compromising the function of alpha-catenin.

Van Aken et al. (2002) studied the cadherin-catenin complex in
retinoblastoma and normal retina tissues. In both cases, they found that
N-cadherin (114020) was associated with alpha- and beta-catenin but not
with E- or P-cadherin. Moreover, retinoblastoma cells, in contrast with
normal retina, expressed an N-cadherin/catenin complex that was
irregularly distributed and weakly linked to the cytoskeleton. In
retinoblastoma, this complex acted as an invasion promoter.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furukawa et al. (1994) showed that the CTNNA1 gene consists of 16 coding
exons and at least one 5-prime noncoding exon.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

In adherens junctions, alpha-catenin links the cadherin/beta-catenin
complex to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Alpha-catenin is a homodimer in
solution, but forms a 1:1 heterodimer with beta-catenin. Pokutta and
Weis (2000) determined the crystal structure of the alpha-catenin
dimerization domain, residues 82 to 279. The crystal structure showed
that alpha-catenin dimerizes through formation of a 4-helix bundle in
which 2 antiparallel helices are contributed by each protomer. A
slightly larger fragment, containing residues 57 to 264, bound to
beta-catenin. The crystal structure of a chimera consisting of the
alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the N terminus of
alpha-catenin residues 57 to 264 revealed the interaction between alpha-
and beta-catenin and provided a basis for understanding adherens
junction assembly.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Furukawa et al. (1994) mapped the
CTNNA1 gene to 5q31.

McPherson et al. (1994) sequenced partial alpha-catenin cDNAs from a
human prostate cDNA library and used these data to map the CTNNA1 gene
by PCR analysis of a panel of somatic cell hybrids carrying various
deletions. They concluded that the gene was located in the segment
between mid 5q21 and distal 5q22. The discrepancy was resolved by Nollet
et al. (1995), who characterized a catenin processed pseudogene
(CTNNAP1) which shows 90% nucleotide sequence identity to the catenin
functional gene (CTNNA1). The authors mapped the pseudogene to 5q22 and
the functional gene to 5q31 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Guenet et al. (1995) mapped the corresponding mouse gene (symbolized
Catna1) to chromosome 18 by analysis of the segregation pattern of
informative DNA polymorphisms among the progeny of 2 interspecific
backcrosses.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Interstitial deletion of all or part of chromosome 5q is a frequent
clonal chromosomal abnormality in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using primitive leukemia-initiating
cells from individuals with MDS or AML, with or without a chromosome 5q
deletion, Liu et al. (2007) analyzed the expression of 12 genes within
the 5q31 common deleted region and found that CTNNA1 was expressed at a
much lower level in cells from individuals with a 5q deletion than in
cells from those without a 5q deletion or in normal hematopoietic cells.
Analysis of HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells with deletion of the 5q31
region showed that the CTNNA1 promoter of the retained allele was
suppressed by both methylation and histone deacetylation. Restoration of
CTNNA1 expression in HL-60 cells resulted in reduced proliferation and
apoptotic cell death. Liu et al. (2007) concluded that loss of the
CTNNA1 tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic stem cells may provide a
growth advantage that contributes to human MDS/AML with 5q deletion.

Ding et al. (2010) described the genomic analyses of 4 DNA samples from
an African American patient with basal-like breast cancer: peripheral
blood, the primary tumor, a brain metastasis, and a xenograft derived
from the primary tumor. The metastasis contained 2 de novo mutations and
a large deletion not present in the primary tumor, and was significantly
enriched for 20 shared mutations. The xenograft retained all primary
tumor mutations and displayed a mutation enrichment pattern that
resembled the metastasis. Two overlapping large deletions encompassing
CTNNA1 were present in all 3 tumor samples. The differential mutation
frequencies and structural variation patterns in metastasis and
xenograft compared with the primary tumor indicated that secondary
tumors may arise from a minority of cells with the primary tumor.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lien et al. (2006) found that neural progenitors express alpha-E catenin
while differentiated neurons express alpha-N catenin (114025). To study
the role of alpha-E catenin in the central nervous system (CNS), Lien et
al. (2006) created CNS-specific deletion of alpha-E catenin.
Heterozygotes were similar to wildtype littermates. At embryonic day
12.5 alpha-E catenin-null mice were indistinguishable from their
littermates, but by embryonic day 13.5 mutant brains displayed a 40%
increase in total cell numbers. At birth, these pups were born with
small bodies and enlarged heads; after birth the heads of these animals
continued to grow but their bodies were developmentally retarded. Pups
failed to thrive and died between 2 and 3 weeks of age. Histologic
analysis of alpha-E catenin-null brains revealed severe dysplasia and
hyperplasia. The ventricular zone cells were dispersed throughout the
developing brains, forming invasive tumor-like masses that displayed
widespread pseudopalisading and the formation of rosettes similar to
Homer-Wright rosettes in human medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma,
retinoblastoma, pineoblastoma, neurocytoma, and pineocytoma tumors.
Alpha-E catenin-null embryos had a prominent increase in the thickness
and size of the cerebral cortex. There was massive expansion of
dysplastic cortical progenitor cells, causing a posterior and ventral
shift in localization of the lateral ventricle. Lien et al. (2006) found
that the hyperplasia in alpha-E catenin-null brains was the combined
outcome of the shortening of the cell cycle and decreased apoptosis in
neural progenitor cells. Using a microarray approach, Lien et al. (2006)
determined that only 5 transcripts were upregulated and 3 downregulated
in alpha-E catenin-null brains. The 2 most upregulated cDNAs, Fgf15 (see
603891) and Gli1 (165220), are transcriptional targets of the hedgehog
(see 600725) pathway. Quantitative RT-PCR showed significant
upregulation of Gli1, Fgf15, and Smoothened (601500). Lien et al. (2006)
proposed that alpha-E catenin connects cell density-dependent adherens
junctions with the developmental hedgehog pathway and that this
connection may provide a negative feedback loop controlling the size of
developing cerebral cortex.

Shibata et al. (2007) generated several familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP; 175100) mouse lines heterozygous for a ser580-to-asp (S580D)
truncation mutation in the Apc gene (611731) and found that 1 line (line
19) showed reduced incidence of intestinal adenomas (less than 5%
compared with other lines). They identified a deletion in the Ctnna1
gene as the cause of tumor suppression in line-19 Apc S580D/+ mice and
found that suppression only occurred when the Ctnna1 deletion was in cis
configuration with the Apc S580D mutation. In all adenomas generated in
line-19 Apc S580D/+ mice, somatic recombination between Apc and Ctnna1
retained the wildtype Ctnna1 allele. Shibata et al. (2007) concluded
that simultaneous inactivation of Ctnna1 and Apc during tumor initiation
suppressed adenoma formation in line-19 Apc S580D/+ mice, suggesting
that CTNNA1 plays an essential role in initiation of intestinal
adenomas. They noted that evidence from human colon tumors with invasive
or metastatic potential had established a tumor-suppressive role for
CTNNA1 in late-stage tumorigenesis. Thus, Shibata et al. (2007)
suggested that CTNNA1 has dual roles in intestinal tumorigenesis: a
supporting role in tumor initiation and a suppressive role in tumor
progression.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The VPREB (605141) and IGLL1 (lambda-5) genes encode the iota and omega
polypeptide chains, respectively (Pillai and Baltimore, 1988), which
associate with the immunoglobulin (Ig) mu chain to form a molecular
complex that is expressed on the surface of pre-B cells. This complex
presumably regulates Ig gene rearrangements in the early steps of B-cell
differentiation.

CLONING

In the mouse, the VpreB and lambda-5 genes are simultaneously expressed
in pre-B cells, are only 4.6 kb apart, and belong to the same
transcription unit. A primary transcript is synthesized from which the
pre-B and lambda-5 mRNAs are derived by alternative splicing. In the
human, however, Mattei et al. (1991) concluded that the 2 genes,
designated VPREB1 and IGLL1, are separate.

Schiff et al. (1989) isolated clones from a human fetal liver cDNA
library that were only 85% homologous to the functional C-lambda genes
(IGLC; 147220) and showed that they represent additional nonallelic
members of a C-lambda-like family. Using pulsed field gel
electrophoresis, the genes were shown to be present on a 200-kb DNA
fragment, distinct from the C-lambda cluster. A splicing event accounted
for differences between the 2 cDNAs.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Mattei et al. (1991) demonstrated that the
pre-B-specific lambda-like cluster is located in the 22q11.2-q12.3
region, distal to the IgC lambda locus.

- Pseudogene

Linnebank et al. (2002) stated that a gene on 22q11.2 thought to
represent a pseudogene of the argininosuccinate lyase gene (ASL; 608310)
on 7cen-q11.2 may in fact be a gene coding for
immunoglobulin-lambda-like mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

B-cell precursors transiently express a pre-B cell receptor complex
consisting of a rearranged mu heavy chain, a surrogate light chain
composed of lambda-5/14.1 and VpreB, and the immunoglobulin-associated
signal transducing chains, Ig-alpha and Ig-beta (Minegishi et al.,
1998).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with agammaglobulinemia and markedly reduced numbers of B cells
(AGM2; 613500), Minegishi et al. (1998) identified mutations on both
alleles of the gene encoding lambda-5/14.1 (146770.0001; 146770.0002).
The maternal allele carried a premature stop codon in the first exon of
the gene and the paternal allele demonstrated 3-bp substitutions in a
33-bp sequence in exon 3. The 3 substitutions corresponded to the
sequence in the lambda-5/14.1 pseudogene 16.1 and resulted in an amino
acid substitution at an invariant proline. When expressed in COS cells,
the allele carrying the pseudogene sequence resulted in defective
folding and secretion of mutant lambda-5/14.1. These findings indicated
that expression of the functional lambda-5/14.1 is critical for B-cell
development in the human.

IGLL1, GLN22TER

In a boy with agammaglobulinemia and markedly reduced numbers of B cells
(AGM2; 613500), Minegishi et al. (1998) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the IGLL1 gene: on 1 allele, a C-to-T
transition at codon 22 of exon 1, resulting in a gln22-to-ter (Q22X)
substitution; on the other allele, 3 basepair substitutions, T-to-C at
nucleotide 393 (codon 131), T-to-C at nucleotide 420 (codon 140), and
C-to-T at nucleotide 425 (codon 142). The first 2 substitutions did not
change the coding sequence; however, the third resulted in replacement
of the wildtype proline with leucine (P142L; 146770.0002). The proline
at this site, which occurs in the loop linking the second and third
strands of 1 of the 2 beta pleated sheets that compose the
immunoglobulin domain, is conserved not only in lambda constant region
domains in all species evaluated, but also in most immunoglobulin
domains. The 3 substitutions corresponded to the sequence in a lambda-5
pseudogene. When expressed in COS cells, the allele carrying the
pseudogene sequence resulted in defective folding and secretion of
mutant lambda-5/14.1.

CAPILLARY MORPHOGENESIS GENE 1; CMG1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display and library screening to identify genes
upregulated during capillary morphogenesis, Bell et al. (2001) cloned
CMG1 from an umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library. The deduced
600-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 65 kD. CMG1
contains a coiled-coil domain and several putative phosphorylation
sites. The coiled-coil domain shares 24% identity with myosin heavy
chain (see 160730) sequences from various species. RT-PCR detected
highest expression in adult and fetal kidney and lower expression in
adult heart, placenta, lung, liver, and pancreas, and in fetal heart,
lung, and liver. Little to no expression was detected in adult brain and
skeletal muscle or in fetal brain, thymus, and spleen. Transfection into
epithelial tumor cells revealed targeting of fluorescent-tagged CMG1 to
an intracellular vesicular compartment.

GENE FUNCTION

Bell et al. (2001) determined that CMG1 was 1 of several transcripts
upregulated by umbilical vein endothelial cells during capillary
morphogenesis in 3-dimensional collagen matrices.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bell et al. (2001) mapped the CMG1 gene to
chromosome 9q.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using short hairpin RNAs, Ezratty et al. (2011) found that knockdown of
Ift74 expression in embryonic day-9.5 mice enhanced proliferation and
expansion of basal keratinocyte-like cells, reduced Notch (see 190198)
reporter activity, and caused a loss of cilia in epidermal keratinocytes
in day-15.5 embryos. Cilia loss occurred in both undifferentiated basal
keratinocytes and differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes.
