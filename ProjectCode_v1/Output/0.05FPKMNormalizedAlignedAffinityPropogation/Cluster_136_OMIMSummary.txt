604135	TITLE *604135 NUCLEAR FACTOR ERYTHROID 2-LIKE 3; NFE2L3
;;NFE2-RELATED FACTOR 3; NRF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NFE2-binding sites and Maf recognition elements (MAREs) are essential
cis-acting elements in the regulatory regions of erythroid-specific
genes recognized by the erythroid transcription factor NFE2, which is
composed of p45 (NFE2; 601490) and a small MAF protein (e.g., MAFK;
600197). The p45 subunit and p45-related factors, such as NFE2L3,
contain a cap'n'collar (CNC)-type basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain and
are collectively grouped as the CNC family. CNC factors bind to MARE
through heterodimer formation with small Maf proteins (summary by
Kobayashi et al., 1999).

CLONING

Kobayashi et al. (1999) searched a human EST database for novel CNC
factors and identified an EST clone encoding an amino acid sequence
similar to that of NRF1 (NFE2L1; 163260). They isolated cDNAs
corresponding to this EST by screening a human placenta cDNA library
with the EST. The cDNA sequence encodes a 694-amino acid polypeptide,
NFE2L3, which the authors called NRF3. NRF3 contains a bZIP domain that
is similar to those of other CNC transcription factors. Northern blot
analysis detected 2 human NRF3 transcripts in all tissues examined, with
the highest levels in placenta. NRF3 was expressed in B-cell and
monocytic cell lines but not in T-cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Kobayashi et al. (1999) demonstrated that mouse Nrf3 could bind to a
MARE as a heterodimer with Mafk and that Nrf3 functioned as a
transcriptional activator.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kobayashi et al. (1999) mapped the NFE2L3 gene to chromosome
7p15-p14, near the HOXA gene cluster (see 142955).

ANIMAL MODEL

Chevillard et al. (2011) stated that Nrf3 deletion in mice causes no
obvious abnormalities. However, they found that Nrf3 -/- mice were more
sensitive than wildtype mice to the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene, which is
found in cigarette smoke. Benzo(a)pyrene, delivered weekly by gavage
over 4 weeks, caused premature death in 6 (32%) of 19 of Nrf3 -/- mice,
but in only 1 (6%) of 16 wildtype animals. All Nrf3 -/- animals that
died had lymphomas originating mostly from thymus, with a few
originating from spleen, and a majority exhibited metastasis to the
lung. Chevillard et al. (2011) concluded that NRF3 is a tumor suppressor
transcription factor that is protective against hematopoietic
malignancies.

615323	TITLE *615323 JOSEPHIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; JOSD1
;;KIAA0063
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

JOSD1 belongs to a family of Josephin domain-containing deubiquitinating
enzymes related to ATXN3 (607047). JOSD1 is activated by
monoubiquitination and functions in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell
motility, and endocytosis (Seki et al., 2013).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 human
immature myeloid cell line cDNA library, (Nomura et al., 1994) obtained
a partial JOSD1 clone, which they designated KIAA0063. The 3-prime
untranslated region contains an Alu element and its 202-amino acid
sequence was predicted to include a transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis detected JOSD1 in all human tissues and cell lines examined.

Seki et al. (2013) stated that the deduced 202-amino acid JOSD1 protein
is made up almost entirely of an approximately 180-amino acid Josephin
catalytic domain, including a catalytic cys36. Western blot analysis
detected robust Josd1 expression in all mouse tissues examined: anterior
and posterior brain, heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, and spleen.
In transfected HEK293 cells, epitope- or fluorescence-tagged JOSD1
localized predominantly at the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic puncta.
In fractionated cells, JOSD1 localized to the cytoskeletal, cytosolic,
and membrane fractions, but not to the nuclear fraction. Database
analysis revealed 2 JOSD genes in vertebrates, JOSD1 and JOSD2 (615324),
but only a single Josd gene in C. elegans and Drosophila.

GENE FUNCTION

Seki et al. (2013) found that recombinant human JOSD1 deubiquitinated a
monoubiquitinated probe. However, monoubiquitinated JOSD1 showed
activity against both lys48- and lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains,
which are associated with protein degradative and regulatory pathways,
respectively. A substantial proportion of JOSD1 appeared to be
monoubiquitinated in cultured cells. In contrast, JOSD2 did not require
monoubiquitination for activity against either lys48- or lys63-linked
ubiquitin chains. Monoubiquitination of JOSD1 caused its relocalization
from the cytoskeletal fraction to the membrane fraction in transfected
cells. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that catalytically inactive JOSD1
altered membrane dynamics and cell motility; monoubiquitinated and
catalytic active JOSD1 also enhanced macropinocytosis and suppressed
clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Seki et al. (2013)
concluded that the activity of JOSD1 is regulated by monoubiquitination
and that it has a role in membrane dynamics and endocytosis.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the
JOSD1 gene to chromosome 22. Hartz (2013) mapped the JOSD1 gene to
chromosome 22q13.1 based on an alignment of the JOSD1 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK D31884) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601012	TITLE *601012 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, N TYPE, ALPHA-1B SUBUNIT; CACNA1B
;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, ALPHA-1 POLYPEPTIDE, ISOFORM 5; CACNL1A5;;
CaV2.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are multisubunit complexes found in
the membrane of many excitable cells that regulate calcium entry (see
601011). N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmitter release
from neurons, are dihydropyridine-insensitive and
omega-conotoxin-sensitive. The alpha-1 subunit forms the pore through
which calcium enters the cell, and is encoded by a family of at least 5
genes.

CLONING

Williams et al. (1992) cloned the neuronal alpha-1B subunit by probing
brain cDNA libraries with a rabbit probe. RT-PCR revealed 2
alternatively spliced isoforms, encoding predicted products of 2,339
(alpha-1B-1) and 2,237 (alpha-1B-2) amino acids, with 64% and 73%
identity to the rabbit gene product, respectively. Both isoforms are
transcribed only in central nervous system tissue.

MAPPING

Diriong et al. (1995) and Kim et al. (1997) mapped the CACNA1B gene to
chromosome 9q34 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Williams et al. (1992) used transient expression studies in HEK293 cells
to demonstrate that CACNA1B had N-type calcium channel activity.

Using binding and immunoprecipitation assays on adult rat cortical
tissue, Maeno-Hikichi et al. (2003) showed that the enigma-like LIM
domain protein (ENH; 605904) interacts specifically with protein kinase
C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) and the C terminus of CACNA1B to form a
macromolecular complex. Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes indicated
that expression of ENH resulted in increased rapid and specific
modulation of N-type calcium channels by PKCE. The authors concluded
that through interactions with a common adaptor protein, the formation
of a kinase-substrate complex is the molecular basis for the specificity
and efficiency of cellular signaling.

The CaV2.2 calcium channel interacts with and is modulated by CRMP2
(602463). Overexpression of CRMP2 leads to increased surface expression
of CaV2.2 on neurons, enhanced calcium currents, and an increase in
stimulated release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP; 114130) from dorsal root ganglia (summary by Brittain et al.,
2011).

ANIMAL MODEL

Kim et al. (2001) found that CaV2.2-null mice were viable and fertile
and showed normal motor coordination. CaV2.2-null mice exhibited reduced
responses to certain pain stimuli, suggesting that CaV2.2 plays a role
in pain perception at the spinal level, but not at the supraspinal
level.

Kim et al. (2009) observed elevated aggression in CaV2.2-null mice.
CaV2.2 is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus of adult rats,
and injection of an N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker into the dorsal raphe
nucleus of wildtype mice resulted in increased aggressive behavior. Kim
et al. (2009) concluded that N-type Ca(2+) channels in the dorsal raphe
nucleus have a role in the control of aggression.

In rats, Brittain et al. (2011) demonstrated that inflammatory and
neuropathic hypersensitivity can be suppressed by a synthetic 15-mer
peptide (CBD3) that uncouples Crmp2 and CaV2.2 calcium channels in
neurons. Studies in cultured neurons and spinal cord slices showed that
CBD3 peptide bound CaV2.2, interfered with the interaction of Crmp2 and
CaV2.2, and reduced channel function, as evidenced by decreased CGRP
neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and decreased excitatory
synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons. In rats, treatment with
CBD3 also reduced meningeal blood flow and reduced nocifensive behavior
induced by peripheral formalin injection or corneal capsaicin
application, as well as reversed neuropathic hypersensitivity produced
by an antiretroviral drug. The peptide was mildly anxiolytic without
affecting memory retrieval, sensorimotor function or depression.

PROGESTIN-INDUCED PROTEIN;;

KIAA0896
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from an adult brain cDNA library, Nagase
et al. (1998) cloned KIAA0896. The deduced protein contains 1,230 amino
acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected expression in all tissues and specific
brain regions examined. Highest expression was in ovary, thalamus, and
spinal cord, and lowest expression was in pancreas and spleen.

By differential display to identify progestin-induced genes expressed in
breast cancer cells, followed by 5-prime RACE and screening of heart and
placenta cDNA libraries, Callaghan et al. (1998) cloned EDD (E3
identified by differential display). The deduced 2,799-amino acid
protein contains 2 putative nuclear localization signals, a region
sharing homology with polyadenylate-binding proteins (see 604679), and a
C-terminal HECT domain, which contains a conserved cysteine that binds
ubiquitin via a thioester linkage. Northern blot analysis detected a
9.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis found
highest expression in testis, followed by brain, pituitary, and kidney.
Western blot of in vitro-translated EDD detected a protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 300 kD.

In addition to the domains identified by Callaghan et al. (1998) in EDD,
Henderson et al. (2002) identified an N-terminal ubiquitin-associated
(UBA) domain, a central UBR1 (605981)-like zinc finger motif, and a
third putative nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis, Callaghan et al. (1998) demonstrated that
expression of EDD was enhanced in breast cancer cells following exposure
to a synthetic progestin. Inhibitors of both transcription and
translation could block the induction of EDD. In vitro, EDD reversibly
bound ubiquitin through a cysteine residue within the conserved
C-terminal HECT domain.

Honda et al. (2002) found that HYD bound to the C-terminal BRCA1
(113705) domains of DNA topoisomerase-binding protein-1 (TOPBP1;
607760). Several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UBCH4, UBCH5B (602962),
and UBCH5C (602963), transferred ubiquitin molecules to HYD, leading to
ubiquitination of TOPBP1. Honda et al. (2002) concluded that HYD is a
ubiquitin ligase.

Henderson et al. (2002) showed that EDD interacted with importin alpha-5
(600686) through 2 consensus basic nuclear localization signals in its N
terminus and was localized in cell nuclei. EDD also bound progesterone
receptor (PGR; 607311) and potentiated progestin-mediated gene
transactivation. The interaction with PGR did not require the LxxLL
receptor-binding motif of EDD. EDD also bound calcium- and
integrin-binding protein/DNA-dependent protein kinase-interacting
protein (KIP; 602293), and the interaction between EDD and KIP was
altered in response to DNA damage.

By analyzing several cancers of diverse tissue origin, Clancy et al.
(2003) found that allelic imbalance at the EDD locus was common in
several carcinomas. The EDD gene was also frequently overexpressed in
breast and ovarian cancers.

Okamoto et al. (2013) addressed the molecular properties of TRF2
(602027) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome
ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and stated that their data
supported a 2-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First,
the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM (607585)
activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA
damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the
propagation of DNA damage signaling downstream of ATM activation. This
novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (612688). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres
involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 (300617) and the ubiquitin
ligase UBR5, and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end
fusions. Okamoto et al. (2013) concluded that this 2-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection helped to explain the apparent paradox of
frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without
concurrent induction of detrimental DNA repair activities.

MAPPING

By FISH, Callaghan et al. (1998) mapped the EDD1 gene to chromosome
8q22.3.

;;C6.1A;;
BRCC36
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kenwrick et al., 1992 identified cDNA clones corresponding to the BRCC3
and MTCP1 (300116) genes, which they called C6.1A and C6.1B,
respectively. The C6.1A gene was highly conserved between species and
expressed abundantly in many human and mouse tissues.

Dong et al. (2003) determined that the BRCC3 gene encodes a 316-amino
acid protein with a molecular mass of 36 kD. BRCC3 shares sequence
homology with the JAMM domain of POH1 (PSMD14; 607173) and COPS5
(604850).

GENE FUNCTION

Dong et al. (2003) demonstrated that in human cell lines BRCC3 and BRE
(610497) are components of a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2 (600185), BARD1 (601593), and RAD51 (179617), which they
called the BRCA1- and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex
showed UBC5 (see UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.
Inclusion of BRE and BRCC3 enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that BRCC
is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following DNA
damage.

Okamoto et al. (2013) addressed the molecular properties of TRF2
(602027) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome
ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and stated that their data
supported a 2-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First,
the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM (607585)
activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA
damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the
propagation of DNA damage signaling downstream of ATM activation. This
novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (612688). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres
involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5
(608413), and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions.
Okamoto et al. (2013) concluded that this 2-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection helped to explain the apparent paradox of
frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without
concurrent induction of detrimental DNA repair activities.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Kenwrick et al. (1992) mapped the BRCC3
gene to chromosome Xq28.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with an X-linked recessive
syndromic form of moyamoya disease (MYMY4; 300845), Miskinyte et al.
(2011) identified 3 different deletions on chromosome Xq28. The critical
region of overlap was a 3.4-kb region including exon 1 of the
MTCP1/MTCP1NB gene (300116) and the first 3 exons of the BRCC3 gene,
resulting in loss of BRCC3 and MTCP1NB expression in patient
lymphoblastoid cell lines. Morpholino knockdown of Brcc3 in zebrafish
resulted in defective angiogenesis that could be rescued by endothelial
expression of Brcc3, suggesting that loss of BRCC3 function was
responsible for the human disorder. The phenotype is a multisystem
disorder characterized by moyamoya disease, short stature,
hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and facial dysmorphism. Other variable
features include dilated cardiomyopathy and premature graying of the
hair. Miskinyte et al. (2011) noted that some of the features of the
disorder were reminiscent of chromosome breakage syndromes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TCF3 gene, also called E2A, encodes 2 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factors, E12 and E47, through alternative splicing. E12
and E47 are involved in regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression
(Bain et al., 1994).

CLONING

Expression of immunoglobulin genes depends on various sequence motifs in
their enhancer and promoter regions. One class of such sequences is the
E box, which is found in both heavy and light chain enhancers. The
kappa-E2 site has been shown to be important for light chain gene
transcription. To isolate cDNAs encoding kappa-E2-binding proteins,
Murre et al. (1989) screened a cDNA expression library derived from a
human B-cell lymphoma cell line (BJAB) with an oligonucleotide
containing a trimerized kappa-E2 site. They identified a partial cDNA
encoding a protein that they designated E12. Using the E12 cDNA to
rescreen the BJAB cDNA library, Murre et al. (1989) isolated a partial
cDNA encoding a protein that they designated E47. Sequence analysis
suggested that E12 and E47 are derived from a single gene, called E2A or
TCF3, via alternative splicing. E12 contains a leucine zipper; the
corresponding region of E47 was not cloned. Both the E12 and E47
proteins contain a region that is homologous to regions in MYOD
(159970), members of the MYC family (e.g., 190080), the Drosophila
'daughterless' gene product, and products of the Drosophila
'achaete-scute' and 'twist' gene families. The homologous regions have
the potential to form 2 amphipathic helices separated by an intervening
loop, and the hydrophobic residues present in the helices are highly
conserved.

Henthorn et al. (1990) independently cloned E2A and designated it ITF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Murre et al. (1989) showed that both E12 and E47 bound specifically to
the kappa-E2 sequence. They demonstrated that E47 bound kappa-E2 as a
dimer in vitro. Murre et al. (1989) demonstrated that the
helix-loop-helix motif of E12/E47 plays a crucial role in both
dimerization and DNA binding.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (101400) is an autosomal dominant
craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by premature fusion of coronal
sutures and limb abnormalities of variable severity. Mutations in TWIST
(601622), a class B basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor,
have been shown to be responsible for this phenotype. El Ghouzzi et al.
(2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to study interaction between TWIST
and E12, a potential partner in heterodimerization. Missense mutations
involving the helical domains of TWIST led to a complete loss of
heterodimerization with the E12 protein, and dramatically altered the
ability of the TWIST protein to localize in the nucleus of transfected
COS cells. The authors hypothesized that the E12-TWIST heterodimer may
serve as a negative regulator of transcription in osteoblastic cells.

TAL1 (187040) is necessary for establishment of the hematopoietic system
and can either activate or repress transcription depending upon other
factors recruited to TAL1-nucleated complexes. Goardon et al. (2006)
found that ETO2 (CBFA2T3; 603870) copurified with TAL1 complexes in
human and mouse erythroleukemia cells. Protein pull-down assays revealed
that ETO2 interacted with E2A and HEB (TCF12; 600480) within the TAL1
complex, but not with TAL1 itself. ETO2 also interacted with E2A in
erythroid cells independent of the TAL1 complex. Reporter gene assays
revealed that ETO2 repressed the transcriptional activity of the
complex. The ETO2 content in TAL1 complexes was high during the
proliferative phase in erythroid cells. In contrast, ETO2 was
downregulated upon terminal differentiation, concomitant with appearance
of histone modifications associated with gene activation and expression
of glycophorin A (GPA; 111300) and band 4.2 (EPB42; 177070), which are
markers of erythrocyte maturation. Knockdown of ETO2 via small
interfering RNA induced growth arrest and differentiation in human and
mouse erythroid progenitors. Goardon et al. (2006) concluded that ETO2
is required for expansion of erythroid progenitors, but that it is
dispensable for terminal maturation. They proposed that the
stoichiometry of ETO2 with the TAL1 complex controls the transition from
erythroid progenitor expansion to terminal differentiation.

The vitamin D receptor-interacting repressor (VDIR), a basic
helix-loop-helix transcription activator, regulates the transcription of
CYP27B1 (609506) by binding to the negative vitamin D response element
(nVDRE) in the CYP27B1 promoter (Kim et al., 2007).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization and Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic
cell hybrids, Mellentin et al. (1989) demonstrated that the E2A gene
maps to 19p13.3-p13.2, a site associated with nonrandom translocations
in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL; 613065). By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the TCF3 gene to 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in TCF3, IKZF1 (603023), IKZF3 (606221), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

CYTOGENETICS

Evidence presented by Mellentin et al. (1989) suggested that most, and
perhaps all, t(1;19)(q23;p13) chromosomal translocations, a frequent
cytogenetic change in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, contain
rearrangements of the E2A gene.

Hunger (1996) reviewed clinical features and the molecular pathogenesis
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) caused by chromosomal
translocations involving the E2A gene. E2A proteins play an
indispensable role in B-cell lymphopoiesis. The pathogenesis of a subset
of B-precursor ALLs involves replacement of the bHLH regions of the E2A
protein with heterologous DNA-binding domains.

- E2A/PBX1 Fusion Gene

Nourse et al. (1990) detected altered E2A transcripts, which lacked
sequences encoding the helix-loop-helix DNA-binding motif, in several
t(1;19)-carrying cell lines. They cloned fusion cDNAs that crossed the
t(1;19) breakpoint. These cDNAs encode an 85-kD protein consisting of
the N-terminal two-thirds of E2A fused to a chromosome 1-derived
protein. The fusion protein has the features of a chimeric transcription
factor in which the DNA-binding domain of E2A is replaced by the
putative DNA-binding domain of a homeoprotein from chromosome 1, which
Nourse et al. (1990) named PRL (PBX1; 176310) for 'pre-B cell leukemia.'
By PCR of 3 t(1;19)-carrying cell lines, the authors detected identical
E2A-PRL mRNA junctions, indicating that the fusion transcripts and
predicted chimeric protein are a consistent feature of this
translocation.

Kamps et al. (1990) found that a cell line with a t(1;19)(q23;p13.3)
translocation contains 2 novel chimeric mRNAs, both with the same
5-prime E2A sequences but with different lengths of 3-prime sequence
from a gene located on chromosome 1, which they called PRL (PBX1). The
chimeric RNAs encode proteins that lack 171 amino acids of E2A,
including its DNA-binding and dimerization motifs, but have instead a
homeobox-related sequence from PRL. Kamps et al. (1990) suggested that
the production of a chimeric E2A-PRL protein may contribute to the acute
lymphoblastic phenotype by directly altering the expression of genes
normally responsive to the PRL homeoprotein.

Wiemels et al. (2002) sequenced the genomic fusion between the E2A and
PBX1 genes in 22 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 2 cell lines.
The prenatal origin of the leukemia was assessed in 15 pediatric
patients by screening for the clonotypic E2A-PBX1 translocation in
neonatal blood spots, or Guthrie cards, obtained from the children at
birth. Two patients were weakly positive for the fusion at birth, in
contrast to previously studied childhood leukemia fusions, t(12;21),
t(8;21), and t(4;11), which are predominantly prenatal. The presence of
extensive N-nucleotides at the point of fusion in the E2A-PBX1
translocation as well as specific characteristics of the IGH
(147100)/TCR (see 186880) rearrangements provided additional evidence
for a postnatal, pre-B cell origin. Sixteen of 24 breakpoints on the
3.2-kb E2A intron 14 were located within 5 bp, providing evidence for a
site-specific recombination mechanism. Breakpoints on the 232-kb PBX1
intron 1 were more dispersed, but were highly clustered proximal to exon
2. Thus, the translocation breakpoints displayed evidence of unique
temporal, ontologic, and mechanistic formation in contrast to the
previously analyzed pediatric leukemia translocation breakpoints,
emphasizing the need to differentiate cytogenetic and molecular
subgroups for studies of leukemia causality.

- E2A/HLF Fusion Gene

Inaba et al. (1992) showed that a t(17;19) chromosomal translocation in
early B-lineage acute leukemia resulted in chimeric transcripts that
contained sequences from the E2A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factor gene on chromosome 19, fused to sequences from a
gene on chromosome 17 that encodes a hepatic leukemia factor (HLF;
142385). The chimeric protein consisted of the amino-terminal
transactivation domain of E2A linked to the carboxyl-terminal basic
region-leucine zipper domain of HLF.

Kurosawa et al. (1999) found that E2A/HLF upregulated expression of
SRPUL (SRPX2; 300642) and annexin-8 (ANXA8; 602396) in pro-B cells.
Transfection of a human myeloid leukemia cell line with E2A/HLF induced
expression of ANXA8, but not SRPUL. E2A/HLF protected mouse pro-B cells
from apoptosis caused by IL3 (147740) deprivation, but neither ANXA8 or
SRPUL could block apoptosis, suggesting that they are not involved in
malignant transformation.

Using representational difference analysis, Dang et al. (2001) found
that the E2A/HLF fusion protein upregulated expression of several
groucho-related genes (GRGs), including Grg2 and Grg6 (TLE6; 612399),
following expression in a mouse pro-B cell line. A mutant E2A/HLF
protein lacking DNA-binding activity also stimulated expression of GRGs.
Among the transcription factors that interact with GRG proteins, only
Runx1 (151385) was appreciably downregulated by E2A/HLF.

- E2A/TFPT Fusion Gene

Brambillasca et al. (1999) identified 4 cases of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia displaying E2A/FB1 (TFPT; 609519) chimeric transcripts that
appeared to originate from a cryptic rearrangement of chromosome 19. The
5-prime portion of E2A was interrupted at different positions within
exons 13 or 14 and fused to FB1. The fusion was in-frame in 1 case, and
the remaining cases showed out-of-frame fusions leading to stop codons
in FB1 or to truncation of the predicted chimeric product. Brambillasca
et al. (1999) found no evidence of reciprocal chimeric transcripts.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heterodimers between tissue-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
proteins and the products of the E2A gene play major roles in
determining tissue-specific cell fate. The E2A gene gives rise to 2
proteins, E12 and E47, by differential splicing of E12- and E47-specific
bHLH-encoding exons. Although they were initially identified in B cells
as immunoglobulin enhancer-binding proteins, they were subsequently
found to be present in most cell types. To understand the broad role of
E2A in development, Zhuang et al. (1994) generated E2A mutant mice
following homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous
mutant mice developed to full term without apparent abnormalities, but
then displayed a high rate of postnatal death. The surviving mice showed
retarded postnatal growth. Detailed examination of hematopoiesis
revealed that the homozygous mutant mice contained no B cells, whereas
other lineages, including the T cell, granulocyte, macrophage, and
erythroid lineages, were intact. The block to B-cell differentiation
occurred before the immunoglobulin gene D(H)-J(H) rearrangement.
Surprisingly, heterozygous embryos contained, on average, about half as
many B cells as did wildtype embryos, suggesting the existence of a
counting mechanism that translates levels of E2A into numbers of B
cells.

Sun (1994) generated transgenic mice in which the Id1 gene (600349) was
constitutively overexpressed in the B-cell lineage. The product of this
gene is an inhibitor of the DNA-binding activity of bHLH proteins such
as the E2A gene product. The phenotype of these transgenic mice depicted
severe defects in early B-cell development, suggesting that the bHLH
proteins play pivotal roles in B-cell development and that the
downregulation of Id1 gene expression is necessary for B cells to
differentiate.

Bain et al. (1994) likewise generated E2A-null mice by gene targeting
and found that they failed to generate mature B cells. The arrest of
B-cell development occurred at an early stage since no immunoglobulin DJ
rearrangements could be detected. The finding suggested a crucial role
for E2A products in the regulation of early B-cell differentiation.

To investigate the biologic role of the E2A-HLF fusion gene, Honda et
al. (1999) generated transgenic mice expressing E2A-HLF in the lymphoid
lineage. The transgenic mice exhibited abnormal development in the
thymus and spleen and were susceptible to infection. The thymus
contained small numbers of thymocytes and showed a high population of
thymocytes undergoing apoptosis. The spleen exhibited a marked reduction
in lymphocytes, and studies showed that B-cell maturation was blocked at
a very early developmental stage. Several transgenic mice developed
acute leukemia, classified as T-ALL. Smith et al. (1999) likewise
studied the function of the fusion gene in transgenic mice.
Approximately 60% of E2A-HLF mice developed lymphoid malignancies with a
mean latency of 10 months. Tumors were monoclonal, consistent with the
requirement for secondary genetic events. Smith et al. (1999) concluded
that the fusion gene disrupts the differentiation of T-lymphoid
precursors in vivo, leading to profound postnatal thymic depletion and
rendering B- and T-cell progenitors susceptible to malignant
transformation.

NOMENCLATURE

The TCF3 gene, also known as E2A, should not be confused with the the
TCF7L1 gene (604652), which was initially designated TCF3. TCF3 encodes
the bHLH transcription factors E12 and E47, whereas TCF7L1 encodes a
TCF/LEF transcription factor involved in Wnt (see 164820) signaling.

102680	TITLE *102680 ADDUCIN 1; ADD1
;;ADDUCIN, ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adducin is a 200-kD heterodimeric protein associated with the
erythrocyte membrane skeleton, which binds to Ca(2+)/calmodulin (see
114180), promotes binding of spectrin to actin, and is a substrate for
protein kinases C and A (Gardner and Bennett, 1986; Bennett et al.,
1988). The name adducin comes from the Latin 'adducere,' meaning 'to
bring together.'

CLONING

Adducin was first purified from human erythrocytes by Gardner and
Bennett (1986) and subsequently isolated from bovine brain membranes
(Bennett et al., 1988).

Joshi and Bennett (1990) investigated the structure and function of the
separate domains of alpha adducin. Joshi et al. (1991) isolated
reticulocyte cDNAs for alpha- and beta- (ADD2; 102681) adducin. The
deduced alpha-adducin protein contains 737 amino acids and shares
approximately 49% sequence identity with beta adducin, suggesting
evolution by gene duplication. Each adducin subunit has 3 distinct
domains: a 39-kD N-terminal globular protease-resistant domain,
connected by a 9-kD domain to a 33-kD C-terminal protease-sensitive tail
comprised almost entirely by hydrophilic amino acids. The head domains
of both alpha- and beta-adducin have limited sequence similarity with
the N-terminal actin-binding motif present in members of the spectrin
superfamily and actin gelation proteins. The C termini of both proteins
contain an identical 22-amino acid sequence showing similarity to the
MARCKS protein (177061). Northern blot analysis of rat tissues, K562
erythroleukemia cells, and reticulocytes demonstrated ubiquitous
expression of alpha adducin.

Goldberg et al. (1992) identified a 4-kb alpha-adducin transcript that
was abundantly expressed in the caudate nucleus, the site of major
neuronal loss in Huntington disease (HD; 143100). No sequence
alterations specific to HD were discovered in sequencing the brain
alpha-adducin cDNA from 2 HD patients and an age-matched control. Brain
cDNA from both patients and controls showed 2 alternately spliced brain
exons not previously described in erythrocyte cDNA.

In a comprehensive assay of gene expression, Gilligan et al. (1999)
showed the ubiquitous expression of alpha- and gamma-adducin (ADD3;
601568), in contrast to the restricted expression of beta-adducin.
Beta-adducin was expressed at high levels in brain and hematopoietic
tissues (bone marrow in humans, spleen in mice).

See Gilligan and Bennett (1993) for a review of adducin and the other
components of the junctional complex of the cell membrane skeleton.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Joshi et al. (1991) provisionally
assigned the ADD1 gene to chromosome 4 and the ADD2 gene to chromosome
2. Both alpha- and beta-adducin show alternative splicing; thus, there
may be several different heterodimeric or homodimeric forms of adducin,
each with a different functional specificity.

Using the technique of 'exon trapping' devised by Buckler et al. (1991),
Taylor et al. (1992) identified exons corresponding to the alpha subunit
of adducin within the 4p16.3 region where Huntington disease appeared to
be located. They mapped the ADD1 gene immediately telomeric to D4S95.

Goldberg et al. (1992) reported the isolation and cloning of cDNA for
the brain alpha-adducin gene, which they found to be located within 20
kb of D4S95.

Nasir et al. (1994) used an interspecific backcross to map the mouse
Add1 gene to chromosome 5, within the region of syntenic homology with
the short arm of human chromosome 4. Grosson et al. (1994) also mapped
the mouse Add1 gene to chromosome 5 in a continuous linkage group that
included the Huntington disease homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Kuhlman et al. (1996) found that purified human erythrocyte adducin
completely blocked elongation and depolymerization at the fast-growing
barbed ends of actin filaments in vitro, thus functioning as a barbed
end capping protein. This barbed end capping activity required the
intact adducin molecule and was downregulated by calmodulin in the
presence of calcium. Kuhlman et al. (1996) concluded that adducin
restricts actin filament length in erythrocytes.

To investigate the molecular involvement of alpha-adducin in controlling
Na/K pump activity, Torielli et al. (2008) transfected wildtype or
mutated rat and human ADD1 into several renal cell lines and
demonstrated that the rat and human mutated forms increased Na/K pump
activity and the number of pump units; both variants
coimmunoprecipitated with the Na/K pump. The increased pump activity was
not due to changes in its basolateral location, but to an alteration of
Na/K pump residential time on the plasma membrane. Both the rat and
human mutated variants reduced constitutive Na/K pump endocytosis and
similarly affected transferrin receptor (190010) trafficking and
fluid-phase endocytosis. Alpha-adducin was also detected in clathrin
(see 118955)-coated vesicles and coimmunoprecipitated with clathrin.
Torielli et al. (2008) suggested that adducin, in addition to having
modulatory effects on actin cytoskeleton dynamics, might play a direct
role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and that the constitutive
reduction of Na/K pump endocytic rate induced by mutated adducin
variants might be relevant in sodium-dependent hypertension (see
145500).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a case-control study involving 190 patients with primary hypertension
and 126 controls, Casari et al. (1995) found an association between
essential hypertension (see 145500) and allelic markers near the
alpha-adducin locus.

Cusi et al. (1997) found significant linkage of the alpha-adducin locus
to essential hypertension and greater sensitivity to changes in sodium
balance among patients with a particular ADD1 allele, trp460
(102680.0001), suggesting that alpha adducin is associated with a
salt-sensitive form of essential hypertension.

Manunta et al. (1998) analyzed the pressure-natriuresis relationship in
108 hypertensive individuals and found that patients with a G/W or W/W
ADD1 genotype showed lower plasma renin activity and fractional
excretion of sodium as well as reduced slope of the pressure-natriuresis
relationship after sodium depletion or sodium loading compared to G/G
patients. These findings supported the hypothesis that individuals with
at least 1 ADD1 460W allele have increased renal tubular sodium
reabsorption.

Using endogenous lithium and uric acid as markers of proximal tubular
sodium reabsorption, Manunta et al. (1999) investigated the relationship
between renal sodium handling and ADD1 polymorphism in untreated
hypertensive patients and found that adducin genotype was significantly
and directly related to the fractional excretion of lithium. Manunta et
al. (1999) concluded that ADD1 represents a 'renal hypertensive gene'
that modulates the capacity of tubular epithelial cells to transport
sodium and thus affects blood pressure levels.

Allayee et al. (2001) performed a genomewide scan for blood pressure in
18 Dutch families exhibiting the common lipid disorder familial combined
hyperlipidemia (144250). They found a locus on chromosome 4 that
exhibited a significant lod score of 3.9 for systolic blood pressure. In
addition, this locus appeared to influence plasma free fatty acid levels
(lod = 2.4). After adjustment for age and gender, the lod score for
systolic blood pressure increased to 4.6, whereas the lod score for free
fatty acid levels did not change. Allayee et al. (2001) tested for an
association between 2 intragenic ADD1 polymorphisms and systolic blood
pressure in this sample and found none.

Lanzani et al. (2005) examined the association between polymorphisms in
the ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3 genes (G460W, C1797T, and IVS11+386A-G,
respectively) and ambulatory blood pressure and plasma levels of renin
activity and endogenous ouabain in 512 newly discovered and
never-treated hypertensive patients. Relative to carriers of the
wildtype (G/G) ADD1 gene, carriers of the mutant 460W allele had higher
blood pressure and lower plasma renin activity and endogenous ouabain
levels. Polymorphisms in the ADD2 and ADD3 genes taken alone were not
associated with these variables, but the blood pressure difference
between the 2 ADD1 genotypes was greatest in carriers of the ADD3 G
allele (increased by approximately 8 mm Hg; p = 0.020 to 0.006,
depending on the genetic model applied). The authors suggested that
there were epistatic effects between the ADD1 and ADD3 loci affecting
variation in blood pressure.

ANIMAL MODEL

The Milan hypertensive strain of rats develops a genetic form of renal
hypertension that, when compared to its normotensive control, shows
renal dysfunction similar to that of a subset of human patients with
primary hypertension. Bianchi et al. (1994) showed that 1 point mutation
in each of the 2 genes coding for adducin is associated with blood
pressure level in this strain of rats. The hypertensive and normal rats
differed, respectively, by the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine at
position 316 of the alpha subunit; at the beta-adducin locus, the
hypertensive strain was always homozygous for arginine at position 529,
while the normal strain showed either arginine or glutamine in that
position. The arg/gln heterozygotes showed lower blood pressure than any
of the homozygotes. In vitro phosphorylation studies suggested that both
of these amino acid substitutions occurred within protein kinase
recognition sites. Analysis of an F2 generation demonstrated that Y
(tyrosine) alleles segregated with a significant increment in blood
pressure. This effect was modulated by the presence of the R (arginine)
allele of the beta subunit. Bianchi et al. (1994) stated that, taken
together, these findings strongly supported a role for adducin
polymorphisms in causing variation of blood pressure in the Milan strain
of rats. In the rat, the beta- and alpha-adducin genes were said to be
located on chromosomes 4 and 14, respectively.

Tripodi et al. (1996) studied the effects of the Milan hypertensive rat
316Y and 529R mutations in Add1 and Add2, respectively, on actin
polymerization and bundling in a cell-free system and found that
double-mutated adducin exerted only a slight inhibitory effect with a
much higher final extent of polymerization compared to wildtype. Adducin
heterodimer mutated only in the beta subunit behaved as normal adducin,
whereas adducin heterodimer mutated only in the alpha subunit exhibited
an intermediate phenotype, consistent with the associated levels of
blood pressure previously described by Bianchi et al. (1994). Studies of
the actin cytoskeleton in transfected rat kidney epithelial cell lines
showed that cells overexpressing the mutated alpha-adducin chain
exhibited larger microfilament bundles and larger focal contacts with
patchy aggregates of alpha-v integrin (193210), compared to cells
overexpressing wildtype adducin, in which the microfilament bundles were
organized in a much looser texture and alpha-v integrin was present in a
diffuse punctate pattern with small focal contacts. The surface
expression of the Na-K pump alpha subunit was considerably increased in
cells overexpressing the mutated alpha-adducin chain, and Na-K pump
activity at V(max) was increased with respect to normal transfected
lines and untransfected cells. Tripodi et al. (1996) suggested that
adducin has a role in the constitutive capacity of the renal epithelia
both to transport ions and to expose adhesion molecules.

Efendiev et al. (2004) studied Milan rats carrying the hypertensive
adducin phenotype and observed higher renal tubule Na/K-ATPase activity
and found that their Na/K-ATPase molecules did not undergo endocytosis
in response to dopamine like those of normotensive rats. In the
hypertensive rats, dopamine failed to promote the interaction between
adaptins (see 601026) and the Na/K-ATPase, required for endocytosis,
because of adaptin-mu-2 subunit (602296) hyperphosphorylation.
Expression of the hypertensive rat or human variant of ADD1 into normal
renal epithelial cells recreated the hypertensive phenotype with higher
Na/K-ATPase activity, mu-2-subunit hyperphosphorylation, and impaired
Na/K-ATPase endocytosis. The authors concluded that increased renal
Na/K-ATPase activity and altered sodium reabsorption in certain forms of
hypertension could be attributed to a mutant form of adducin that
impairs the dynamic regulation of renal Na/K-ATPase endocytosis in
response to natriuretic signals.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERTENSION, SALT-SENSITIVE ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ADD1, GLY460TRP

Cusi et al. (1997) found a significant association between a
gly460-to-trp polymorphism (G460W) in the ADD1 gene and salt sensitivity
in patients with essential hypertension (see 145500). Patients with the
W460 allele showed greater sensitivity to changes in sodium balance, and
heterozygous hypertensive patients (G/W) showed a greater fall in mean
arterial pressure in response to 2 months' treatment with
hydrochlorothiazide, than did wildtype homozygous (G/G) hypertensive
patients. In controls in an Italian cohort, the G460 allele had a
frequency of 86.4% and the W460 allele 13.6%.

Manunta et al. (1998) analyzed the pressure-natriuresis relationship in
108 hypertensive individuals, 80 of whom were wildtype homozygous (G/G),
26 G/W heterozygous, and 2 W/W homozygous. At baseline, the G/W and W/W
patients showed lower plasma renin activity and fractional excretion of
sodium; these patients also had reduced slope of the
pressure-natriuresis relationship after sodium depletion or sodium
loading compared to G/G patients. These findings supported the
hypothesis that individuals with at least 1 ADD1 460W allele have
increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.

Using endogenous lithium and uric acid as markers of proximal tubular
sodium reabsorption, Manunta et al. (1999) investigated the relationship
between renal sodium handling and ADD1 polymorphism in 54 untreated
hypertensive patients, 29 with the G/G genotype and 25 with the G/W
genotype. Fractional excretions of lithium and uric acid were
significantly decreased in G/W patients compared to G/G patients;
multiple regression analysis showed that adducin genotype was
significantly and directly related to the fractional excretion of
lithium. Manunta et al. (1999) concluded that ADD1 represents a 'renal
hypertensive gene' that modulates the capacity of tubular epithelial
cells to transport sodium and thus affects blood pressure levels.

300061	TITLE *300061 ZINC FINGER, MYM-TYPE 3; ZMYM3
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 261; ZNF261;;
DXS6673E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported the cloning and characterization
of the ZNF261 gene, which the called DXS6673E. ZNF261 maps to the X
chromosome, is subject to X inactivation, and was disrupted in the
5-prime untranslated region by a balanced X;13 translocation in a
mentally retarded female. They identified a YAC clone that spanned the
breakpoint and used this YAC to isolate a cDNA from a fetal brain
library. The cDNA contains a 4,074-bp ORF encoding a predicted
1,358-amino acid polypeptide. By Northern analysis, van der Maarel et
al. (1996) showed that the DXS6673E gene is highly conserved among
vertebrates and that its expression is most abundant in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Hakimi et al. (2003) identified a family of multiprotein corepressor
complexes that function through modifying chromatin structure to keep
genes silent. The polypeptide composition of these complexes includes a
common core of 2 subunits, HDAC1 (601241)/HDAC2 (605164) and the
FAD-binding protein BHC110 (AOF2; 609132). Other subunits of these
complexes include ZNF261, GTF2I (601679), and polypeptides associated
with cancer-causing chromosomal translocations.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported that the ZNF261 gene contains 25
exons, including 2 putative alternatively spliced noncoding exons (1A
and 1B).

MAPPING

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF261 gene to chromosome
Xq13.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported a mentally retarded female whose
ZNF261 gene was disrupted in the 5-prime UTR by a balanced X;13
translocation. They noted that apart from mental retardation, the only
conspicuous clinical features in this patient were scoliosis and spotty
abdominal hypopigmentation.

600940	TITLE *600940 LIGASE III, DNA, ATP-DEPENDENT; LIG3
;;DNA LIGASE III
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chen et al. (1995) purified DNA ligase II and DNA ligase III to near
homogeneity from bovine liver and testis, respectively. Amino acid
sequencing studies indicated that these enzymes are encoded by the same
gene. Chen et al. (1995) isolated human and murine cDNA clones encoding
DNA ligase III (LIG3) with probes based on the peptide sequences. The
LIG3 cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 862 amino acids, whose sequence is
more closely related to those of the DNA ligases encoded by poxviruses
than to replicative DNA ligases, such as human DNA ligase I (126391).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (1995) observed elevated levels of DNA ligase III mRNA in
primary spermatocytes undergoing recombination prior to the first
meiotic division. Therefore, they suggested that DNA ligase III seals
DNA strand breaks that arise during the process of meiotic recombination
in germ cells and as a consequence of DNA damage in somatic cells.

Using primary human fibroblasts, Moser et al. (2007) showed that XRCC1
(194360) and LIG3 were essential core components of nucleotide excision
repair (NER). Downregulation of LIG3 impaired removal of ultraviolet
(UV)-induced lesions and rejoining of UV-induced nicks in chromosomal
DNA. Moreover, XRCC1-LIG3 and polymerase-delta (see POLD1; 174761)
interacted and colocalized with NER components in a UV-specific manner
throughout interphase. In contrast, recruitment of LIG1 (126391) and
polymerase-epsilon (POLE; 174762) to UV-irradiated sites was only
observed in proliferating cells. Moser et al. (2007) concluded that DNA
ligases and polymerases are differentially recruited for NER-mediated
DNA repair during the cell cycle.

Gao et al. (2011) reported that DNA ligase III is essential for
mitochondrial DNA integrity but dispensable for nuclear DNA repair.
Inactivation of ligase III in the mouse nervous system resulted in mtDNA
loss leading to profound mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of
cellular homeostasis, and incapacitating ataxia. Similarly, inactivation
of ligase III in cardiac muscle resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction
and defective heart-pump function leading to heart failure. However,
ligase III inactivation did not result in nuclear DNA repair deficiency,
indicating that essential DNA repair repair functions of Xrcc1 (194360)
can occur in the absence of ligase III. Instead, Gao et al. (2011) found
that ligase I was critical for DNA repair, but acted in a cooperative
manner with ligase III. Additionally, ligase III deficiency did not
recapitulate the hallmark features of neural Xrcc1 inactivation such as
DNA damage-induced cerebellar interneuron loss, further underscoring
functional separation of these DNA repair factors. Therefore, Gao et al.
(2011) concluded that the biological role of ligase III is to maintain
mtDNA integrity and not Xrcc1-dependent DNA repair.

Simsek et al. (2011) demonstrated a crucial role for DNA ligase III in
mitochondria but not in XRCC1-dependent repair. Simsek et al. (2011)
used preemptive complementation to determine the viability requirement
for Lig3 in mammalian cells and its requirement in DNA repair. Various
forms of Lig3 were introduced stably into mouse embryonic stem cells
containing a conditional allele of Lig3 that could be deleted with Cre
recombinase. With this approach, Gao et al. (2011) found that the
mitochondrial, but not nuclear, Lig3 is required for cellular viability.
Although the catalytic function of Lig3 is required, the zinc finger and
BRAC1 C-terminal-related domains of Lig3 are not. Remarkably, the
viability requirement for Lig3 can be circumvented by targeting Lig1 to
the mitochondria or expressing Chlorella virus DNA ligase, the minimal
eukaryal nick-sealing enzyme, or Escherichia coli LigA, an
NAD(+)-dependent ligase. Lig3-null cells are not sensitive to several
DNA-damaging agents that sensitize Xrcc1-deficient cells. Simsek et al.
(2011) concluded that their results established a role for Lig3 in
mitochondria, but distinguished it from its interacting protein XRCC1.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (1995) mapped the LIG3 gene to human chromosome 17 by PCR
analysis of a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel. Wei et al.
(1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the human DNA
ligase III gene to human chromosome 17q11.2-q12.

610900	TITLE *610900 CHMP FAMILY, MEMBER 5; CHMP5
;;CHROMATIN-MODIFYING PROTEIN 5;;
CHARGED MULTIVESICULAR BODY PROTEIN 5;;
HSPC177
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CHMP5 belongs to the chromatin-modifying protein/charged multivesicular
body protein (CHMP) family. These proteins are components of ESCRT-III
(endosomal sorting complex required for transport III), a complex
involved in degradation of surface receptor proteins and formation of
endocytic multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Some CHMPs have both nuclear and
cytoplasmic/vesicular distributions, and one such CHMP, CHMP1A (164010),
is required for both MVB formation and regulation of cell cycle
progression (Tsang et al., 2006).

CLONING

Ward et al. (2005) stated that CHMP5 is a small coiled-coil protein.
Cell fractionation of COS-7 cells followed by Western blot analysis
showed that endogenous Chmp5 was primarily a cytosolic protein.
Fluorescence-tagged human CHMP5 localized to vesicles near the nucleus
in transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using affinity purification experiments, Ward et al. (2005) showed that
LIP5 (610902) specifically interacted with CHMP5. Depletion of CHMP5 by
small-interfering RNA did not alter the distribution of early or late
endocytic markers in HeLa and 293T cells, but it altered EGFR (131550)
trafficking and reduced EGFR degradation in lysosomes. Depletion of
CHMP5 in 293T cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1
increased release of infectious particles.

Tsang et al. (2006) performed a systematic yeast 2-hybrid analysis of
human ESCRT-III components, including CHMP5. CHMP5 interacted with
SMARCA4 (603254), which may be involved in chromatin remodeling. In
addition, CHMP5 interacted with the SUMO (see SUMO1; 601912)-conjugating
enzyme UBE2I (601661) and appeared to be part of a network connecting
CHMP1A, CHMP4B (610897), and CHMP5 with UBE2I, SUMO1, PIAS2 (603567),
and HIPK2 (606868), all of which are involved in nuclear sumoylation
processes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the CHMP5 gene to chromosome 9p13.3 based on an
alignment of the CHMP5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132968) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

611258	TITLE *611258 TUDOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; TDRD7
;;KIAA1529;;
PCTAIRE2-BINDING PROTEIN;;
TUDOR REPEAT ASSOCIATOR WITH PCTAIRE2; TRAP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TDRD7 is a component of cytoplasmic RNA granules with a highly enriched
and conserved pattern of developmental expression in the vertebrate
ocular lens. It is required for posttranscriptional control of mRNAs
that are critical to normal lens development and to RNA granule function
(summary by Lachke et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TDRD7, which they designated
KIAA1529. The cDNA contains MIR repetitive elements in its 5-prime and
3-prime UTRs. The deduced protein contains 1,680 amino acids. RT-PCR
ELISA detected highest expression in human adult and fetal brain, with
moderate expression in ovary, testis, spleen, lung, and kidney, low
expression in pancreas and heart, and no expression in liver and
skeletal muscle. All specific brain regions examined showed moderate
expression.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis to screen a human adult kidney cDNA
library with the N-terminal domain of PCTAIRE2 (PCTK2; 603440) as bait,
Hirose et al. (2000) cloned a partial TDRD7 cDNA, which they called
TRAP. They also cloned full-length rat Tdrd7, which encodes a
1,113-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 125 kD. The
C-terminal half of Tdrd7 contains 5 tudor domains. Endogenous Tdrd7 and
PCTAIRE2 localized to the mitochondria in COS-7 cells, and Western blot
analysis of rat tissues detected Tdrd7 in brain and testis only. Tdrd7
protein levels in the developing rat brain increased gradually from
embryonic day 16 through postnatal day 35 and were correlated with
PCTAIRE2 protein levels. Immunohistochemical studies colocalized rat
Tdrd7 and PCTAIRE2 protein to the cerebral cortex pyramidal cells and to
cerebellar Purkinje cells.

Yamochi et al. (2001) cloned mouse Tdrd7, which encodes a deduced
1,086-amino acid protein with 95% amino acid similarity to rat Tdrd7.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Hirose et al.
(2000) showed that rat Tdrd7 tudor domains 4 and 5 interacted with the
N-terminal domain of PCTAIRE2. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that
Tdrd7 bound PCTAIRE1 (PCTK1; 311550) but did not interact with PCTAIRE3
(PCTK3; 169190).

Using yeast 2-hybrid, GST pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays,
Yamochi et al. (2001) showed that mouse Tdrd7 interacted with Ik3-1
(CABLES; 609194) via the Tdrd7 tudor domains 4 and 5 and the N-terminal
98 amino acids of Ik3-1. Both Tdrd7 and Ik3-1 coimmunoprecipitated with
PCTAIRE2; however, yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Ik3-1 as bait and
PCTAIRE2 as prey showed no interaction. Yamochi et al. (2001) stated
that it is not clear whether Ik3-1 and PCTAIRE2 interact directly with
each other or indirectly via interaction with Tdrd7.

In mouse, Lachke et al. (2011) showed that Tdrd7 is expressed in lens
fiber cells in distinct Tdrd7 RNA granules that interact with Stau1
(601716) ribonucleoproteins. Tdrd7 coimmunoprecipitates with specific
lens mRNAs and is required for the posttranscriptional control of mRNAs
that are critical to normal lens development and RNA granule function.
The RNA granule function of TDRD7 may also be deployed in other tissues
and cell types at various developmental stages; for example, TDRD7 is a
component of a testis-specific RNA granule, the chromatoid body, and
Lachke et al. (2011) observed that Tdrd7-null mice exhibit male
sterility due to an arrest in spermatogenesis at the round spermatid
stage, likely due to a chromatoid body defect. Lachke et al. (2011)
found that Tdrd7 deficiency results in the reduction of Sparc (182120)
transcripts, and Sparc-null mice develop late-onset cataracts that
resemble Tdrd7-null cataracts. These results place TDRD7 function
upstream of SPARC mRNA expression. In addition, SPARC and EPHA2 (176946)
mRNAs have been described as direct targets of STAU1 RNPs, and EPHA2
mutations cause cataracts in both mouse and human.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TDRD7 gene
to chromosome 9.

By analysis of the inversion breakpoint in a patient with cataract and
hypospadias carrying a balanced paracentric inversion of chromosome 9,
46,XY,inv(9)(q22.33q34.11), Lachke et al. (2011) mapped the TDRD7 gene
to chromosome 9q22.33.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with autosomal recessive congenital cataract (CTRCT36;
613887), Lachke et al. (2011) identified a novel in-frame 3-bp deletion
in the TDRD7 gene that removed a highly conserved amino acid, V618
(611258.0001). The mutation was not detected in 320 ethnically matched
controls and was predicted to disrupt the structure of TDRD7 and
therefore likely to represent a loss-of-function mutation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lachke et al. (2011) showed highly specific expression of TDRD7
transcripts in the developing mouse lens as well as the chick lens.
RNAi-mediated gene knockdown of TDRD7 in the developing chick lens led
to cataract formation by embryonic day 16. Mice with ENU-induced
recessive mutation in Tdrd7, identified during a screen for glaucoma
phenotypes, developed cataracts and high intraocular pressure. The mice
were homozygous for a nonsense mutation, Q723X. Within 4 weeks of birth,
all Tdrd7-null mice developed a posterior cataract that became severe
with age. At later stages, the lens fiber cell compartment developed
vacuoles with lens capsule rupture and extrusion of fiber cell mass into
the vitreous. This feature of the mouse lens phenotype precisely
recapitulated the unusual posterior lenticonus and posterior capsule
defects observed in a patient with TDRD7 disruption used to map the
CATC4 phenotype. In some of the Tdrd7-null mice, the mass of fiber cells
passed through the pupil into the anterior chamber. By 4 months of age,
iris flattening was detected and anterior chamber depth increased. By 6
months of age, the intraocular pressure was elevated in some of the
mutants, and the incidence of elevated intraocular pressure increased
with age. Tdrd7-null mice also had an arrest of spermatogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CATARACT 36
TDRD7, 3-BP DEL, VAL618

In a consanguineous family with 4 of 6 children affected with congenital
cataract (CTRCT36; 613887), Lachke et al. (2011) identified a 3-bp
in-frame deletion in the TDRD7 gene, resulting in the removal of valine
at codon 618 (V618), which is highly conserved. This deletion was not
detected in 320 ethnically matched controls or 640 chromosomes and was
predicted to disrupt the structure of TDRD7. Patients were homozygous
for this mutation.

601747	TITLE *601747 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 23; TRIM23
;;ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR DOMAIN PROTEIN 1; ARFD1; ARD1;;
ARF DOMAIN PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM23 belongs to the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of GTPases
and contains an N-terminal GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and a
C-terminal ARF domain (Vitale et al., 2000).

CLONING

Mishima et al. (1993) isolated a gene referred to as ARD1 from human and
rat cDNA libraries. ARD1 encodes a putative 64-kD protein that contains
an 18-kD ADP-ribosylation factor domain at the carboxyl terminus and is
much larger than the other monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding ARF
proteins previously identified.

GENE FUNCTION

Vitale et al. (2000) found that cytohesin-1 (PSCD1; 182115) interacted
with ARD1 in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library.
ARD1-GDP interacted well with cytohesin-1 but poorly with cytohesin-2
(PSCD2; 602488), and cytohesin-1 accelerated binding of a
nonhydrolyzable GTP analog to ARD1. Mutation analysis showed that the
effector region of the ARF domain of ARD1 interacted with the Sec7
domain of cytohesin-1. Physical association between these domains was
highly dependent on experimental conditions, and a free Mg(2+)
concentration that favored nucleotide release from ARD1 and accumulation
of the nucleotide-free ARD1 form also favored interaction between ARD1
and cytohesin-1. In transfected COS-7 cells, ARD1 associated with
vesicular structures concentrated around the nucleus and scattered
throughout the cytoplasm, corresponding to Golgi and lysosomes,
respectively. A constitutively GDP-bound form of ARD1 showed a similar
distribution, whereas a constitutively GTP-bound form of ARD1 was
concentrated close to the nucleus in a Golgi-like distribution only.
Cytohesin-1 was distributed throughout the cell and was also present in
the nucleus. When ARD1 or its GDP- and GTP-bound forms were coexpressed
with cytohesin-1, only the GDP-bound form showed any change in
distribution or colocalization with cytohesin-1. In 90% of cells
coexpressing the proteins, the GDP-bound form of ARD1 was distributed
throughout the cell, except for the nucleus, and largely colocalized
with cytohesin-1. In less than 10% of cells coexpressing the proteins,
the GDP-bound form of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 colocalized in lysosomes.

;;COLONIC AND HEPATIC TUMOR OVEREXPRESSED GENE; CHTOG;;
MINI SPINDLES, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; MSPS;;
KIAA0097
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) cloned CKAP5, which they
designated KIAA0097. The deduced protein contains 2,032 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in skeletal muscle
and lower expression in all other tissues and cell lines examined,
except peripheral blood leukocytes.

Using TACC1 (605301) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mammary
epithelial cDNA library, Lauffart et al. (2002) cloned CKAP5, which they
called CHTOG. CHTOG contains a microtubule-binding domain in its
N-terminal half and a KXGS motif for binding tubulin (see 191110) dimers
in its C-terminal half.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference in HeLa cells, Gergely et al. (2003) found that
TACC3 (605303) depletion did not alter spindle organization, but partly
destabilized microtubules and redistributed CHTOG away from spindle
microtubules. In CHTOG-depleted cells, relatively robust spindles
formed, but they were highly disorganized. Gergely et al. (2003)
concluded that CHTOG plays a major role in organizing spindle poles,
whereas its role in stabilizing spindle microtubules is minor and, at
least in part, mediated via interaction with TACC3.

Brouhard et al. (2008) showed that the Xenopus CKAP5 ortholog, Xmap215,
functioned as a processive microtubule polymerase. Recombinant Xmap215
bound free porcine brain tubulin in a 1:1 complex that interacted with
the microtubule lattice and targeted the ends by a diffusion-facilitated
mechanism. Xmap215 persisted at the plus end and catalyzed the addition
of up to 25 tubulin dimers. Under some circumstances, Xmap215 catalyzed
the reverse reaction, microtubule shrinkage.

MAPPING

Using human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the
CKAP5 gene to chromosome 11.

606738	TITLE *606738 OXYSTEROL-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 10; OSBPL10
;;OSBP-RELATED PROTEIN 10; ORP10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OSBPL10 is a member of the OSBP family of intracellular lipid receptors.
For background information on OSBPs, see OSBP2 (606729).

CLONING

Lehto et al. (2001) used database searching and RT-PCR analysis to
identify a full-length cDNA encoding OSBPL10, which they called ORP10.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 764-amino acid protein contains a
C-terminal sterol-binding (SB) domain of approximately 400 residues that
includes the OSBP motif (EQVSHHPP). It has a pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain in its N terminus. OSBPL10 is 75% and 58% identical to OSBPL11
(606739) in the SB and PH domains, respectively. Dot blot analysis
revealed wide expression that was strongest in kidney and placenta,
followed by heart, skeletal muscle, liver, small intestine, spleen,
lung, and testis.

Jaworski et al. (2001) cloned multiple OSBPs, including OSBPL10. RT-PCR
analysis detected weak expression limited to brain, retinal pigment
epithelium choroid, and cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) determined that the OSBPL10
gene contains at least 8 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) mapped the OSBPL10 gene to
chromosome 3. Jaworski et al. (2001) refined the localization to 3p22 or
3p25.3-p24.1.

612679	TITLE *612679 CUGBP- AND ELAV-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 4; CELF4
;;CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 4;;
BRUNO-LIKE 4; BRUNOL4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF4, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1
(TNRC4; 612678), followed by genomic sequence analysis, Good et al.
(2000) identified BRUNOL4. The deduced protein contains 2 N-terminal
RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), a long linker region, and a C-terminal
RRM. Good et al. (2000) also identified BRUNOL4 splice variants that
encode proteins lacking 20 or 48 amino acids of the third RRM.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to CUGBP (601074),
followed by PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2001) cloned
BRUNOL4, which they called CELF4. In addition to the 3 RRMs, the deduced
486-amino acid CELF4 protein contains multiple potential phosphorylation
sites and a consensus nuclear localization signal near the C terminus.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse tissues detected multiple CELF4
isoforms that were expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle and brain.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) found that CELF4 was
expressed in all adult and fetal human tissues examined, with highest
expression throughout brain and in glandular tissues. Expression was
moderate in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, and low in all other
tissues examined.

Using Northern blot analysis, Yang et al. (2007) found high Brunol4
expression in adult mouse brain. In situ hybridization revealed
strongest Brunol4 expression in hippocampus, with lower expression in
cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and granule cell layer of cerebellum.
Within hippocampus, highest expression was detected in pyramidal neurons
of the CA2 and CA3 region.

Wagnon et al. (2012) found that Celf4 was enriched in the polysome
fraction, but not synaptosome fractions, of cortical mouse brain
lysates. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Celf4 in cell bodies and
proximal processes, but not synapses, in several mouse brain regions.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the BRUNOL4 gene
to chromosome 18q12.

Yang et al. (2007) mapped the Celf4 gene to mouse chromosome 8.

GENE FUNCTION

Ladd et al. (2001) showed that all human CELF proteins, including CELF4,
bound RNA containing muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) elements
and could activate MSE-dependent exon inclusion of cardiac troponin T
(TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in transfected quail fibroblasts.

By analyzing mRNAs with which Celf4 crosslinked, Wagnon et al. (2012)
determined that Celf4 interacted with at least 15% of the transcriptome
in wildtype mouse brain. Celf4 showed specificity for the 3-prime UTRs
of target transcripts and predominantly bound an (A/U)UGU motif.
Comparison of transcripts bound by wildtype and Celf4-deficient mouse
brain revealed that Celf4 controlled a wide variety of transcripts, with
prominent effects on membrane-associated synaptic proteins and
regulators of synaptic plasticity, including transporters and ion
channels, and cell adhesion molecules. Celf4 did not alter splicing
patterns, but appeared to regulate mRNA expression, translation, and
localization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2007) described a mouse mutation in transgenic mice, called
frequent flyer (Ff), that showed genotype-, age-, and strain- dependent
severity of neurologic features beginning at 3 months of age. Defects
included recurrent limbic and tonic-clonic seizures upon routine
handling, spike-wave discharges, and rearing and falling followed by a
running and bouncing phase for which the mutation was named. On a
C57BL/6L background, homozygous (Ff/Ff) mutant mice died perinatally.
Ff/+ heterozygotes also showed hyperactivity and developed late-onset
obesity, but they had a normal life span. Neither Ff/Ff nor Ff/+ mutants
showed abnormal brain morphology. Yang et al. (2007) identified the Ff
mutation as an insertion of the transgene into intron 1 of the Brunol4
gene, where it was predicted to interfere with Brunol4 splicing. RT-PCR
detected no Brunol4 transcripts in Ff/Ff brain and a 45% reduction of
Brunol4 in Ff/+ brain. Microarray analysis of Ff/Ff newborns revealed
downregulation of 94 transcripts, including Brunol4 itself and 4 genes
known or predicted to be involved in neuroexcitability: Htr2c (312861),
Syn2 (600755), Nsf (601633), and Snca (163890).

Wagnon et al. (2011) found that knockout of Celf4 in mice resulted in a
genetically complex seizure disorder similar to that see in Ff mice.
Spatial and temporal conditional knockout of Celf4 alleles showed that
deletion of Celf4 within the first postnatal week resulted in
absence-like nonconvulsive seizures, whereas Celf4 deletion in adult
mice resulted in convulsive seizures. Selective deletion of Celf4 from
cerebral cortex and hippocampal excitatory neurons lowered seizure
threshold and promoted spontaneous convulsions. Deletion of Celf4 from
inhibitory neurons appeared to increase seizure threshold.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Celf4 expression predominantly in
excitatory neurons of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and
reticular thalamus. Patch-clamp recordings of cortical layer V pyramidal
neurons revealed that Celf4 deletion increased response frequency and
amplitude, suggesting that Celf4-deficient mice have altered excitatory,
but not inhibitory, neurotransmission.

604146	TITLE *604146 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 7; SYT7
;;PROSTATE CANCER-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7; PCANAP7;;
IPCA7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptotagmins, such as SYT7, are brain-specific calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding proteins that play a role in synaptic exocytosis
and neurotransmitter release. See 600782.

CLONING

While constructing a transcript map of the human chromosomal 11q13
interval associated with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (153700), By
RT-PCR, Li et al. (1995) determined that rat Syt7 is expressed at high
levels in brain and is widely distributed in non-neural tissues,
particularly heart and lung. Cooper et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs
encoding the human homolog of rat synaptotagmin 7. The predicted
403-amino acid human and rat proteins are 98% identical. Northern blot
analysis revealed that synaptotagmin 7 is expressed as 4.4- and 7.5-kb
mRNAs in a variety of human adult and fetal tissues, including those
from different regions of the brain.

Fukuda et al. (2002) identified 1 major and 2 minor isoforms of mouse
Syt7. The 2 minor isoforms contain unique insertions in the spacer
domain between the transmembrane and C2 domains. Similar results were
obtained with respect to human SYT7. Expression of fluorescence-tagged
Syt7 in rat pheochromocytoma cells revealed localization in the
perinuclear region, where it colocalized with a Golgi marker protein,
and localization in the tips of neurites.

By Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy, Caler et al.
(2001) demonstrated expression of a 65-kD SYT7 antigen on membrane
lysosomes, and SYT7 colocalized with LAMP1 (153330) on a number of cell
types.

Using a method called 'Guilt-by-Association' (GBA), which searches for
novel genes whose expression patterns mimic those of known
disease-associated genes, Walker et al. (1999) examined the pairwise
coexpression patterns of 40,000 human genes in 522 cDNA libraries and
identified several novel genes associated with prostate cancer,
including SYT7, which they named IPCA7. IPCA7 expression was
significantly associated with the expressions of the known prostate
cancer-associated genes PSA (KLK3; 176820), PAP (ACPP; 171790), KLK2
(147960), MSMB (157145), and TGM4 (600585).

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro characterization of recombinant rat Syt7, Li et al. (1995)
determined that Syt7 showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipids
and Ca(2+)-independent binding to adaptor protein-2 (see 601026). Both
C2 domains also showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to syntaxins (see
186590).

Sugita et al. (2001) presented evidence that SYT7 functions as a plasma
membrane Ca(2+) sensor in synaptic exocytosis. Alternatively spliced
forms of rodent Syt7 were expressed in a developmentally regulated
pattern in brain and were concentrated in presynaptic active zones of
central synapses. In a rat neuroendocrine cell line, both C2 domains of
Syt7 were potent inhibitors of Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis, but only
when they bound Ca(2+).

Shin et al. (2002) used gain-of-function C2-domain mutants of
synaptotagmin-1 and loss-of-function C2-domain mutants of
synaptotagmin-7 to examine how synaptotagmins function in dense-core
vesicle exocytosis. Their data indicated that phospholipid, but not
SNARE, binding by plasma membrane synaptotagmins is the primary
determinant of calcium-triggered dense-core vesicle exocytosis. Shin et
al. (2002) concluded that their results support a general lipid-based
mechanism of action of synaptotagmins in exocytosis, with the
specificity of various synaptotagmins for different types of fusion
governed by their differential localizations and calcium affinities.

Chronic infection with the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is
prevalent in extensive areas of South and Central America. The parasite
enters cells by a nonphagocytic mechanism. Entry requires mobilization
of host cell lysosomes to the invasion site, as well as the triggering
of a signaling cascade that results in localized elevation of free
calcium. Thus, T. cruzi cell entry has several features resembling
regulated exocytosis. By glass bead loading of cells with antibody to
the C2A calcium-binding and exocytosis-regulating domain of SYT7, Caler
et al. (2001) showed that T. cruzi, but not Toxoplasma gondii or
Salmonella typhimurium, was markedly inhibited from entering the cells.
Likewise, wildtype SYT7 C2A peptides but not those of other SYTs (e.g.,
SYT1; 185605) could block parasite entry. Caler et al. (2001) concluded
that T. cruzi subverts the calcium-regulated lysosomal exocytic
machinery involving the widely expressed SYT7 protein as a strategy for
cell entry.

Roy et al. (2004) found that the lysosomal synaptotagmin SYT7 is
required for a mechanism that promotes phagolysosomal fusion and limits
the intracellular growth of pathogenic bacteria. SYT7 was required for a
form of calcium-dependent phagolysosome fusion that is analogous to
calcium-regulated exocytosis of lysosomes, which can be triggered by
membrane injury. Bacterial type III secretion systems, which
permeabilize membranes and cause calcium influx in mammalian cells,
promote lysosomal exocytosis and inhibit intracellular survival in Syt7
wildtype but not null cells. Thus, the lysosomal repair response can
also protect cells against pathogens that trigger membrane
permeabilization.

Zhao et al. (2008) found that Syt7 was associated with lysosomes in
mouse osteoclasts and with bone matrix protein-containing vesicles in
mouse osteoblasts. Absence of Syt7 inhibited cathepsin K (CTSK; 601105)
secretion and formation of the ruffled border in osteoclasts and bone
matrix protein deposition in osteoblasts. Furthermore, Syt7-deficient
mice were osteopenic due to impaired bone resorption and formation. Zhao
et al. (2008) concluded that SYT7 is involved in bone remodeling and
homeostasis by modulating secretory pathways in osteoclasts and
osteoblasts.

ANIMAL MODEL

Maximov et al. (2008) found that homozygous Syt7-null mice were viable
and fertile. Mutations in Syt7 that inactivated Ca(2+) binding to both
C2 domains destabilized the protein, whereas inactivation of Ca(2+)
binding to only the second C2 domain did not. Inhibitory neurons from
Syt7-null mice were similar to wildtype neurons in synchronous and
asynchronous neurotransmitter release and in presynaptic short-term
plasticity. Maximov et al. (2008) concluded that Ca(2+) binding to SYT7
stabilizes the protein, but it does not regulate synaptic vesicle
exocytosis.

Gustavsson et al. (2008) found that Syt7-null mice had impaired
glucose-induced insulin secretion. Insulin sensitivity and production,
pancreatic islet architecture and ultrastructural organization, and
metabolic and calcium responses were normal in Syt7-null mice.

Loss of Syt1 abolishes fast exocytosis in chromaffin cells, but overall
secretion is reduced by only 20% because slow exocytosis persists. Since
Syt7 has the properties of a slow Ca(2+) sensor, with higher Ca(2+)
affinity and slower binding kinetics than Syt1, Schonn et al. (2008)
examined Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells from
Syt7-knockout mice and from knockin mice containing normal levels of a
mutant Syt7 lacking the second Ca(2+)-binding domain. Both types of
mutant chromaffin cells showed dramatically decreased Ca(2+)-triggered
exocytosis. Moreover, in chromaffin cells lacking both Syt1 and Syt7,
only a very slow release component persisted. Schonn et al. (2008)
concluded that SYT7, together with SYT1, mediates almost all
Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells.

MAPPING

By transcript mapping of the 11q13 gene-rich region, Cooper et al.
(1998) mapped the SYT7 gene to 11q13.

605939	TITLE *605939 PHOSPHOLIPASE C, DELTA-4; PLCD4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) plays an important
role in receptor-mediated signal transduction by generating 2 second
messenger molecules, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and
diacylglycerol, from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PLC
comprises a diverse family of enzymes that differ in structure and
tissue distribution (Berridge, 1993).

CLONING

By PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers, Lee and Rhee (1996)
cloned PLCD4 from a rat brain cDNA library. The encoded polypeptide
contains 772 amino acids and is similar in primary structure to
delta-type PLC isozymes, with overall sequence identities of 45% to
PLC-delta-1 (602142), 72% to PLC-delta-2, and 47% to PLC-delta-3.
Recombinant PLCD4 was purified from extracts of HeLa cells that had been
infected with vaccinia virus containing the corresponding cDNA. The
purified PLCD4 protein exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 90 kD.
Specific activity and its dependence on calcium were similar to those of
PLCD1. The distribution of PLCD4 in 16 different rat tissues was studied
by immunoblot analysis with PLCD4-specific antibodies of fractions
obtained after an enzyme-enrichment procedure. The 90-kD immunoreactive
protein was detected unambiguously in only 8 tissues (testis, brain,
skeletal muscle, thyroid gland, stomach, thymus, aorta, and heart) and
was present at concentrations that were low compared to those of other
major PLC isozymes. An 86-kD band was detectable in spleen. A 93-kD
immunoreactive protein was also prominent in testis but was not detected
in the other 7 positive tissues. The 93-kD enzyme appears to be derived
from a splice variant of the mRNA that encodes the 90-kD PLCD4 and
contains an additional 32 amino acids between the X and Y catalytic
domains.

Kim et al. (1999) stated that human PLCD4 was cloned from an
oligodendroglioma cDNA library (GenBank GENBANK AI366170).

MAPPING

Kim et al. (1999) mapped the human PLCD4 gene to chromosome band 2q35 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fukami et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in PLCD4 by targeted
disruption. Male Plcd4-deficient mice either produced few small litters
or were sterile. In vitro fertilization studies showed that insemination
with Plcd4 -/- sperm resulted in significantly fewer eggs becoming
activated and that the calcium transients associated with fertilization
were absent or delayed. Plcd4 -/- sperm were unable to initiate the
acrosome reaction, an exocytotic event required for fertilization and
induced by interaction with the egg coat, the zona pellucida. Fukami et
al. (2001) concluded that PLCD4 functions in the acrosome reaction
during mammalian fertilization.

601805	TITLE *601805 G PROTEIN-COUPLED ESTROGEN RECEPTOR; GPER
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 30; GPR30;;
CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR-LIKE 2; CMKRL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Owman et al. (1996) performed PCR of template DNA from human B-cell
lymphoblasts using degenerate primers to G protein-coupled receptors.
They identified a full-length cDNA encoding a 375-amino acid protein,
which they termed CMKRL2. CMKRL2 is expressed in the Burkitt lymphoma
cell lines Raji and Daudi but not in T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells, T- or
B-cell leukemias, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or other cancer cell
lines (Owman et al., 1996). Northern blot analysis of normal tissue
showed expression of a 2.4-kb transcript in many tissues including the
brain; there was no detectable mRNA in placenta, bone marrow, or
peripheral blood leukocytes (Owman et al., 1996).

Using the technique of differential cDNA library screening to identify
genes overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ESR)-positive breast carcinoma
cell lines compared to ESR-negative cell lines, Carmeci et al. (1997)
isolated a CMKRL2 cDNA and designated it GPR30. Sequence analysis
determined that the clone shares significant homology to G
protein-coupled receptors. This receptor was abundantly expressed in 3
ESR-positive breast carcinoma cell lines. Expression was absent or
minimal in 3 ESR-negative breast carcinoma cell lines. It was
ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues examined, but was most
abundant in placenta. In 11 primary breast carcinomas, it was detected
in all 4 ESR-positive tumors and in only 1 of 7 ESR-negative tumors. The
pattern of expression of the gene indicated that the receptor may be
involved in physiologic responses specific to hormonally responsive
tissues.

Using PCR with degenerate primers to identify novel members of the G
protein-coupled receptor family, Feng and Gregor (1997) also cloned
GPR30. They designated the gene CEPR for 'constitutively/commonly
expressed peptide-like receptor' because the 3.3-kb mRNA was detected in
most human tissues on Northern blots. They found that CEPR is encoded by
an intronless gene. Similarly, Kvingedal and Smeland (1997) cloned GPR30
using RT-PCR of B-cell mRNA to identify G protein-coupled receptors
expressed in lymphocytes. They designated the gene LyGPR for
'lymphocyte-derived G protein-coupled receptor.' Takada et al. (1997)
cloned GPR30 from endothelial cells exposed to fluid shear stress. They
designated the gene FEG1 for 'flow-induced endothelial G protein-coupled
receptor gene-1.'

GENE FUNCTION

Revankar et al. (2005) found that unlike other known G protein-coupled
receptors, GPR30 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it
specifically binds estrogen and estrogen derivatives. Activating GPR30
by estrogen resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization and synthesis
of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the nucleus. Revankar et
al. (2005) concluded that GPR30 represents an intracellular
transmembrane estrogen receptor that may contribute to normal estrogen
physiology as well as pathophysiology. Pietras et al. (2005) questioned
the conclusions raised by Revankar et al. (2005); Prossnitz et al.
(2005) provided a response.

MAPPING

Owman et al. (1996) mapped the CMKRL2 gene to 7p22 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Based upon PCR analysis in somatic hybrid cell
lines, Carmeci et al. (1997) mapped the GPR30 gene to 7p22.

118661	TITLE *118661 VERSICAN; VCAN
;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN 2; CSPG2;;
CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN, CARTILAGE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were first identified in hyaline
cartilage, where they specifically interact with hyaluronan and form
large supramolecular complexes. Together with other matrix
glycoproteins, they provide mechanical support and a fixed negative
charge. Such molecules exist also in a variety of soft tissues where
they may play additional physiologic roles (Kjellen and Lindahl, 1991).

CLONING

Zimmermann and Ruoslahti (1989) cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the
core protein of fibroblast chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. They
designated it versican in recognition of its versatile modular
structure. Decorin (125255) and biglycan (301870) are 2 other soft
tissue proteoglycans.

Naso et al. (1995) reported that the mouse versican protein is 89%
identical to human versican and is highly expressed in mouse embryos at
days 13, 14, and 18.

Dours-Zimmermann and Zimmermann (1994) provided evidence for the
existence of 3 versican splice variants, designated V0, V1, and V2,
which differ in the length of their glycosaminoglycan attachment portion
inserted between the globular modules at the N- and C-terminal ends of
the core proteins. Versican V1 and V2 include either the GAG-alpha or
the GAG-beta domain providing attachment sites for about 5 to 8 or 12 to
15 glycosaminoglycan chains, respectively. In the V0 variant, both
GAG-alpha and GAG-beta are present. Zako et al. (1995) demonstrated the
existence of another splice variant, designated V3, which lacks a
chondroitin sulfate attachment region, the most distinctive portion of a
proteoglycan molecule.

Bode-Lesniewska et al. (1996) studied the distribution of versican by
using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that recognize the core
protein of the prominent versican splice variants V0 and V1. Versican
was present in the loose connective tissues of various organs and was
often associated with the elastic fiber network. It was localized in
most smooth muscle tissues and in fibrous and elastic cartilage.
Versican staining was noted in the central and peripheral nervous
system, in the basal layer of the epidermis, and on the luminal surface
of some glandular epithelia. In blood vessels, versican was present in
all 3 wall layers of veins and elastic arteries. In muscular arteries
the immunoreactivity was normally restricted to the tunica adventitia.
However, it appeared in the media and the split elastica interna of
atherosclerotically transformed vessel walls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Naso et al. (1994) showed that the human versican gene contains 15 exons
spanning more than 90 kb. One of these, exon 7, is used in an
alternative splice variant. The authors sequenced the 5-prime
promoter-containing region of the gene and found that it contained
numerous binding sites for transactivators such as AP2 (107580) and Sp1
(189906). They used transient transfection studies to show that the
promoter functioned well in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. The
authors used deletion studies to show that this 5-prime region (to
approximately -630) contains both strong enhancer and strong negative
regulatory elements.

MAPPING

The distinctness of CSPG1 (AGC1; 155760) and CSPG2 was uncertain until
both genes had been mapped. Whereas CSPG1 is located on chromosome 15,
Iozzo et al. (1992) demonstrated that the CSPG2 gene is located on
chromosome 5. They used a combination of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids including a panel of hybrids containing partial deletions of
chromosome 5 and narrowed the assignment to 5q12-q14, with the precise
site likely to be 5q13.2, by in situ hybridization.

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Naso et al. (1995) assigned the
Cspg2 gene to mouse chromosome 13 in a region that is syntenic with 5q.

GENE FUNCTION

To determine whether TP53 (191170) gene dosage affects transcriptional
regulation of target genes, Yoon et al. (2002) performed oligonucleotide
array gene expression analysis by using human cells with wildtype p53 or
with 1 or both TP53 alleles disrupted by homologous recombination. They
identified 35 genes, including CSPG2, whose expression was significantly
correlated to the dosage of TP53. Motif search analysis revealed that
CSPG2 contains a p53 consensus binding site in its first intron. In
vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that CSPG2 is directly
transactivated by p53.

To understand how cancer cells infect the inflammatory microenvironment,
Kim et al. (2009) conducted a biochemical screen for
macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. They
demonstrated that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production
of interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha; 119160) through activation of the Toll-like receptor family
members TLR2 (603028) and TLR6 (605403). Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were
found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of
LLC-conditioned medium led to identification of the extracellular matrix
proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumors
including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2
and its coreceptors TLR6 and CD14 (158120). By activating TLR2:TLR6
complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican
strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. Kim et al. (2009) concluded
that their results explained how advanced cancer cells usurp components
of the host innate immune system, including bone marrow-derived myeloid
progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for
metastatic growth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wagner vitreoretinopathy (WGVRP; 143200) is an autosomal dominant
vitreoretinopathy. Miyamoto et al. (2005) demonstrated a heterozygous
A-to-G transversion at the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice
site of intron 7 of the CSPG2 gene that cosegregated with the disease in
a Japanese family (118661.0001).

In the large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally
described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006) identified
a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 8 of the VCAN gene
(118661.0002) that segregated fully with disease.

In affected members of 7 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy,
Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for 3 splice site
mutations in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0003-118661.0005).
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) in all patients with intron 7 nucleotide changes, as well
as in a Chinese family with vitreoretinopathy in which a causal variant
was not identified. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) suggested that Wagner
vitreoretinopathy is caused by an imbalance of versican isoforms,
mediated by intronic variants.

In a 4-generation French family with a severe vitreoretinal disorder
mapping to 5q13-q14, Brezin et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
splice site mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0006) that
segregated with disease and was not found 100 French controls.

In a British family and a French family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy,
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) sequenced the VCAN gene and identified
2 heterozygous splice site mutations, in intron 8 and intron 7 of the
VCAN gene, respectively, that segregated with disease in each family
(118661.0007 and 118661.0008). The levels of splice variants V2 and V3
were significantly increased in all patient fibroblast and blood samples
from these families as well as samples from the Swiss family with
vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner (1938), although the
magnitude of the increase varied between tissues and mutations. There
were no statistically significant differences in V0 and V1 levels in
fibroblasts or blood between patients and controls.

In a Japanese family with Wagner syndrome (143200) in which members of 4
generations, to a total of 13 with 11 living at the time of study, were
affected, Miyamoto et al. (2005) described a heterozygous splice
acceptor site mutation in the CSPG2 gene: 4004-2 A-G. Results of RT-PCR
analysis indicated that the mutation activated a cryptic splice site
located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site.

In a large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy (143200),
originally described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous transition (9265+1G-A) at the highly conserved
splice donor sequence in intron 8 of the VCAN gene, which segregated
with the phenotype in 21 affected and 26 unaffected family members and
was not found in 104 control alleles. RT-PCR analysis using patient RNA
from venous blood revealed 2 aberrant CSPG2 transcripts, 1 lacking the
entire exon 8 and the other missing only the last 21 bp of exon 8.

Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) analyzed fibroblasts from a member of
the Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner
(1938) and found a 700-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican isoforms
V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls. In patient blood samples,
amounts of V2 and V3 were increased 48-fold and 32-fold, respectively.

In all affected individuals from 5 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy
(143200), including 4 families diagnosed with Wagner syndrome and 1 with
erosive vitreoretinopathy, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for a transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-C) of the VCAN
gene. The mutation was not found in unaffected individuals from any of
the 5 families, or in 250 Dutch controls. The 5 families shared a common
haplotype on chromosome 5q14, suggesting a founder mutation.
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) compared to controls.

transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 45-fold
and more than 13-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 137-fold
and more than 22-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, A-T, -2

In 10 affected members of a 4-generation French family with severe
vitreoretinopathy (1432300), Brezin et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a transversion within the highly conserved acceptor
splice site of intron 7 (4004-2A-T) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in 6 unaffected family members or in 100 French controls.
Patients in this kindred had a highly variable phenotype, including
exudative vascular abnormalities, and exhibited severe visual
impairment. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblastoid cell RNA indicated
that the mutation activates a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon
8, located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site. Direct sequencing of a shortened RNA fragment showed loss of the
first 39 bp of exon 8, predicted to cause in-frame deletion of 13 amino
acid residues from the beginning of the GAG-beta domain of mature
versican. RT-PCR also indicated aberrant expression of a versican mRNA
lacking the entire exon 8.

unaffected family members or in 300 control alleles. In patient
fibroblasts, there was an 80-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican
isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls, whereas in
patient blood samples, amounts of V2 and V3 increased 64-fold and
6-fold, respectively.

613288	TITLE *613288 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 72; TRIM72
;;MITSUGUMIN, 53-KD; MG53
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cai et al. (2009) cloned mouse Trim72, which they called Mg53, from a
skeletal muscle cDNA library. By database analysis, they identified
human MG53. Both the mouse and human proteins contain 477 amino acids
and have an N-terminal tripartite motif consisting of RING, B-box, and
coiled-coil domains, followed by a C-terminal SPRY domain. Northern and
Western blot analyses of mouse tissues detected Mg53 RNA and protein
only in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Fluorescence-tagged Mg53 and
endogenous Mg53 localized to the sarcolemmal membrane and intracellular
vesicles of mouse skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Cai et al. (2009) showed that overexpression of Mg53 increased vesicular
trafficking and plasma membrane fusion events in C2C12 mouse myogenic
cells. Scrape-wounding of C2C12 cells resulted in dense accumulation of
fluorescence-tagged Mg53 at the site of membrane damage, and this
accumulation required Mg53 oligomerization and was associated with
nucleation of vesicles into a membrane patch. Oligomerization of Mg53
required oxidation of cys242, and interaction of Mg53 with
phosphatidylserine mediated recruitment of vesicles to sites of injury.
Translocation of fluorescence-tagged Mg53 to sites of injury showed both
Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent components.

Zhu et al. (2011) showed that mouse Mg53 and Ptrf (603198) interacted
with each other and functioned together in muscle membrane repair. Ptrf
was required for the translocation of Mg53 to the site of membrane
injury in cell culture models and in mice irradiated with a UV laser to
cause localized sarcolemma damage. A mouse mutant ortholog of the PTRF
525delG mutation (603198.0002) resulted in mislocalization of Ptrf to
the nucleus in transfected human cell lines. Consequently, mutant Ptrf
was unable to target Mg53 to the plasma membrane for repair of
detergent-induced membrane damage. The authors also showed that
cholesterol, which is exposed during membrane damage, was critical for
membrane repair. Cholesterol, bound by Ptrf, functioned as a nucleation
site for the recruitment of Mg53-containing vesicles. Zhu et al. (2011)
hypothesized that, upon cell membrane disruption, PTRF recognizes
exposed cholesterol at the site of injury and tethers MG53 and its
associated intracellular vesicles to the damage site, allowing formation
of a membrane repair patch.

Song et al. (2013) showed in mice that muscle-specific Mg53 mediates the
degradation of the insulin receptor (147670) and insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545), and when upregulated causes metabolic
syndrome featuring insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, and
dyslipidemia. Mg53 expression is markedly elevated in models of insulin
resistance, and Mg53 overexpression suffices to trigger muscle insulin
resistance and metabolic syndrome sequentially. Conversely, ablation of
Mg53 prevents diet-induced metabolic syndrome by preserving the insulin
receptor, Irs1, and insulin signaling integrity. Mechanistically, Mg53
acts as an E3 ligase targeting the insulin receptor and Irs1 for
ubiquitin-dependent degradation, comprising a central mechanism
controlling insulin signal strength in skeletal muscle. Song et al.
(2013) concluded that these findings defined MG53 as a novel therapeutic
target for treating metabolic disorders and associated cardiovascular
complications.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cai et al. (2009) determined that the TRIM72 gene contains 6 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Cai et al., 2009 determined that the TRIM72 gene
maps to chromosome 16p11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cai et al. (2009) found that Mg53 -/- mice were viable until at least 11
months of age. However, Mg53 -/- mice developed progressive skeletal
muscle pathology, with increased number of central nuclei in myotubes,
decreased diameter of muscle fibers, and compromised contractile
function. Skeletal muscle pathology was exacerbated by exercise stress
in Mg53 -/- muscle and involved susceptibility to skeletal muscle
membrane injury. Primary cultures of wildtype muscle could reseal
sarcolemmal membranes following puncture wounding, but Mg53 -/- muscle
could not, resulting in Ca(2+)-induced contraction. Electron microscopy
revealed limited recruitment of vesicles to damaged sarcolemma in Mg53
-/- mice. The defect in membrane repair in Mg53 -/- muscle appeared to
be upstream of a Ca(2+)-dependent membrane-resealing process.

;;THYMOSIN, BETA-4; TMSB4;;
TB4X;;
PROTHYMOSIN BETA-4; PTMB4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Thymosin-beta-4 induces the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase activity in vivo and in vitro, inhibits the migration of
macrophages, and stimulates the secretion of hypothalamic luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone (Clauss et al., 1991).

CLONING

By differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from leukocytes of
an acute lymphocytic leukemia patient, Gondo et al. (1987) isolated a
cDNA encoding thymosin-beta-4. Using Northern blot analysis, they
studied the expression of the 830-nucleotide thymosin-beta-4 mRNA in
various primary myeloid and lymphoid malignant cell lines and in
hemopoietic cell lines. Gondo et al. (1987) stated that the pattern of
thymosin-beta-4 gene expression suggests that it may be involved in an
early phase of the host defense mechanism.

Clauss et al. (1991) noted that the protein was originally isolated from
a partially purified extract of calf thymus, thymosin fraction 5, which
induced differentiation of T cells and was partially effective in some
immunocompromised animals. Further studies demonstrated that the
molecule is ubiquitous; it had been found in all tissues and cell lines
analyzed. It is found in highest concentrations in spleen, thymus, lung,
and peritoneal macrophages. Clauss et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA clone
for the human interferon-inducible gene 6-26 (Friedman et al., 1984) and
showed that its sequence was identical to that for the human
thymosin-beta-4 gene.

Clauss et al. (1991) stated that rat thymosin-beta-4 is synthesized as a
44-amino acid propeptide which is processed into a 43-amino acid peptide
by removal of the first methionyl residue. The molecule does not have a
signal peptide. Human thymosin-beta-4 has a high degree of homology to
rat thymosin-beta-4; the coding regions differ by only 9 nucleotides,
and these are all silent base changes.

Li et al. (1996) established that in the mouse there is a single Tmsb4
gene and that the lymphoid-specific transcript is generated by extending
the ubiquitous exon 1 with an alternate downstream splice site.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1996) stated that thymosin-beta-4 is an actin monomer
sequestering protein that may have a critical role in modulating the
dynamics of actin polymerization and depolymerization in nonmuscle
cells. Its regulatory role is consistent with the many examples of
transcriptional regulation of T-beta-4 and of tissue-specific
expression. Lymphocytes have a unique T-beta-4 transcript relative to
the ubiquitous transcript found in many other tissues and cells.

Lahn and Page (1997) determined that the TB4X gene escapes X
inactivation, and suggested that it should be investigated as a
candidate gene for Turner syndrome. See 400010.

Commenting on the use of high-density DNA microarrays in gene expression
profiling, Ridley (2000) pointed out that the results of Clark et al.
(2000) indicated that thymosin beta-4 is required for the metastasis of
melanoma cells.

Bock-Marquette et al. (2004) demonstrated that the G-actin sequestering
peptide thymosin beta-4 promoted myocardial and endothelial cell
migration in the embryonic heart and retained this property in postnatal
cardiomyocytes. Survival of embryonic and postnatal cardiomyocytes in
culture was also enhanced by thymosin beta-4. Thymosin beta-4 formed a
functional complex with PINCH1 (602567) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK;
602366), resulting in activation of the survival kinase AKT, also known
as protein kinase B (164730). After coronary artery ligation in mice,
thymosin beta-4 treatment resulted in upregulation of Ilk and Akt
activity in the heart, enhanced early myocyte survival, and improved
cardiac function. Bock-Marquette et al. (2004) concluded that thymosin
beta-4 promotes cardiomyocyte migration, survival, and repair.

By subtractive hybridization and real-time RT-PCR, Ji et al. (2003)
found that TMSB4X was one of several genes whose expression was
increased in nonsmall cell lung cancers prior to metastasizing. TMSB4X
expression was associated with cancers in a stage- and
histology-specific manner. Ji et al. (2003) suggested that TMSB4X
expression may be a prognostic parameter for patient survival in stage I
nonsmall cell lung cancer.

Smart et al. (2007) identified thymosin beta-4 as essential for all
aspects of coronary vessel development in mice, and demonstrated that
T-beta-4 stimulates significant outgrowth from quiescent adult
epicardial explants, restoring pluripotency and triggering
differentiation of fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial
cells. T-beta-4 knockdown in the heart is accompanied by significant
reduction in the proangiogenic cleavage product
N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP). Although injection of
this cleavage product was unable to rescue T-beta-4 mutant hearts, it
significantly enhanced endothelial cell differentiation from adult
epicardially-derived precursor cells. Smart et al. (2007) concluded that
their study identifies T-beta-4 and AcSDKP as potent stimulators of
coronary vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and reveals T-beta-4-induced
adult epicardial cells as a viable source of vascular progenitors for
continued renewal of regressed vessels at low basal level or sustained
neovascularization following cardiac injury.

In mice, Smart et al. (2011) demonstrated that the adult heart contains
a resident stem or progenitor cell population, which has the potential
to contribute bona fide terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes after
myocardial infarction. Smart et al. (2011) revealed a novel genetic
label of the activated adult progenitors via reexpression of a key
embryonic epicardial gene, Wilms tumor-1 (WT1; 607102), through priming
by thymosin beta-4, a peptide shown to restore vascular potential to
adult epicardium-derived progenitor cells with injury. Cumulative
evidence indicated an epicardial origin of the progenitor population,
and embryonic reprogramming resulted in the mobilization of this
population and concomitant differentiation to give rise to de novo
cardiomyocytes. Cell transplantation confirmed a progenitor source and
chromosome painting of labeled donor cells revealed transdifferentiation
to a myocyte fate in the absence of cell fusion. Smart et al. (2011)
showed that derived cardiomyocytes are able to structurally and
functionally integrate with resident muscle; as such, stimulation of
this adult progenitor pool represented a significant step towards
resident cell-based therapy in human ischemic heart disease.

MAPPING

By use of a panel of human rodent somatic cell hybrids, Clauss et al.
(1991) showed that the 6-26 cDNA, corresponding to the human
thymosin-beta-4 gene, recognized 7 genes, members of a multigene family,
present on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 20, and X. These genes are
symbolized TMSL1, TMSL2, etc., respectively.

By interspecific backcross mapping, Li et al. (1996) located the mouse
gene, which they symbolized Ptmb4, to the distal region of the mouse X
chromosome, linked to Btk (300300) and Gja6. Thus, the human gene could
be predicted to reside on the X chromosome in the general region of
Xq21.3-q22, where BTK is located. By analysis of somatic cell hybrids,
Lahn and Page (1997) mapped the thymosin-beta-4, or TB4X, gene to the X
chromosome. They noted that a homologous gene, TB4Y (400017), is present
on the Y chromosome.

300482	TITLE *300482 GRB2-ASSOCIATED BINDING PROTEIN 3; GAB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to GAB1 (604439),
followed by screening dendritic cell and eosinophil cDNA libraries, Wolf
et al. (2002) cloned GAB3. The deduced 586-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and potential SH2- and
SH3-binding motifs. The PH domains of GAB1, GAB2 (606203), and GAB3
share about 50% amino acid identity, while the remainder of the proteins
share about 14% identity. Wolf et al. (2002) also cloned mouse Gab3,
which encodes a deduced 595-amino acid protein. RT-PCR detected mouse
Gab3 expressed at high levels in spleen and thymus and at lower levels
in brain, heart, lung, kidney, uterus, and embryonic stem cells, but not
in other tissues examined. Gab3 was expressed in all myeloid and
macrophage cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Wolf et al. (2002) examined the role of Gab3 in macrophage
differentiation and signal transduction using a mouse myeloid progenitor
cell line exogenously expressing Fms (164770), the receptor for
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF; 120420). Gab3 was tyrosine
phosphorylated following receptor stimulation, and it associated
transiently with the SH2 domain-containing proteins Shp2 (176876) and
p85 of the PI3K complex (see 171833). Overexpression of exogenous Gab3
dramatically accelerated macrophage differentiation upon MCSF
stimulation. Examination of phosphorylation mutants suggested that Gab3
is important for macrophage differentiation and that differentiation
requires the early phosphorylation of Gab2, followed by induction and
subsequent phosphorylation of Gab3.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GAB3
gene to chromosome X (TMAP RH80611).

ANIMAL MODEL

Seiffert et al. (2003) found normal hematopoiesis in mice lacking Gab3,
and macrophages developed in normal numbers and exhibited normal
function. Gab3-deficient mice had no major immune deficiency in T- and
B-lymphocyte responses to protein antigens or during viral infection.
Allergic responses also appeared normal.

606687	TITLE *606687 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2B, SUBUNIT 4; EIF2B4
;;EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2B, DELTA;;
EIF2B-DELTA
DESCRIPTION EIF2B is a GTP exchange factor that is essential for protein synthesis.
Its substrate is EIF2 (see 603907). EIF2B consists of alpha (EIF2B1;
606686), beta (EIF2B2; 606454), gamma (EIF2B3; 606273), delta, and
epsilon (EIF2B5; 603945) subunits.

CLONING

By screening human genomic and cDNA libraries, followed by probing mouse
cDNA libraries, Henderson et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding 2 isoforms
of mouse Eif2b4, one containing 544 amino acids and the other containing
524 amino acids. The isoforms differ at their N termini. Henderson et
al. (1994) stated that the shorter isoform is present in rabbit and
human cells. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 1.9-kb
Eif2b4 transcript in mouse. Western blot analysis showed expression of
an approximately 60-kD protein, close to the predicted size. Price et
al. (1996) cloned a cDNA encoding rat Eif2b4. The 525-amino acid rat
protein is 96% identical to the 524-amino acid mouse isoform.

GENE FUNCTION

Fogli et al. (2004) measured the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) activity of EIF2B in transformed lymphocytes from 30 patients with
leukoencephalopathies (603896) with homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5 compared to 10
unaffected heterozygotes and 22 controls with no EIF2B mutation. A
significant decrease of 20 to 70% in GEF activity was observed in all
mutated cells, and the extent of the decrease correlated with age at
onset of disease. Fogli et al. (2004) suggested that a deficiency in GEF
activity underlies the encephalopathy in EIF2B-related disease.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the EIF2B4
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP WI-12589).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM; 603896) is an
autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a chronic progressive
course with additional episodes of rapid deterioration provoked by fever
and minor head trauma. Van der Knaap et al. (2002) demonstrated that
mutations in each of the 5 subunits of translation initiation factor
eIF2B can cause this disorder, including mutations in the EIF2B4 gene.

Fogli et al. (2003) identified mutations in the EIF2B2, EIF2B4, and
EIF2B5 genes in patients with VWM with ovarian failure, which they
referred to as ovarioleukodystrophy (603896).

mutation (Y489H; 606687.0006). They were examined at 23 and 24 years of
age, respectively. Both had had difficulties in school. In both there
was spasticity of gait, gait instability having begun at ages 10 and 15
years, respectively, and 1 required the use of a walker at age 16 years.
Optic atrophy was present in both. Cognitive function was mildly to
moderately reduced.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By 2-dimensional electrophoresis of nuclear matrix proteins from various
types of human cells, Holzmann et al. (1998) detected a common nuclear
matrix protein that they designated NMP238. Using a partial protein
sequence, they searched an EST database and identified a cDNA encoding
NMP238. The calculated molecular mass and pI of the predicted 456-amino
acid protein were close to the experimentally determined values of 54 kD
and 6.5. By immunofluorescence, Holzmann et al. (1998) determined that
NMP238 is found primarily in the nucleus, although it is also present in
the cytoplasm. The NMP238 staining pattern appeared as punctate signals
in both in situ prepared nuclear matrices and in the nucleoplasm of
whole cells. Northern blot and RNA dot blot analysis revealed that
NMP238 is expressed ubiquitously as an approximately 1.8-kb mRNA.

Bacterial RuvB proteins function as DNA helicases that promote branch
migration of Holliday junctions that form during genetic recombination.
Independently, Qiu et al. (1998) isolated NMP238 cDNAs, designating the
protein RUVBL1 (E. coli RuvB-like-1). They reported that RUVBL1 has
homology to bacterial RuvB proteins. The regions of homology contained,
among other motifs, Walker A and B motifs characteristic of DNA/RNA
helicases.

Makino et al. (1998) identified RUVBL1 as the human homolog of rat
TIP49, a 49-kD TATA box-binding protein (TBP; 600075)-interacting
protein. Rat and human TIP49 differ at only 1 amino acid position.

Bauer et al. (1998) demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy that
RUVBL1 is present in small dot-like structures in the nucleus but not in
nucleoli.

GENE FUNCTION

Qiu et al. (1998) found that RUVBL1 coimmunoprecipitated with several
cellular proteins and was present in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme
complex purified over multiple chromatographic steps. Qiu et al. (1998)
identified 2 S. cerevisiae RuvB homologs, scRuvBL1 and scRuvBL2, which
share 70% and 42% protein sequence identity with RUVBL1, respectively.
They determined that scRuvBL1 is essential for viability in yeast.

Wood et al. (2000) used the MYC (190080) transactivation domain to
affinity purify tightly associated nuclear proteins. They identified 2
of these proteins as RUVBL1 and a novel related protein, RUVBL2
(604788). RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are both highly conserved in evolution and
contain ATPase/helicase motifs. The authors showed that RUVBL1 and
RUVBL2 are complexed with MYC in vivo and that binding is dependent on a
MYC domain essential for oncogenic activity. A missense mutation in the
RUVBL1 ATPase motif acted as a dominant inhibitor of MYC oncogenic
activity but did not inhibit normal cell growth, indicating that
functional RUVBL1 protein is an essential mediator of MYC oncogenic
transformation. Wood et al. (2000) concluded that the RUVBL1 and RUVBL2
ATPase/helicase proteins represent a class of cofactors recruited by
transcriptional activation domains that function in diverse pathways.

Using the N-terminal 284 amino acids of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806),
Bauer et al. (1998) identified RUVBL1, which they termed pontin-52, as a
52-kD binding partner of CTNNB1. Using binding analysis, they confirmed
that RUVBL1 serves as a bridge between CTNNB1 (residues 187-284) and TBP
as predicted by sequence analysis. Bauer et al. (1998) also observed
interaction between RUVBL1 and the CTNNB1-lymphoid enhancer-binding
factor-1 (LEF1; 153245) complex.

Hawley et al. (2001) identified TIP49 as a plasminogen (173350)-binding
protein on the surface of a monocytic cell line. Monocytic cells treated
with carboxypeptidase B (CPB1; 114852) lost the ability to bind and
activate plasminogen, and TIP49 was found to be the plasminogen-binding
protein altered by the CPB1 treatment. With use of recombinant rat TIP49
in an in vitro binding assay, Hawley et al. (2001) confirmed binding of
plasminogen to immobilized TIP49. They demonstrated activation of
TIP49-bound plasminogen by cleavage of a plasmin substrate.

The NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex is responsible for
acetylation of the N-terminal tails of histone H4 (see 602822) and H2A
(see 613499) in yeast. Its catalytic subunit, Esa1, is homologous to
human TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409). Using affinity purification, Western blot
analysis, cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and mass
spectrometry, Doyon et al. (2004) found that TIP60 and its splice
variant, TIP60B/PLIP, were part of a multisubunit NuA4 complex with HAT
activity in several human cell lines. They identified RUVBL1 as 1 of 3
subunits specific to the human NuA4 HAT complex.

Using RNA interference in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Fazzio et al.
(2008) found that depletion of any of 7 components of the Tip60-p400
(EP400; 606265) HAT and nucleosome remodeling complex, including Ruvbl1,
caused the same phenotype. Unlike normal ES cells, which grow in
spherical 3-dimensional colonies, ES cells depleted of any the 7
Tip60-p400 HAT components showed a flattened and elongated morphology,
with monolayer growth and reduced cell-cell contacts. These knockdown
cells continued to cycle, with reduced cells in S phase and increased
cells in G2 phase. The effect of Tip60-p400 HAT component knockdown was
unique to ES cells, as negligible changes were observed following
knockdown in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Makino et al. (1998) detected a high level of autoantibodies against
TIP49 in sera of patients with the autoimmune diseases
polymyositis/dermatomyositis and autoimmune hepatitis.

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of a protein
subunit, TERT (187270), an RNA subunit, TERC (602322), and the
TERC-binding protein dyskerin (DKC1; 300126). Using affinity
chromatography and mass spectrometry, Venteicher et al. (2008)
identified pontin and reptin (RUVBL2) as components of the telomerase
complex in HeLa cells. Pontin interacted directly with both TERT and
dyskerin. The amount of TERT bound to pontin and reptin peaked in S
phase. Depletion of pontin and reptin impaired telomerase RNP
accumulation, indicating an essential role for these proteins in
telomerase assembly.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Qiu et al. (1998) mapped the
RUVBL1 gene to chromosome 3q21.

607268	TITLE *607268 CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 1; CHRAC1
;;CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY COMPLEX, 15-KD SUBUNIT; CHRAC15;;
NFYC-LIKE PROTEIN 1; YCL1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CHRAC1 is a histone-fold protein that interacts with other histone-fold
proteins to bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner. These
histone-fold protein dimers combine within larger enzymatic complexes
for DNA transcription, replication, and packaging.

CLONING

Poot et al. (2000) identified CHRAC1, which they designated CHRAC15, or
p15, within a chromatin remodeling complex, CHRAC, purified from HeLa
cell nuclear extracts. The protein contains 131 amino acids and shows an
apparent molecular mass of 15 kD by SDS-PAGE. The putative histone-fold
domain of CHRAC1 has similarity to the H2A-type histone-fold domain of
CBFC (NFYC; 605344). Northern blot analysis revealed variable but
ubiquitous expression of a 2.4-kb transcript that paralleled the
expression of another histone-fold protein, CHRAC17 (POLE3; 607267).

Bolognese et al. (2000) cloned mouse Chrac1, which they designated Ycl1.
The deduced 129-amino acid protein is highly acidic and contains a short
N terminus, a central 65-amino acid histone-fold motif, and a short C
terminus that is rich in lysine and acidic residues. The authors noted
that there is a high degree of phylogenetic conservation that extends
beyond the histone-fold motif. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 1.2-kb transcript in all mouse cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Poot et al. (2000) affinity purified a human chromatin remodeling
complex, CHRAC, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts using antibody that
cross-reacts with the SNF2H (SMARCA5; 603375) and SNF2L (see 300012)
isoforms of human ISWI but does not distinguish between them. POLE3,
CHRAC1, and BAZ1A (605680), which the authors called ACF1,
coimmunoprecipitated within this ISWI-containing complex, and the
authors determined that the complex contains predominantly the SNF2H
isoform of ISWI. Using pull-down assays with recombinant proteins, Poot
et al. (2000) found that POLE3 and CHRAC1 interact directly with each
other, and they concluded that the H2B-type histone-fold domain of POLE3
likely interacts with the H2A-type histone-fold domain of CHRAC1. They
confirmed high-affinity DNA-binding activity for the POLE3-CHRAC1
complex, with a dissociation constant in the submicromolar range. POLE3
and CHRAC1 did not interact individually with DNA, and the POLE3-CHRAC1
complex did not interact well with nucleosomes.

Using an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay between recombinant
mouse proteins and nuclear extracts, Bolognese et al. (2000) confirmed
heterodimerization between Pole3 and Chrac1. In nucleosome
reconstitution assays, the Pole3-Chrac1 dimer formed complexes with
histones in solution and on DNA.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to an EST (GenBank GENBANK AI931369),
Bolognese et al. (2000) mapped the CHRAC1 gene to chromosome 8q11-q12.
