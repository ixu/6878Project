;;EXOCYST COMPLEX COMPONENT 3-LIKE 3; EXOC3L3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

TNF (191160) is a proinflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic effects on
cells and tissues, mediated mostly by alterations in target tissue gene
expression. Using differential hybridization to identify primary
response genes induced by TNF in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs), Sarma et al. (1992) isolated a HUVEC cDNA encoding TNFAIP2.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb human TNFAIP2 transcript.
During mouse development, expression of the Tnfaip2 transcript varied in
a temporal fashion that was organ-specific. The TNFAIP2 cDNA encodes a
predicted 654-amino acid protein with a single N-linked glycosylation
site; stretches of glutamates, lysines, and alanines near the N
terminus; and 4 glutamines near the C terminus. Immunoprecipitation
studies confirmed the calculated molecular mass of 73 kD. Sarma et al.
(1992) used Southern blot analysis to show that TNFAIP2 is an
evolutionarily conserved single-copy gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Sarma et al. (1992) found that the TNFAIP2 gene was induced in HUVECs in
response to the proinflammatory molecules TNF, IL1B (147720), and
lipopolysaccharide. TNFAIP2 demonstrated the characteristics of a
primary response gene in its rapid and substantial induction in the
absence of intermediary protein synthesis. The authors found that
TNFAIP2 transcription was induced during capillary tube formation in
vitro.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Sarma et al. (1992) localized the TNFAIP2 gene to chromosome 14q32.

603189	TITLE *603189 SYNTAXIN 5; STX5
;;STX5A
DESCRIPTION In eukaryotic cells, vesicle docking is thought to be regulated in part
by the specific interactions of a vesicle-associated membrane protein
(VAMP), or synaptobrevin (e.g., 185880), with the presynaptic plasma
membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP25 (600322). By PCR using
oligonucleotides based on the sequence of rat syntaxin-5, Ravichandran
and Roche (1997) isolated a partial cDNA encoding human syntaxin-5. They
used the partial cDNA to clone a full-length human syntaxin-5 cDNA from
an EBV-transformed lymphocyte cell cDNA library. The predicted 301-amino
acid human protein is 96% identical to rat syntaxin-5. In vitro, human
syntaxin-5 bound efficiently to rat VAMP2 (see SYB2; 185881) but not to
human SNAP25.

To fuse transport vesicles with target membranes, proteins of the SNARE
complex must be located on both the vesicle and the target membrane. In
yeast, 4 integral membrane proteins, Sed5, Bos1, Sec22 (see 604029), and
Bet1 (605456) each are believed to contribute a single helix to form the
SNARE complex that is needed for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to
Golgi. This generates a 4-helix bundle, which ultimately mediates the
actual fusion event. Parlati et al. (2000) explored how the anchoring
arrangement of the 4 helices affects their ability to mediate fusion.
Parlati et al. (2000) reconstituted 2 populations of phospholipid
bilayer vesicles, with the individual SNARE proteins distributed in all
possible combinations between them. Of the 8 nonredundant permutations
of 4 subunits distributed over 2 vesicle populations, only 1 resulted in
membrane fusion. Fusion occurred only when the v-SNARE Bet1 is on 1
membrane and the syntaxin heavy chain Sed5 and its 2 light chains, Bos1
and Sec22, are on the other membrane, where they form a functional
t-SNARE. Thus, each SNARE protein is topologically restricted by design
to function either as a v-SNARE or as part of a t-SNARE complex.

Windpassinger et al. (2003) observed that Human Genome Project sequence
data indicated that the STX5A gene is located on 11q12-q14, the region
to which the locus for Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685) had
been mapped. They excluded STX5A as the mutant gene, as no mutations
were found on sequence analysis of at least 2 affected individuals from
each of 4 different families and 1 healthy control.

;;YME1L;;
YME1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 1;;
PRESENILIN-ASSOCIATED METALLOPROTEASE; PAMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

YME1L1 shares significant homology with 3 members of the AAA superfamily
of metalloproteases from S. cerevisiae, Afg3 (see 603020), Rca1, and
Yme1. In yeast, these proteins are localized to the mitochondrial inner
membrane, where they perform roles in the assembly and turnover of
respiratory chain complexes.

CLONING

Using database analysis, conventional screening, and 5-prime RACE,
Coppola et al. (2000) cloned YME1L1 from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced 716-amino acid protein contains an AAA consensus sequence, an
ATP/GTP-binding motif, and a zinc-dependent binding domain. YME1L1
shares 50% sequence identity with yeast Yme1, 40% identity with yeast
Rca1, and 39% identity with yeast Afg3, with highest homology in the
central regions of the proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed
transcripts of about 2.6 and 4.4 kb in all tissues examined, with
greatest abundance in adult heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. The
shorter transcript likely results from the use of an alternate
polyadenylation site. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos revealed
ubiquitous expression. YME1L1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells showed a
granular cytoplasmic localization, with higher density of puncta around
the nucleus, and colocalization with a mitochondrial marker.

Using the C termini of presenilin-1 (PSEN1; 104311) and presenilin-2
(PSEN2; 600759) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA
library, followed by screening a liver cDNA library, Pellegrini et al.
(2001) cloned YME1L1, which they designated PAMP. Northern blot analysis
detected 2 PAMP transcripts with different 3-prime untranslated regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast strain in which the Yme1 gene was disrupted, Shah et al.
(2000) found that transfection and expression of YME1L1 restored growth
under conditions that were lethal to the Yme1-disrupted cells. Shah et
al. (2000) concluded that YME1L1 plays a phylogenetically conserved role
in mitochondrial protein metabolism.

GENE STRUCTURE

Coppola et al. (2000) determined that the YME1L1 gene contains 19 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Coppola et al. (2000) mapped the YME1L1
gene to chromosome 10q14. However, Gross (2008) mapped the YME1L1 gene
to chromosome 10p12.1 based on an alignment of the YME1L1 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AJ132637) with the genomic sequence (build 36.3).

DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. See
NDUFA2 (602137). By a combination of EST database searching and PCR,
Loeffen et al. (1998) isolated human cDNAs encoding NDUFC2 and 7 other
complex I subunits. The predicted 119-amino acid human protein is 74%
identical to B14.5B, the bovine homolog.

602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

604602	TITLE *604602 RIBOSOME-RECYCLING FACTOR, MITOCHONDRIAL; MRRF
;;RRF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The termination of protein synthesis requires the action of several
auxiliary factors. In bacteria, ribosome-recycling factor (Rrf) is
essential for the release of ribosomes from the mRNA at the stop codon.
Mitochondria perform protein synthesis using a translation system that
has some features reminiscent of prokaryotic translation and other
features that are unique. By searching an EST database using the E. coli
Rrf protein sequence as the query, Zhang and Spremulli (1998) identified
human ESTs encoding mitochondrial ribosome-recycling factor (MRRF). They
assembled the complete MRRF coding sequence using ESTs. Sequence
analysis of the deduced 263-amino acid MRRF protein indicated that it is
likely localized in the mitochondria; however, MRRF does not have a
clear cleavage signal for removal of the signal peptide. Human MRRF
shares approximately 25 to 30% amino acid sequence identity with
bacterial RRFs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays with recombinant human proteins, Tsuboi et al.
(2009) showed that RRF interacted directly with EFG2 (GFM2; 606544) and
that both were required for ribosome dissociation from mRNA. GTP, but
not GTP hydrolysis, was also required. GTP hydrolysis by EFG2 appeared
to follow the ribosome splitting reaction and occurred on the ribosomal
large subunit. EFG2 and RRF remained on the large subunit until GTP was
hydrolyzed and prevented reassociation of subunits.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (2000) assigned the MRRF
gene to chromosome 9q32-q34.1.

609473	TITLE *609473 CINGULIN, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; CGN
;;KIAA1319
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CGN, which they designated
KIAA1319. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest CGN expression in liver, testis,
and lung. Intermediate expression was detected in ovary, pancreas,
spinal cord, whole adult brain, fetal liver and brain, and all specific
brain regions examined. No expression was detected in heart, skeletal
muscle, and spleen.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to Xenopus cingulin,
Citi et al. (2000) identified human cingulin. The deduced 1,203-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 137 kD. Cingulin
contains a globular N-terminal head region, a central coiled-coil rod
domain, and a short C-terminal tail. It has a leucine zipper motif,
classical and bipartite nuclear localization signals, and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Human and Xenopus cingulin share 43%
amino acid identity, with highest similarity in the C-terminal tail and
lowest similarity in the N-terminal head domain. Northern blot analysis
detected a 5.2-kb transcript in pancreas, kidney, liver, and lung, but
not in skeletal muscle, placenta, brain, and heart.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Citi et al. (2000) determined that each cingulin molecule is likely to
be a dimer, with the alpha-helical sequences of each subunit assembled
in parallel axial register to form a 2-stranded coiled-coil. Cingulin
dimers may further assemble through antiparallel interactions between
the last 100 amino acids of the coiled-coil region.

GENE FUNCTION

Citi et al. (2000) found that both human and Xenopus cingulin interacted
with canine Zo1 (TJP1; 601009) and Zo2 (TJP2; 607709) in an in vitro
pull-down assay.

D'Atri et al. (2002) found that overexpression of Xenopus cingulin in
transfected Xenopus epithelial cells resulted in disruption of
endogenous Zo1 localization. Pull-down experiments with truncated
Xenopus and human cingulin showed that the N-terminal motifs
independently bound Zo1 and Zo2. Deletion of the Zo1 interaction motif
did not abolish junctional localization of cingulin in transfected
Xenopus epithelial cells, indicating that multiple protein interactions
can recruit cingulin to tight junctions in these cells. D'Atri et al.
(2002) demonstrated that the coiled-coil region of cingulin acts
primarily to promote dimerization.

RhoA (ARHA; 165390) is downregulated when epithelial cells reach
confluence, resulting in inhibition of signaling pathways that stimulate
proliferation. By coimmunoprecipitation, Aijaz et al. (2005) identified
cingulin as a binding partner of endogenous Gefh1 (ARHGEF2; 607560), a
guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA, in Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells. Cingulin binding inhibited RhoA activation and
signaling, suggesting that the increase in cingulin expression in
confluent cells inhibits Gefh1 and thereby downregulates RhoA. In
agreement, RNA interference of Gefh1 or transfection of a mutant Gefh1
unable to bind cingulin inhibited G1/S phase transition in MDCK cells.
Depletion of cingulin by regulated RNA interference resulted in RhoA
activation and the development of irregular cell monolayers. Aijaz et
al. (2005) concluded that the formation of epithelial tight junctions
contributes to the downregulation of RhoA by inactivating Gefh1 in a
cingulin-dependent manner.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Citi et al. (2000) mapped the CGN gene to
chromosome 1q21.

CUG-BINDING PROTEIN; CUGBP;;
NUCLEAR POLYADENYLATED RNA-BINDING PROTEIN, 50-KD; NAB50;;
BRUNO-LIKE 2; BRUNOL2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF1, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

An unstable CTG triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene (605377) is
responsible for myotonic dystrophy (DM1; 160900). To detect proteins
that bind to CTG triplet repeats, Timchenko et al. (1996) performed
bandshift analysis using as probes double-stranded DNA fragments having
CTG repeats and single-stranded oligonucleotides having CTG repeats or
RNA CUG repeats. The proteins were derived from nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts of HeLa cells, fibroblasts, and myotubes. Proteins binding to
the double-stranded DNA repeat were inhibited by the nonlabeled repeat
but not by a nonspecific DNA fragment. Another protein binding to the
single-stranded CTG probe and the RNA CUG probe was inhibited by
nonlabeled CTG(8) and CUG(8) repeats. The protein binding only to the
RNA repeat (CUG)8 was inhibited by nonlabeled (CUG)8 but not by
nonlabeled single- or double-stranded CTG repeats. Furthermore, the
protein, designated CUG-binding protein (CUGBP) by the authors,
exhibited no binding to an RNA oligonucleotide of triplet repeats of the
same length but having a different sequence, CGG. The CUG-binding
protein was localized to the cytoplasm, whereas double-stranded DNA
binding proteins were localized to the nuclear extract. Thus, Timchenko
et al. (1996) concluded that several trinucleotide-binding proteins
exist and their specificity is determined by the triplet sequence.

CTG trinucleotide repeats encode CUG repeat regions in the corresponding
mRNAs. Timchenko et al. (1996) identified 2 proteins, termed CUGBP1 and
CUGBP2, that bind specifically to CUG repeats in RNA. They suggested
that these 2 proteins, with masses of 49 kD and 51 kD, respectively, are
isoforms encoded by the same gene. Timchenko et al. (1996) cloned a
gene, termed NAB50 by them, based on the interaction between its protein
product and the yeast Nab2 protein. The authors stated that the NAB50
gene encodes the CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 proteins because anti-Nab50
antibodies crossreacted with both CUGBP isoforms. The gene predicts a
482-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52 kD. The
predicted protein contains 3 RNA-binding domains and is homologous to
the hnRNPs.

Good et al. (2000) identified CUGBP1 as BRUNOL2, a member of a human
gene family related to the transcriptional regulator 'Bruno' of
Drosophila. By PCR, they cloned BRUNOL2 from a brain cDNA library. The
deduced protein contains 2 N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a
long linker region, and a C-terminal RRM. BRUNOL2 and BRUNOL3 (CUGBP2;
602538) share 80% amino acid identity overall and more than 92% identity
in their RRMs. Good et al. (2000) determined that the BRUNOL2 cDNA and
the CUGBP1 cDNA reported by Timchenko et al. (1996) differ in their
3-prime UTRs due to alternative splicing. Good et al. (2000) also
identified a BRUNOL2 splice variant with an additional 12 bp, resulting
in a 4-amino acid insertion in the linker region. Northern blot analysis
detected variable expression of 3 major BRUNOL2 transcripts of about
9.5, 7.5, and 2.4 kb in all tissues examined.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) confirmed ubiquitous
expression of CUGBP1.

GENE FUNCTION

Timchenko et al. (1996) showed that the NAB50 gene product bound the CUG
repeat region of DMPK.

Using 2 biologic systems with reduced DMPK levels, a homozygous DM
patient and DMPK knockout mice, Roberts et al. (1997) demonstrated that
the intracellular distribution of CUGBP isoforms was altered in the
absence of DMPK. DMPK phosphorylated the CUGBP protein in vitro,
suggesting regulation of nuclear CUGBP localization via phosphorylation.

Using ultraviolet light crosslinking and gel mobility shift assays, Good
et al. (2000) showed that BRUNOL2 bound RNA containing a BRUNO response
element (BRE).

Dudaronek et al. (2007) showed that Ifnb (147720) induced expression of
Lip, a truncated, dominant-negative isoform of Cebpb (189965), and
suppressed active simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication in
macaque macrophages. In a human monocyte cell line, IFNB induced
phosphorylation of CUGBP1 and formation of CUGBP1-CEBPB mRNA complexes.
Depletion of Cugbp1 in macaque macrophages via small interfering RNA
showed that Cugbp1 was required for Ifnb-mediated induction of Lip and
for Ifnb-mediated suppression of SIV replication. Dudaronek et al.
(2007) concluded that CUGBP1 is a downstream effector of IFNB signaling
in primary macrophages that plays an important role in innate immune
responses controlling acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or SIV
replication in brain.

containing 90 CGG repeats is expressed specifically in the eye results
in disorganized ommatidia, depigmentation, and progressive loss of
photoreceptor neurons. Sofola et al. (2007) found that overexpression of
human CUGBP1 suppressed the neurodegenerative eye phenotype in
transgenic flies. CUGBP1 did not interact directly with the CGG repeats,
but did so via HNRNPA2B1 (600124). Expression of the A2 isoform of human
HNRNPA2B1, or the Drosophila orthologs, also suppressed the eye
phenotype of FXTAS flies. CUGBP1 did not interact with other HNRNPs
examined.

Tang et al. (2012) observed altered splicing of the calcium channel
subunit CAV1.1 (CACNA1S; 114208) in muscle of patients with DM1 and DM2
(602668) compared with normal adult muscle and muscle of patients with
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD; see 158900). A significant
fraction of CAV1.1 transcripts in DM1 and DM2 muscle showed skipping of
exon 29, which represents a fetal splicing pattern. Forced exclusion of
exon 29 in normal mouse skeletal muscle altered channel gating
properties and increased current density and peak electrically evoked
calcium transient magnitude. Downregulation of Mbnl1 (606516) in mouse
cardiac muscle or overexpression of Cugbp1 in mouse tibialis anterior
muscle enhanced skipping of exon 29, suggesting that these splicing
factors may be involved in the CAV1.1 splicing defect in myotonic
dystrophy.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the CUGBP1 gene
to chromosome 11p11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2007) generated an inducible and heart-specific mouse model
of DM1 that expressed expanded human DMPK CUG-repeat RNA and
recapitulated pathologic features of the human disorder, including
dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and systolic and diastolic
dysfunction. The mice also showed misregulation of developmental
alternative splicing transitions, including the Tnnt2 (191045) and Fxr1
(600819) genes. All died of heart failure within 2 weeks.
Immunohistochemical studies showed increased CUGBP1 protein levels
specifically in nuclei containing foci of DMPK CUG-repeat RNA. A
time-course study showed that increased CUGBP1 cooccurred within hours
of induced expression of the CUG repeat and coincided with reversion to
embryonic splicing patterns. The results indicated that increased CUGBP1
is a specific and early event of DM1 pathogenesis and represents a
primary response to expression of DMPK CUG-repeat mutant RNA.

Koshelev et al. (2010) expressed human CUGBP1 in adult mouse heart.
Upregulation of CUGBP1 was sufficient to reproduce molecular,
histopathologic, and functional changes observed in a DM1 mouse model
that expressed expanded CUG RNA repeats (Wang et al., 2007) as well as
in individuals with DM1. The authors concluded that CUGBP1 upregulation
plays an important role in DM1 pathogenesis.

By inducing expression of human CUGBP1 in adult skeletal muscle of
transgenic mice, Ward et al. (2010) showed that the pathogenic features
of DM1 could be explained by upregulated CUGBP1 expression. Within weeks
of induction of CUGBP1 expression, transgenic mice exhibited impaired
movement, reduced muscle function, abnormal gait, and reduced total body
weight compared with uninduced controls. Histologic analysis of
transgenic muscle overexpressing CUGBP1 revealed centrally located
nuclei, myofiber degeneration with inflammatory infiltrate, and pyknotic
nuclear clumps. RT-PCR analysis revealed reversion to embryonic splicing
patterns in several genes in transgenic muscle overexpressing CUGBP1.
Ward et al. (2010) concluded that CUGBP1 has a major role in DM1
skeletal muscle pathogenesis.

602123	TITLE *602123 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-GAMMA; CAMK2G
;;CaM KINASE II GAMMA SUBUNIT;;
CAMKG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in
diverse effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that utilize Ca(2+) as
a second messenger. The enzyme is an oligomeric protein composed of
distinct but related subunits, alpha (114078), beta (607707), gamma, and
delta (607708), each encoded by a separate gene. Each subunit has
alternatively spliced variants.

CLONING

Breen and Ashcroft (1997) cloned and sequenced a novel CaM kinase
II-gamma cDNA from human islet cell RNA. This isoform, designated
gamma-SRP by the authors, encodes a truncated gamma CaM kinase II in
which the 3-prime end consists of 804 basepairs of the human SRP72 gene
(602122).

Tombes and Krystal (1997) identified a number of CAMKG variants
expressed by neuronal cells. Two variants were consistently expressed in
nonneuronal cell lines, and another was preferentially expressed in
tumor cells.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Li et al. (1994) mapped the CAMK2G gene to human
chromosome 10q22. Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that CAMK2G is 1 of 3 genes
that are nested in the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse cardiomyocytes, Zhu et al. (2003) demonstrated that
beta-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1; 109630)-induced apoptosis was
resistant to inhibition of PKA (see 176911). Rather, the Adrb1
proapoptotic effect was associated with non-Pka-dependent increases in
intracellular Ca(2+) and Camk2 activity. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+)
channel (see 114205), buffering intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibiting
Camk2 activity fully protected cardiomyocytes against Adrb1-induced
apoptosis; overexpressing the c splice variant of Camk2d markedly
exaggerated the Adrb1 apoptotic effect. Zhu et al. (2003) concluded that
CAMK2 constitutes a PKA-independent linkage of ADRB1 stimulation to
cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Among 304 Swiss individuals tested and genotyped, de Quervain and
Papassotiropoulos (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00008)
between short-term episodic memory performance and genetic variations in
a 7-gene cluster consisting of the ADCY8 (103070), PRKACG (176893),
CAMK2G, GRIN2A (138253), GRIN2B (138252), GRM3 (601115), and PRKCA
(176960) genes, all of which have well-established molecular and
biologic functions in animal memory. Functional MRI studies in an
independent set of 32 individuals with similar memory performance showed
a correlation between activation in memory-related brain regions,
including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and genetic
variability in the 7-gene cluster. De Quervain and Papassotiropoulos
(2006) concluded that these 7 genes encode proteins of the memory
formation signaling cascade that are important for human memory
function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of mutation in the CAMK2G gene as a possible cause of an
intellectual disability phenotype, see 602123.0001.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of CaMKII in T cells, Bui et al. (2000) generated
transgenic mice expressing a partially calcium-independent mutant form
of CAMKG (thr287 to asp). The size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to
2-fold in these mice, at least in part due to an increase in the life
span of double-positive thymocytes. There was an increase in the number
of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an
antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bona fide memory
cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from
wildtype mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several
rounds of antigen-stimulated division. The authors proposed that CaMKII
controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular
differentiation.

Using gene targeting, Zhang et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of
cardiac Camk2 inhibition and demonstrated substantial prevention of
maladaptive remodeling from excessive beta-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induction of balanced changes
in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and
beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated physiologic increases in cardiac
function. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that CAMK2 is a determinant of
clinically important heart disease phenotypes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CAMK2G, ARG292PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy with severe intellectual disability with self mutilation,
myopia, strabismus, mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial gene
defects, short stature, flat face with narrow forehead, long palpebral
fissures, arched eyebrows, sacral dimple, short hands, brachydactyly,
and short feet, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
875G-C transversion resulting in an arg29-to-pro (R29P) substitution.
The patient had normal array and MLL2 testing.

611171	TITLE *611171 KIAA1598 GENE; KIAA1598
;;SHOOTIN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1598. The deduced protein
contains 446 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected very high expression in
adult brain, followed by liver, kidney, pancreas, and spinal cord.
Expression was moderate in heart, lung, spleen, testis, ovary, fetal
liver, and fetal brain, and low in adult skeletal muscle. Expression was
high in all specific adult brain regions examined, particularly in
thalamus and hippocampus.

By database analysis, Toriyama et al. (2006) determined that the
KIAA1598 gene, which they called SHOOTIN1, encodes a 456-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52.6 kD. KIAA1598 contains 3
coiled-coil domains and a proline-rich region.

GENE FUNCTION

Toriyama et al. (2006) found Shootin1 upregulated during polarization of
rat hippocampal neurons in culture. Expression fluctuated among multiple
neurites and eventually Shootin1 accumulated asymmetrically in a single
neurite, which led to axon induction and neuron polarization. Disturbing
the asymmetric organization of Shootin1 with excess Shootin1 disrupted
polarization, whereas repressing Shootin1 expression inhibited
polarization. Overexpression and RNA interference studies suggested that
Shootin1 was required for spatially localized phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(see PIK3CG; 601232) activity. Shootin1 showed anterograde transport to
the growth cones and diffused back to the soma, and inhibition of this
transport prevented its asymmetric accumulation in neurons. Toriyama et
al. (2006) proposed that Shootin1 is involved in the generation of
internal asymmetric signals required for neuronal polarization.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1598 gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH77773).

600944	TITLE *600944 DEOXYHYPUSINE SYNTHASE; DHPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Joe et al. (1995) stated that the unusual amino acid hypusine is formed
posttranslationally and is only found in a single cellular protein,
eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5A (EIF5A; see 600187).
Hypusine biosynthesis involves 2 enzymatic steps. In the first step,
deoxyhypusine synthase (EC 2.5.1.46) catalyzes the NAD-dependent
transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to the epsilon-amino
group of a specific lysine residue of the EIF5A precursor protein to
form the intermediate deoxyhypusine residue. In the second step,
mediated by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (611262), the conversion of the
deoxyhypusine residue to the hypusine residue completes EIF5A
maturation. Hypusine is found in all eukaryotes and in some
archaebacteria, but not in eubacteria. The amino acid sequence of EIF5A
is highly conserved, especially in the region surrounding the hypusine
residue, suggesting an important fundamental function for this protein
throughout eukaryotic evolution. Hypusine and EIF5A appear to be vital
for cell proliferation in eukaryotes.

CLONING

Joe et al. (1995) isolated cDNA clones encoding deoxyhypusine synthase
from a human HeLa cell library. Full-length cDNA clones encoding a
369-amino acid protein (calculated molecular mass of 40,970 Da) and a
shorter cDNA clone (that would potentially encode a protein with an
internal deletion of 56 amino acids) were isolated. The deduced amino
acid sequence of the human enzyme showed a high degree of identity to
that of the yeast enzyme.

From a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cDNA library, Bevec et
al. (1996) isolated 2 independent sequences encoding biologically active
deoxyhypusine synthase. DNA sequence analysis predicted a 369-amino acid
protein with a molecular mass of 41,055 Da.

GENE FUNCTION

Bevec et al. (1996) demonstrated that recombinant DHPS showed
significant catalytic activity in synthesis of deoxyhypusine after in
vitro transcription and translation as well as on expression in
Escherichia coli.

Hauber et al. (2005) demonstrated that inhibition of DHPS by the
experimental drug CNI-1493 or RNA interference efficiently suppressed
retroviral replication in cell culture and primary cells with no
measurable drug-induced adverse effects on cell cycle transition,
apoptosis, or general cytotoxicity. They showed that the antiviral
effect of CNI-1493 was due to inhibition of the HIV-1 Rev regulatory
protein, for which the hypusine-requiring EIF5A is a cofactor.

MAPPING

Using a panel of somatic rodent/human cell hybrids, Bevec et al. (1996)
localized the DHPS gene to human chromosome 19. Jones et al. (1996)
localized the DHPS gene to 19p13.12-p13.11, using fluorescence in situ
hybridization analysis in a combination with somatic human/rodent
translocation hybrid analysis.

600875	TITLE *600875 ACYLPHOSPHATASE, ERYTHROCYTE; ACYP1
;;ACYPE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acylphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.7) is a small cytosolic enzyme with a
molecular mass of 11 kD that is expressed in many vertebrate tissues.
The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the carboxyl-phosphate bond of
acyl phosphates. Two isoenzymes have been isolated, called muscle
acylphosphatase (102595) and erythrocyte acylphosphatase on the basis of
their tissue localization (summary by Fiaschi et al., 1995).

CLONING

Liguri et al. (1986) reported the isolation and characterization of a
human erythrocyte acylphosphatase isoenzyme. The protein contains 98
amino acid residues; it has an acetylated N terminus and does not
contain cysteine. It shares 56% sequence identity with human muscle
acylphosphatase. The erythrocyte enzyme showed hydrolytic activity on
acyl phosphates with higher affinity than the muscle enzyme for some
substrates and phosphorylated inhibitors.

Fiaschi et al. (1995) isolated and characterized 3 independent cDNAs
coding for the erythrocyte isoform. All the clones were incomplete at
the 5-prime end, but Northern blot analysis using cDNA as a probe showed
the presence of an unusually long 5-prime untranslated region in the
mRNA.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and FISH, Fiaschi et al. (1998)

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SULT1A1 gene encodes a phenol sulfotransferase (STP, or PST) (EC
2.8.2.1), which catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of catecholamines and
of phenolic drugs. There are 3 phenol-preferring SULT isoforms encoded
by 3 genes, SULT1A1, SULT1A2 (601292), and SULT1A3 (600641), which have
also been referred to as STP1, STP2, and STM, respectively. These genes
are highly homologous and are located within a 120-kb region on
chromosome 16p. SULT enzymes are widely distributed in human and animal
tissues, including blood platelets (summary by Raftogianis et al.,
1997).

CLONING

Wilborn et al. (1993) cloned cDNAs encoding SULT1A1, which they called
PPST, from a human liver cDNA library. The full-length cDNA encodes a
deduced 295-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34.1
kD. The rat and human proteins share 89% amino acid similarity. Northern
blot analysis of human liver detected a 1.3-kb mRNA transcript.

Using PCR, Jones et al. (1995) cloned PPST from human platelet and liver
cDNA libraries.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dooley and Huang (1996) determined the genomic organization of the human
SULT1A1, SULT1A2, and SULT1A3 genes. These 3 genes each have 8 exons
with the initiator methionine in exon 2. All 3 colocalize on a single
cosmid and have a high degree of sequence homology, suggesting that
these 3 genes arose by gene duplication. Dooley and Huang (1996) stated
that the previously identified PST gene sequences PPST, HPST, HAST1, and
HAST2 are isolates of the SULT1A1 gene.

Wilborn et al. (1993) determined that SULT1A1 has 3 putative
polyadenylation signal sequences.

MAPPING

By screening DNA samples from a human-hamster somatic cell hybrid panel
by PCR using an oligonucleotide primer pair, Dooley et al. (1993) mapped
the SULT1A1 gene to human chromosome 16p. PCR amplification on a
human-mouse somatic cell hybrid panel containing defined portions of
chromosome 16 showed that SULT1A1 is located proximal to the gene for
protein kinase C, beta-1 polypeptide (176970), in the region
16p12.1-p11.2.

Her et al. (1996) identified a second thermostable phenol
sulfotransferase, SULT1A2, which also maps to chromosome 16; see 601292.
Raftogianis et al. (1996) found that the SULT1A1 gene is located
approximately 45 kb 5-prime upstream from the SULT1A2 gene.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Dooley et al. (1993) mapped the
mouse Sult1a1 gene to chromosome 7. Khan et al. (1995) also mapped the
Sult1a1 gene to mouse chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Wilborn et al. (1993) observed significant increases in sulfotransferase
activity toward 2 PST-specific substrates, minoxidil and 4-nitrophenol,
in cytosol prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with human PPST. PPST
appeared to function as a homodimer.

By assaying transfected Chinese hamster fibroblasts, Jones et al. (1995)
showed that cytosolic human PPST sulfated 1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, and
phenol. It showed lower activity with tyramine, dopamine, noradrenalin,
and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, and had no activity toward
dehydroepiandrosterone and estrone.

Kester et al. (1999) investigated sulfation of the prohormone T4, the
active hormone T3, and the metabolites rT3 and 3,3-prime-diiodothyronine
(3,3-prime-T2) by human liver and kidney cytosol sulfotransferases as
well as by recombinant human SULT1A1 and SULT1A3. In all cases, the most
preferred substrate was 3,3-prime-T2, followed by rT3, T3, and T4 (most
preferred to least preferred, respectively). These results indicated
similar substrate specificities for iodothyronine sulfation by native
human liver and kidney sulfotransferases and recombinant SULT1A1 and
SULT1A3. Of the latter, SULT1A1 clearly showed the highest affinity for
iodothyronines, but it remained to be established whether SULT1A1 is the
prominent isoenzyme for sulfation of thyroid hormone in human liver and
kidney.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Gamage et al. (2003) solved the crystal structure of SULT1A1 to
1.9-angstrom resolution. They found that, like other SULTs, SULT1A1
formed a central 5-stranded parallel beta sheet surrounded on either
side by helices. The L-shaped substrate-binding site was highly
hydrophobic and accommodated 2 p-nitrophenol molecules. Kinetic analysis
revealed a slight deviation from Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low
concentrations of p-nitrophenol, suggestive of positive cooperativity,
although higher concentrations resulted in substrate inhibition. The
substrate-binding site accepted a single T2 molecule, with the 2 phenyl
rings of T2 occupying each of the 2 p-nitrophenol-binding sites. The
substrate 17-beta-estradiol caused a conformational change in the
SULT1A1 substrate-binding site, suggesting that this rearrangement
underlies the low affinity SULT1A1 shows toward this sterol.

Using molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic
analysis, Barnett et al. (2004) showed that phe247 of SULT1A1 interacted
with both p-nitrophenol molecules in the active site and was required
for substrate inhibition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Evidence that inheritance contributes to differences in levels of the 2
forms of the SULT1A1 enzyme in Caucasians was presented by Reveley et
al. (1982), Price et al. (1988), and Van Loon and Weinshilboum (1984).

Anderson and Jackson (1984) showed that the mean basal level of platelet
thermostable PST (TS PST) activity in American blacks is significantly
higher than the mean basal level in whites, whereas the average platelet
thermolabile PST activity does not differ significantly between the 2
groups. Anderson et al. (1988) suggested that the findings are a first
step toward testing the hypothesis that inheritance may be a factor in
the regulation of basal levels of activity and thermostability of
platelet PST.

Raftogianis et al. (1997) identified a common variant allele of the
SULT1A1 gene, termed SULT1A1*2 (dbSNP rs9282861), that was uniformly
associated with both very low TS PST activity and low thermal stability.
The variant allele, 638G-A transition in exon 7, resulted in an
arg213-to-his (R213H) substitution. The allele frequency of SULT1A1*2 in
a population sample of 150 Caucasian blood donors was 0.31 (31%),
indicating that approximately 9% of this population would be homozygous
for that allele. Overall, Raftogianis et al. (1997) identified 13
SULT1A1 alleles encoding 4 allozymes.

Coughtrie et al. (1999) found the variant SULT1A1*2 allele at
frequencies of 0.321 and 0.269 in 293 U.K. Caucasian and 52 Nigerian
African individuals, respectively. This allele codes for an allozyme
with low enzyme activity and stability compared to the wildtype
(SULT1A1*1) enzyme. Therefore, the SULT1A1 genotype may influence
susceptibility to mutagenicity following exposure to heterocyclic amines
and other environmental toxins. Accordingly, Coughtrie et al. (1999)
found an age-related difference in SULT1A1 genotype within the Caucasian
population, with increasing incidence of SULT1A1*1 homozygosity and
decreasing incidence of SULT1A1*2 homozygosity with increasing age.
These findings suggested a possible association of SULT1A1*1 allozyme
with protection against cell or tissue damage during aging.

Bamber et al. (2001) compared the frequency of the most common SULT1A1
alleles in 226 colorectal cancer patients and 293 previously described
control patients. There was no significant difference in allele
frequency between the control and cancer patient populations, nor was
there a significant association with any of the clinical parameters
studied, including Duke classification, differentiation, site, nodal
involvement, and survival. However, when the age-related difference in
allele frequency was considered, a significantly reduced risk of
colorectal cancer was associated with homozygosity for SULT1A1*1 (odds
ratio = 0.47) in subjects under the age of 80 years. These results
suggested that the high activity SULT1A1*1 alloallele protects against
dietary and/or environmental chemicals involved in the pathogenesis of
colorectal cancer.

Using a quantitative multiplex PCR assay, Hebbring et al. (2007) found
that 17 (4.7%) of 362 Caucasian American individuals had 1 copy of the
SULT1A1 gene (i.e., a deletion) and 26% had 3 or more copies. Among 99
African Americans tested, 62 (62.6%) had 3 or more copies. The
variability in the level of enzyme activity among 23 human platelet and
267 human liver samples was best explained by gene copy number
differences when all sources of genetic variability, including the
SULT1A1*2 allele, were considered (p less than 0.0001). Overall, these
results indicated that the presence of SULT1A1 gene deletions and
duplications represent the major source of variability in the metabolic
activity of this enzyme.

HISTORY

Early studies showed the existence of 2 phenol SULT isoforms based on
biochemical studies: a thermolabile, or monoamine-metabolizing (SULT1A3;
600641), form and a thermostable, or phenol-metabolizing, form (SULT1A1)
(summary by Raftogianis et al., 1997).

607168	TITLE *607168 DYNEIN, LIGHT CHAIN, ROADBLOCK TYPE, 2; DYNLRB2
;;DYNEIN, LIGHT CHAIN 2B; DNLC2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for sequences homologous to rat robl/LC7-like
gene-1, Jiang et al. (2001) identified 2 members of the dynein family
that they designated DNLC2A (607167) and DNLC2B. Both DNLC2A and DNLC2B
encode deduced 96-amino acid proteins with molecular masses of 10.9 and
10.8 kD, respectively. The proteins share 77% sequence identity and show
high homology to robl/LC7 dynein proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected higher expression of DNLC2B than of DNLC2A in all normal
tissues tested except liver. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues of 68 Chinese patients showed
upregulation of DNLC2A in 45 cases and dowregulation of DNLC2B in 44
cases compared with adjacent tumor-free liver tissues. In 7 additional
cancer cell lines studied, DNLC2A was highly expressed in all, whereas
DNLC2B was highly expressed in only 1 HCC cell line.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pazour et al. (2006) mapped the DYNLRB2
gene to chromosome 16q23.3.
