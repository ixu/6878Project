KIAA1564
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CHD8, which they designated KIAA1564. The
deduced protein contains 1,417 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific brain
regions examined.

Sakamoto et al. (2000) cloned rat Chd8, which they called Duplin. The
deduced 749-amino acid protein was expressed mainly in the nuclear
fraction of transfected COS cells.

Ishihara et al. (2006) cloned mouse Chd8. The deduced 2,582-amino acid
protein has 2 chromodomains, followed by a central helicase/ATPase
domain and 2 C-terminal BRK domains. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous Chd8 expression in mouse tissues, with highest levels in
heart and testis. Western blot analysis of HeLa cells detected
endogenous CHD8 at an apparent molecular mass of 240 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakamoto et al. (2000) found that rat Duplin bound directly to the
armadillo repeats of beta-catenin (see CTNNB1; 116806) in the nuclei of
mammalian cells, thereby inhibiting binding of TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228) to
beta-catenin and beta-catenin-dependent activation of TCF4. Expression
of Duplin in Xenopus embryos inhibited axis formation and beta
catenin-dependent axis duplication, and it countered the ability of
beta-catenin to rescue ventralizing phenotypes induced by ultraviolet
irradiation. Sakamoto et al. (2000) concluded that Duplin is a nuclear
protein that negatively regulates Wnt (see 164820) signaling by binding
beta-catenin.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library, followed by
studies in COS cells, Kobayashi et al. (2002) found that importin-alpha
(see KPNA2; 600685) bound a cluster of basic amino acids in rat Duplin.
Interaction with importin-alpha caused Duplin to translocate to the
nucleus, and nuclear localization of Duplin was essential for inhibition
of Wnt-dependent activation of TCF4 in mammalian cells and
ventralization in Xenopus embryos. Additional experiments in Xenopus
embryos showed that Duplin also inhibited the Wnt signaling pathway
downstream of beta-catenin target genes.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and pull-down assays, Ishihara et al.
(2006) found that the C-terminal region of mouse Chd8 interacted with
the zinc finger domain of Ctcf (604167). Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis of a human hepatoma cell line revealed that CHD8 was present at
CTCF target sites, such as the differentially methylated region of H19
(103280), the locus control region of beta-globin (141900), and the
promoter regions of the BRCA1 (113705) and MYC (190080) genes.
Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated an endogenous complex of CHD8
and CTCF in HeLa cells. Knockdown of CHD8 in HeLa cells by RNA
interference abolished the CTCF-dependent insulator activity of the H19
differentially methylated region, leading to reactivation of imprinted
IGF2 (147470) from the maternal chromosome. Lack of CHD8 affected CpG
methylation and histone acetylation around the CTCF-binding sites, which
are adjacent to heterochromatin, of the BRCA1 and MYC genes. Ishihara et
al. (2006) concluded that CTCF-CHD8 has a role in insulation and
epigenetic regulation at active insulator sites.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid library screen, Batsukh et al. (2010) identified
CHD8 as an interacting partner of CHD7 (608892), mutations in which
cause the autosomal dominant malformation syndrome CHARGE (214800). In a
direct yeast 2-hybrid system, the CHD7-CHD8 interaction was disrupted by
CHD7 missense mutations found in CHARGE patients, including gly2108 to
arg (608892.0011), whereas in coimmunoprecipitation studies disruption
of the CHD7-CHD8 interaction by the mutations could not be observed. The
authors hypothesized that CHD7 and CHD8 proteins interact directly and
indirectly via additional linker proteins. Disruption of the direct
CHD7-CHD8 interaction may change the conformation of a putative large
CHD7-CHD8 complex and could be a disease mechanism in CHARGE syndrome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishiyama et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Chd8 gene contains 9
exons and spans about 13 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CHD8
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP G36016).

Nishiyama et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Duplin gene to chromosome 14.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

O'Roak et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing for parent-child
trios exhibiting sporadic autism spectrum disorders, including 189 new
trios and 20 that were previously reported (O'Roak et al., 2011). In
addition, O'Roak et al. (2012) sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected
sibs corresponding to 31 of the new and 19 of the previously reported
trios, for a total of 677 individual exomes from 209 families. In
proband exomes, O'Roak et al. (2012) found 2 de novo disruptive
mutations in CHD8, a nonsense mutation and a frameshift indel.

Sanders et al. (2012) combined all de novo events in their sample with
those identified in the study of O'Roak et al. (2012) and observed from
a total of 414 probands that the CHD8 gene carried 2 highly disruptive
mutations.

In a study of exonic de novo mutations in autism spectrum disorders (see
209850), Neale et al. (2012) identified 3 loss-of-function mutations in
the CHD8 gene among 935 cases and no mutations in CHD8 among 870
controls.

O'Roak et al. (2012) identified 9 de novo mutations in the CHD8 gene
among 2,446 autism spectrum probands. Seven were nonsense or frameshift
mutations, 1 was a splice site mutation, and 1 was an in-frame deletion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishiyama et al. (2004) found that development of Duplin -/- mouse
embryos was arrested at gastrulation, with the embryos manifesting
massive apoptosis. In contrast, Duplin +/- mice appeared normal and were
fertile. Expression of beta-catenin target genes was not increased in
Duplin -/- embryos, suggesting that the lack of Duplin did not result in
constitutive activation of Wnt signaling during embryogenesis.

;;AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE, NONCATALYTIC, GAMMA-1;;
AMPK-GAMMA-1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian 5-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to act
as a metabolic stress-sensing protein kinase. AMPK is a heterotrimeric
protein composed of a catalytic alpha subunit, a noncatalytic beta
subunit, and a noncatalytic gamma subunit. See PRKAA1 (602739) for
background.

CLONING

By PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides based on the rat Ampk-gamma-1
protein sequence, Woods et al. (1996) isolated rat liver cDNAs encoding
Ampk-gamma-1. Both the Ampk-gamma-1 mRNA and protein are widely
expressed in rat tissues. Gao et al. (1996) screened a human fetal liver
cDNA library with the rat Ampk-gamma-1 cDNA and isolated a cDNA encoding
AMPK-gamma-1. The predicted 331-amino acid human protein has a mass of
37.5 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

By site-directed mutagenesis, Hamilton et al. (2001) introduced an
arg70-to-glu mutation into PRKAG1. The mutation caused a marked increase
in AMPK activity, and the activity was largely AMP-independent.
Activation was associated with increased threonine phosphorylation
within the activation loop of the alpha subunit, PRKAA1. There was also
increased phosphorylation of one of its major substrates, acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (200350).

Minokoshi et al. (2004) investigated the potential role of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus in the regulation of food
intake. Minokoshi et al. (2004) reported that AMPK activity is inhibited
in arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus by the anorexigenic hormone
leptin (164160), and in multiple hypothalamic regions by insulin
(176730), high glucose, and refeeding. A melanocortin receptor (see
155555) agonist, a potent anorexigen, decreased AMPK activity in
paraventricular hypothalamus, whereas agouti-related protein (602311),
an orexigen, increased AMPK activity. Melanocortin receptor signaling is
required for leptin and refeeding effects of AMPK in the paraventricular
hypothalamus. Dominant-negative AMPK expression in the hypothalamus was
sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight, whereas constitutively
active AMPK increased both. Alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity
augmented changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression induced by fasting
and feeding. Furthermore, inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK is necessary
for leptin's effects on food intake and body weight, as constitutively
active AMPK blocks these effects. Thus, Minokoshi et al. (2004)
concluded that hypothalamic AMPK plays a critical role in hormonal and
nutrient-derived anorexigenic and orexigenic signals and in energy
balance.

Baba et al. (2006) showed that FNIP1 (610594) interacted with the alpha,
beta, and gamma subunits of AMPK. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK, and
its phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an AMPK
inhibitor, resulting in reduced FNIP1 expression. FLCN (607273)
phosphorylation was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation
and facilitated by FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN
phosphorylation may be regulated by mTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and AMPK
signaling. Baba et al. (2006) concluded that FLCN and FNIP1 may be
involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR
signaling pathways.

AMPK is an alpha-beta-gamma heterotrimer activated by decreasing
concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and increasing AMP
concentrations (summary by Oakhill et al., 2011). AMPK activation
depends on phosphorylation of the alpha catalytic subunit on thr172 by
kinases LKB1 (602216) or CaMKK-beta (CAMMK2; 615002), and this is
promoted by AMP binding to the gamma subunit. AMP sustains activity by
inhibiting dephosphorylation of alpha-thr172, whereas ATP promotes
dephosphorylation. Oakhill et al. (2011) found that adenosine
diphosphate (ADP), like AMP, bound to gamma sites 1 and 3 and stimulated
alpha-Thr172 phosphorylation. However, in contrast to AMP, ADP did not
directly activate phosphorylated AMPK. In this way, both ADP/ATP and
AMP/ATP ratios contribute to AMPK regulation.

MAPPING

Stapleton et al. (1997) mapped the human AMPK-gamma-1 gene to 12q13.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xiao et al. (2007) reported the crystal structure of the regulatory
fragment of mammalian AMPK in complexes with AMP and ATP. The phosphate
groups of AMP/ATP lie in a groove on the surface of the gamma domain,
which is lined with basic residues, many of which are associated with
disease-causing mutations. Structural and solution studies revealed that
2 sites on the gamma domain bind either AMP or magnesium ATP, whereas a
third site contains a tightly bound AMP that does not exchange. Xiao et
al. (2007) stated that their binding studies indicated that under
physiologic conditions AMPK mainly exists in its inactive form in
complex with magnesium ATP, which is much more abundant than AMP. Their
modeling studies suggested how changes in the concentration of AMP
enhance AMPK activity levels. The structure also suggested a mechanism
for propagating AMP/ATP signaling whereby a phosphorylated residue from
the alpha and/or beta subunits binds to the gamma subunit in the
presence of AMP but not when ATP is bound.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Molecular chaperones are proteins capable of folding or assembling
nascent proteins in a higher order structure. A molecular chaperone
called TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) plays a role in actin and tubulin
folding. TRiC is composed of 2 heteromeric subunits of 6 to 9 different
proteins. The cytoplasmic T-complex protein-1 (TCP1; 186980), an
abundant testicular germ cell protein, has been found in this complex.
Other components of TRiC, such as TRIC5, are TCP1-related proteins
(Sevigny et al., 1994).

CLONING

Joly et al. (1994) cloned a mouse cDNA corresponding to tryptic
fragments of the bovine TRiCP5 subunit described by Frydman et al.
(1992). The mouse TRiCP5 shares 48% nucleotide and 34% amino acid
homology with mouse Tcp1. It is a cytosolic protein also found in the
nuclear matrix of several cultured human cell lines. Furthermore, like
TCP1, it is highly expressed in testis.

Sevigny et al. (1994) cloned a partial human cDNA clone homologous to
mouse TRiCP5.

Walkley et al. (1996) cloned the human cDNA from a kidney library. The
1.9-kb cDNA encodes a predicted 544-amino acid protein that is 98%
similar to the mouse sequence and 75% similar to the yeast gene. The
mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues and at high levels in
mouse testis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) cloned the gene coding for the mouse P5 subunit.

GENE FUNCTION

Feldman et al. (1999) demonstrated that the folding and assembly of the
VHL protein (608537) into a complex with its partner proteins, elongin B
(600787) and elongin C (600788), is directly mediated by the chaperonin
TRiC. Their results defined a novel role for TRiC in mediating
oligomerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sevigny et al. (1996) determined that the mouse Tric5 gene contains 14
exons distributed within 25 kb of genomic DNA. Sevigny et al. (1996)
used primer extension to demonstrate multiple transcription start points
for the Tric5 gene. This was considered consistent with the lack of any
obvious TATA box upstream of the transcription start points.

MAPPING

Sevigny et al. (1994) mapped the TRIC5 gene to chromosome 1q23 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The fact that the human TRIC5 gene
is not on chromosome 6 like other TCP1-related proteins implied to
Sevigny et al. (1994) that the genes coding the TCP1-related proteins
present in the TCP1 ring complex are probably not organized in a cluster
and thus are not synchronously regulated by a cis-acting control region
such as the LCR involved in the regulation of globin synthesis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) showed that the mouse genome contains 1 Tric5 gene
and 1 Tric5 pseudogene located on chromosomes 3F and 5B, respectively.

606389	TITLE *606389 CATION CHANNEL, SPERM-ASSOCIATED, 1; CATSPER1
;;CATSPER
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CATSPER is a sperm-specific ion channel that mediates calcium entry into
sperm and is essential for sperm hyperactivated motility and male
fertility. The CASTPER complex contains 4 pore-forming subunits,
CATSPER1, CATSPER2 (607249), CATSPER3 (609120), and CATSPER4 (609121),
and at least 2 auxiliary proteins, CATSPERB (611169) and CATSPERG
(613452). Each pore-forming subunit has 6 transmembrane-spanning domains
and an intracellular C-terminal coiled-coil domain. In addition,
CATSPER1 has an intracellular N-terminal histidine-rich region. Both the
pore-forming subunits and the auxiliary subunits of CATSPER localize to
the sperm principal piece (review by Ren and Xia, 2010).

CLONING

While searching for calcium channels, Ren et al. (2001) identified an
EST cDNA expressed only in testis. They cloned the corresponding
full-length cDNA from human and mouse testis by PCR and library
screening. The CATSPER gene encodes a protein of 686 amino acids that is
expressed exclusively in testis. The amino acid sequence of CATSPER most
closely resembles a single 6-transmembrane-spanning repeat of the
voltage-dependent calcium channel 4-repeat structure. Human CATSPER
exhibits a high degree of homology (55% identity) with its mouse
counterpart, especially in the transmembrane domains and histidine-rich
region. The transmembrane domains share 81% identity and the pore
regions 89% identity. Using immunofluorescence, Ren et al. (2001)
detected the expression of CATSPER within the principal piece of the
sperm tail.

GENE FUNCTION

Kirichok et al. (2006) used a simple approach to patch-clamp spermatozoa
and to characterize whole-spermatozoan currents and identified a
constitutively active flagellar calcium channel that is strongly
potentiated by intracellular alkalinization. This current is not present
in spermatozoa lacking the sperm-specific putative ion channel protein
Catsper1. This plasma membrane protein of the 6 transmembrane-spanning
ion channel superfamily is specifically localized to the principal piece
of the sperm tail and is required for sperm cell hyperactivation and
male fertility (Ren et al., 2001; Carlson et al., 2003). Kirichok et al.
(2006) concluded that their results identified Catsper1 as a component
of the key flagellar calcium channel, and suggested that intracellular
alkalinization potentiates Catsper current to increase intraflagellar
calcium and induce sperm hyperactivation.

Strunker et al. (2011) demonstrated that progesterone activates the
sperm-specific, pH-sensitive CatSper calcium ion channel. They found
that both progesterone and alkaline pH stimulate a rapid calcium ion
influx with almost no latency, incompatible with a signaling pathway
involving metabotrophic receptors and second messengers. The calcium ion
signals evoked by alkaline pH and progesterone were inhibited by 2 Ca(V)
channel blockers. Patch-clamp recordings from sperm revealed an
alkaline-activated current carried by mono- and divalent ions that
exhibited all the hallmarks of sperm-specific CatSper calcium ion
channels. Progesterone substantially enhanced the CatSper current. The
alkaline- and progesterone-activated CatSper current was inhibited by
both Ca(V) channel blockers. Strunker et al. (2011) concluded that their
results resolved a long-standing controversy over the nongenomic
progesterone signaling. In human sperm, either the CatSper channel
itself or an associated protein serves as the nongenomic progesterone
receptor.

Lishko et al. (2011) elucidated the mechanism of the nongenomic action
of progesterone on human spermatozoa by identifying the calcium ion
channel activated by progesterone. By applying the patch-clamp technique
to mature human spermatozoa, Lishko et al. (2011) found that nanomolar
concentrations of progesterone dramatically potentiate CatSper, a
pH-dependent calcium ion channel of the sperm flagellum. Lishko et al.
(2011) demonstrated that human CatSper is synergistically activated by
elevation of intracellular pH and extracellular progesterone.
Interestingly, human CatSper can be further potentiated by
prostaglandins, but apparently through a binding site other than that of
progesterone. Because their experimental conditions did not support
second messenger signaling, CatSper or a directly associated protein may
serve as the elusive nongenomic progesterone receptor of sperm. Given
that the CatSper-associated progesterone receptor is sperm-specific and
structurally different from the genomic progesterone receptor (607311),
it represents a promising target for the development of a new class of
nonhormonal contraceptives.

GENE STRUCTURE

Avenarius et al. (2009) noted that the CATSPER1 gene comprises 12 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Avenarius et al. (2009) identified the CATSPER1 gene on chromosome
11q13.1 by genomic sequence analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 infertile males with spermatogenic failure-7 (612997) from 2
consanguineous Iranian families, Avenarius et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for 1 of 2 separate insertion mutations in the CATSPER1
gene. CATSPER1 is one of 4 members of the sperm-specific CATSPER
voltage-gated calcium channel family shown to be essential for normal
male fertility in mice. The results suggested that CATSPER1 is also
essential for normal male fertility in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study its function in vivo, Ren et al. (2001) disrupted mouse Catsper
in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination. Catsper
homozygous-deficient mice were born at expected mendelian ratios and
were indistinguishable from wildtype littermates in survival rates,
appearance, and gross behavior. Homozygous-deficient females mated with
heterozygous-deficient or wildtype males were fertile. Homozygous male
mutants mated with wildtype females displayed mounting behavior
indistinguishable from that of wildtype males but were completely
infertile. Body and testis weights of the mutant mice were not different
from those of wildtype counterparts; sperm counts were not significantly
different, and sperm appeared morphologically similar. However, Catsper
-/- sperm were sluggish and displayed less directed movements. Further
investigation indicated that Catsper is required to penetrate the egg.
Catsper -/- sperm incubated with zona pellucida-free eggs were able to
fertilize the eggs, indicating that Catsper is not required for egg
activation. Ren et al. (2001) demonstrated that Catsper is required for
cAMP-induced calcium influx.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPERMATOGENIC FAILURE 7
CATSPER1, 1-BP INS, 539T

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Iranian family with nonsyndromic
male infertility (SPGF7; 612997), Avenarius et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for insertion of a thymine at nucleotide 539 in exon 1 of
the CATSPER1 gene. This insertion was predicted to introduce 8 novel
amino acids followed by a premature termination codon into the CATSPER1
protein (lys180lysfsX8). If the aberrant transcript is not subject to
nonsense-mediated decay, a severely truncated 188-amino acid protein
would be translated. This mutation was not identified in 576 Iranian
control individuals.

.0002
SPERMATOGENIC FAILURE 7
CATSPER1, 5-BP INS, 948ATGGC

In a male from a consanguineous Iranian family with nonsyndromic
infertility (612997), Avenarius et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 5-bp insertion after nucleotide 948 in exon 1 of the CATSPER1
gene. The frameshift caused by this insertion was predicted to
substitute a methionine at asp317 and introduce 18 novel residues before
a premature stop codon (asp317metfsX18). In the absence of
nonsense-mediated decay, the predicted product would be a truncated
335-residue protein. This mutation was also found in homozygosity in one
female family member. This mutation was not identified in 576 Iranian
control individuals.

602106	TITLE *602106 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, INWARDLY RECTIFYING, SUBFAMILY J, MEMBER 15; KCNJ15
;;KIR4.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The potassium channel inward rectifiers (Kir) constitute a family of
potassium channels that maintain the resting membrane potential close to
the equilibrium potential for potassium ions.

CLONING

By isolating, mapping, and sequencing trapped exons and captured cDNAs
from cosmids of the Down syndrome (190685) chromosome region (DSCR) on
21q22.2, Gosset et al. (1997) discovered a gene, designated KCNJ15,
encoding a member of the Kir family. The deduced protein contains 375
amino acids. Gosset et al. (1997) found that KCNJ15 is expressed in
kidney and lung during human development and in several adult tissues
including kidney and brain.

Okamoto et al. (2010) stated that expression of KCNJ15 in the pancreas
is relatively high, as is that in the kidney, thymus, and whole blood.
Immunofluorescence staining of tissue from nondiabetic patients revealed
that expression of KCNJ15 in Langerhans islets of the pancreas was
prominent compared to that of the exocrine glands.

MAPPING

Gosset et al. (1997) identified the KCNJ15 gene within the Down syndrome
chromosome region on 21q22.2. Another inwardly rectifying potassium
channel gene, that encoding Kir3.2 (KCNJ6; 600877), had been mapped
within the DSCR.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Okamoto et al. (2010) identified a synonymous SNP in exon 4 of the
KCNJ15 gene (dbSNP rs3746876, C566T) that showed significant association
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 125853) affecting lean individuals
in 3 independent Japanese sample sets (p = 2.5 x 10(-7); odds ratio,
2.54) and with unstratified T2DM (p = 6.7 x 10(-6); OR, 1.76). The
diabetes risk allele frequency was, however, very low among Europeans
and no association between the variant and T2DM could be shown in a
Danish case-control study. Functional analysis in HEK293 cells
demonstrated that the risk T allele increased KCNJ15 expression via
increased mRNA stability, which resulted in higher expression of protein
compared to the C allele.

611347	TITLE *611347 INTEGRATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 3; INTS3
;;INT3;;
SENSOR OF SINGLE-STRANDED DNA COMPLEX, SUBUNIT A,; SOSSA;;
SOSS COMPLEX, SUBUNIT A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INTS3 is a subunit of the Integrator complex, which associates with the
C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II large subunit (POLR2A; 180660)
and mediates 3-prime end processing of small nuclear RNAs U1 (RNU1;
180680) and U2 (RNU2; 180690) (Baillat et al., 2005). INTS3 is also a
subunit of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding complexes involved in the
maintenance of genome stability (Huang et al., 2009).

GENE FUNCTION

By SDS-PAGE of proteins that copurified with INTS11 (CPSF3L; 611354) in
HEK293 cells, Baillat et al. (2005) identified INTS3 as a subunit of the
Integrator complex.

Using HEK293 cells for tandem affinity purification, Huang et al. (2009)
identified INTS3, which they called SOSSA, and SOSSC (613273) as common
components of 2 distinct and complementary ssDNA-binding heterotrimeric
complexes defined by their inclusion of either SOSSB1 (SSBP1; 600439) or
SOSSB2 (SSBP2; 607389), but not both. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
confirmed that SOSS complexes formed in HeLa cells independent of DNA
damage. Recombinant heterotrimeric SOSS complexes specifically bound
ssDNA, but not double-stranded DNA. SOSSA served as the central assembly
factor, and SOSSB and SOSSC bound overlapping regions on SOSSA, but they
did not interact directly with each other. Depletion of SOSSA by small
interfering RNA led to dramatic decreases in SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 protein
levels, abrogated targeting of SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 to chromatin, increased
ionizing radiation sensitivity, caused defective G2/M checkpoint, and
impaired homologous recombination repair. Huang et al. (2009)
demonstrated that both SOSS complexes and the CTIP (RBBP8; 604124)/RPA
(see RPA1; 179835) complex acted downstream of the MRE11 (600814)-RAD50
(604040)-NBS1 (NBN; 602667) complex and functioned in DNA damage repair.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the INTS3
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP WI-15199).

104700	TITLE *104700 AMYLASE, SALIVARY, A; AMY1A
;;AMYLASE, SALIVARY; AMY1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The alpha-amylases hydrolyze alpha-1,4-glucoside bonds in polymers of
glucose units. Kamaryt and Laxova (1965, 1966) found 2 amylase
isoenzymes in serum, one produced by the salivary gland and the second
by the pancreas (see 104650). In 11 of 120 children, a duplication of
pancreatic enzyme band was found on starch gel electrophoresis and in
each case 1 parent also showed the duplication. In the mouse the
salivary and pancreatic amylases are determined by genes at closely
linked loci (Sick and Nielsen, 1964). The separate loci in the human
were designated AMY1 (salivary) and AMY2 (pancreatic). Polymorphism of
both the salivary and the pancreatic serum amylases has been
demonstrated in man. Ward et al. (1971) studied amylase in saliva and
identified electrophoretic variants. Data on gene frequencies of allelic
variants were tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishide et al. (1986) showed that the human salivary alpha-amylase gene
is about 10 kb long and has 10 introns.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization combined with high resolution cytogenetics,
Zabel et al. (1983) assigned the amylase gene to 1p21, the POMC gene
(176830) to 2p23, and the somatostatin gene (182450) to 3q28.

Using amylase DNA probes in somatic cell hybrids, Tricoli and Shows
(1984) mapped the amylase genes to the 1p22.1-p21 region.

Multipoint linkage analysis showed that the amylase gene cluster is
located distal to NGFB (162030) (Dracopoli and Meisler, 1990).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pronk et al. (1982) presented evidence they interpreted as indicating
duplication of the salivary amylase locus.

Gumucio et al. (1988) isolated cosmid clones containing 250 kb of
genomic DNA from the human amylase gene cluster. These clones were found
to contain 7 distinct amylase genes: 2 pancreatic amylase genes, 3
salivary amylase genes, and 2 truncated pseudogenes. Intergenic
distances of 17 to 22 kb separated the amylase gene copies.

Dracopoli and Meisler (1990) used a (CA)n repeat sequence immediately
upstream from the gamma-actin pseudogene associated with the AMY2B gene
(104660) in a study of 40 CEPH families. By PCR amplification of genomic
DNA, they identified 6 alleles with (CA)n lengths of 16 to 21 repeats.
The average heterozygosity was 0.70.

Large-scale copy number variations (LCVs) involve gains or losses of
several kilobases to hundreds of kilobases of genomic DNA among
phenotypically normal individuals. To investigate LCVs in the human
genome, Iafrate et al. (2004) applied array-based comparative genomic
hybridization (array CGH) to the genomes of 55 unrelated individuals.
The most common LCV (identified in 49.1% of the individuals studied)
encompassed the AMY1A and AMY2A locus (Groot et al., 1991). Iafrate et
al. (2004) detected relative gains (in 23.6% of cases) and losses (in
25.5% of cases) at this locus and confirmed the array CGH results using
metaphase-interphase FISH, high-resolution fiber FISH, and quantitative
PCR. In all they described more than 200 LCVs in the human genome.
Twenty-four of these variants were present in more than 10% of the
individuals studied, and 6 of these variants were present at a frequency
of more than 20%. A chromosome map indicating the location of the LCVs
was provided. Carter (2004) commented on this work and the parallel work
of Sebat et al. (2004).

Starch consumption is a prominent characteristic of agricultural
societies and hunter-gatherers in arid environments. In contrast,
rainforest and circum-arctic hunter-gatherers and some pastoralists
consume much less starch. This behavioral variation raised the
possibility that different selective pressures have acted on amylase,
the enzyme responsible for starch hydrolysis. Perry et al. (2007) found
that copy number of the AMY1 gene is correlated positively with salivary
amylase protein level and that individuals from populations with high
starch diets have, on average, more AMY1 copies than those with
traditionally low starch diets. Comparisons with other loci in a subset
of these populations suggested that the extent of AMY1 copy number
differentiation is highly unusual. Higher AMY1 copy numbers and protein
levels probably improve the digestion of starchy foods and may buffer
against the fitness-reducing effects of intestinal disease.

EVOLUTION

Groot et al. (1990) presented structural analyses of the human amylase
gene cluster that allowed them to construct a model for the evolution of
this family of genes by a number of consecutive events involving inter-
and intrachromosomal crossovers.

In a study comparing human AMY1 copy number variation with that of
chimpanzees and bonobos, Perry et al. (2007) found that the average
human has 3 times more AMY1 copies than chimpanzees, and bonobos may not
have salivary amylase at all. Outgroup comparisons with other great apes
suggested that AMY1 copy number was probably gained in the human
lineage, rather than lost in chimpanzees. It is hypothesized that
starch-rich plant underground storage organs (USOs) such as bulbs,
corms, and tubers were a critical food resource for early hominins. The
example of amylase as representative of the importance of diet as a
widespread source of selective pressure in human evolution is comparable

600020	TITLE *600020 MAX-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; MXI1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MAD (600021) and MXI1 genes encode basic helix-loop-helix leucine
zipper transcription factors that bind MAX (154950) in vitro, forming a
sequence-specific DNA-binding complex similar to the MYC-MAX
heterodimer. MXI1 and MAD may antagonize MYC function and are candidate
tumor suppressor genes (Edelhoff et al., 1994).

CLONING

Zervos et al. (1993) isolated the MXI1 as a protein that specifically
interacts with MAX. The MXI1 protein contains a bHLH-ZIP motif that is
similar to that found in Myc family proteins. MXI1 interacts
specifically with MAX to form heterodimers that efficiently bind to the
Myc-MAX consensus recognition site. When bound to DNA by a LexA moiety
in yeast, MXI1 does not stimulate transcription.

Albarosa et al. (1995) concluded that the coding sequence of MXI1 has an
open reading frame that is 28 codons shorter at the 3-prime end than
previously described.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wechsler et al. (1996) showed that MXI1 contains 6 exons and spans
approximately 60 kb.

MAPPING

Edelhoff et al. (1994) mapped the MXI1 gene to human chromosome 10q25
and to mouse chromosome 19 at region D by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). A second site of hybridization on mouse chromosome
2 at region C was thought to represent either a pseudogene or a related
sequence. By FISH, Wechsler et al. (1994) mapped the MXI1 gene to
10q24-q25. Shapiro et al. (1994) confirmed the assignments of the MAD
and MXI1 genes to chromosomes 2p13-p12 and 10q24-q25, respectively, by
somatic cell mapping and FISH.

In the mouse, Steingrimsson et al. (1995) mapped the Mxi1 gene, as well
as those for 4 other bHLH-ZIP transcription factors, by interspecific
backcross analysis. An Mxi1 gene was found to reside on mouse chromosome
19 in an area known to have homology of synteny to human 10q.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Albarosa et al. (1995) found an AAAAC polymorphic repeat in the 3-prime
noncoding region of the gene. Using this polymorphism, they demonstrated
loss of heterozygosity in all of 9 glioblastomas and in none of 6
anaplastic astrocytomas. Glioblastoma multiforme (137800) demonstrates
chromosome 10 changes in a majority of instances.

Since the MXI1 protein negatively regulates MYC oncoprotein activity, it
potentially serves a tumor suppressor function. MXI1 maps to a region of
chromosome 10 that is deleted in some cases of prostate cancer (176807).
This prompted Eagle et al. (1995) to do studies in which they
demonstrated mutations in the retained MXI1 allele in 4 primary prostate
tumors with 10q24-q25 deletions. Two tumors contained inactivating
mutations, whereas 2 others contained the identical missense mutation.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization also demonstrated loss of one MXI1
allele in an additional tumor lacking chromosome 10 abnormalities. MXI1
thus displays allelic loss and mutation in some cases of prostate cancer
that may contribute to the pathogenesis or neoplastic evolution of this
common malignancy. These findings satisfy the Knudson 2-hit hypothesis.

One of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in prostate cancer
involves loss of 10q22-qter. Rarely, a smaller deletion, involving
10q24-q25 has been observed, suggesting the presence of a tumor
suppressor gene at that site. Prochownik et al. (1998) prospectively
evaluated prostate tumors for loss of MXI1 by FISH and cytogenetic
techniques. Of 40 tumors, 21 (53%) demonstrated loss of a single MXI1
allele, as determined by FISH. In 10 cases with cytogenetically normal
long arms of chromosome 10, but with FISH-documented deletion of MXI1, 8
mutations of MXI1 were identified. Five of the mutant proteins were
incapable of binding DNA in association with MAX. Prochownik et al.
(1998) concluded that MXI1 gene loss in prostate cancer is common and
most frequently involves a cytogenetically undetectable deletion.

MXI1 appears to regulate MYC function negatively and therefore is a
potential tumor suppressor gene. Li et al. (1999) screened for MXI1
mutations in solid tumors, including 4 neurofibrosarcomas, and also
examined 29 human tumor cell lines. They discovered a missense mutation,
GCA to GTA (ala54 to val; 600020.0004), in exon 2 in a neurofibrosarcoma
patient; they found 2 different missense mutations in a second
neurofibrosarcoma patient, and 3 amino acid substitutions in a third. In
the last patient, loss of heterozygosity was also demonstrated.
Neurofibrosarcoma is known to develop in patients with neurofibromatosis
type I (NF1; 162200). Li et al. (1999) suggested that MXI1 mutations may
play a role in the pathogenesis of neurofibrosarcoma in NF1; the second
case of 2 mutations in exon 5 occurred in a patient who also had NF1.

ANIMAL MODEL

MXI1 belongs to the family of proteins that function as potent
antagonists of MYC oncoproteins. This antagonism relates to their
ability to compete with MYC for the protein MAX and for consensus DNA
binding sites and to recruit Sin3 proteins (see SIN3A; 607776) and their
associated corepressors. Schreiber-Agus et al. (1998) disrupted the Mxi1
open reading frame in transgenic mice by eliminating an exon required
for the production of the 2 mouse Mxi1 isoforms. They showed that the
mice lacking Mxi1 exhibit progressive multisystem abnormalities. The
mice also showed increased susceptibility to tumorigenesis either
following carcinogen treatment or when also deficient in INK4A (600160).
This cancer-prone phenotype may correspond with the enhanced ability of
several MXI1-deficient cell types, including prostatic epithelium, to
proliferate. The results show that MXI1 is involved in the homeostasis
of differentiated organ systems, acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo, and
engages the MYC network in a functionally relevant manner. In histologic
studies of the mice, Schreiber-Agus et al. (1998) focused particularly
on organs that normally express high or sustained levels of Mxi1, e.g.,
brain, spleen, kidney, and liver, and on tissue types that are
susceptible to tumorigenesis when a putative tumor suppressor is lost
from the 10q24-q26 region; for example, the spleen and thymus are
susceptible to T-cell leukemia, the prostatic epithelium to prostate
cancer, and the brain to glioblastoma multiforme when the 10q24-q26
region is mutated.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PROSTATE CANCER
MXI1, 1-BP DEL, A, CODON 140 OR 141

In a prostate cancer (176807) tumor, Eagle et al. (1995) found loss of a
single alanine at codon 140 or 141, converting AAG (lys) to AGT (ser) in
the ZIP-encoding exon. The frameshift resulted in loss of the terminal
leucine residue of the ZIP domain as well as loss of all additional
downstream amino acid sequences, including those comprising the last 2
alpha-helical turns of the ZIP domain. This was a presumably
inactivating mutation.

.0002
PROSTATE CANCER
MXI1, SPLICE DONOR SITE, GT-GC

In a prostate cancer (176807) tumor, Eagle et al. (1995) observed a
T-to-C transition in the invariant GT dinucleotide of the splice donor
site of the ZIP-encoding exon.

.0003
PROSTATE CANCER
MXI1, GLU152ALA

In prostate cancer (176807) tumors from 2 different patients, Eagle et
al. (1995) found the same mutation, an A-to-C transversion in the second
nucleotide of codon 152 resulting in the nonconservative substitution of
alanine (GCG) for glutamic acid (GAG).

.0004
NEUROFIBROSARCOMA
MXI1, ALA54VAL

Li et al. (1999) identified MXI1 mutations in 3 of 4 neurofibrosarcoma
patients. One of the mutations was a change from GCA to GTA (ala54 to
val) in exon 2. Neurofibrosarcoma is known to develop in patients with
neurofibromatosis type I (162200).

607222	TITLE *607222 F-BOX ONLY PROTEIN 18; FBXO18
;;F-BOX DNA HELICASE 1; FBH1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA helicases are enzymes involved in DNA replication, repair, and
recombination. They generate single-stranded DNA by catalyzing the
melting of stable helical DNA structures utilizing energy derived from
the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates. FBH1 is a member of a unique
class of DNA helicases that are also involved in cell cycle regulation
by catalyzing ubiquitin ligation of proteins for ubiquitin-mediated
proteolysis (Kim et al., 2002).

CLONING

Kim et al. (2002) cloned FBH1 by searching for homologs of S. pombe DNA
helicase I, screening a HeLa cell cDNA library, and 5-prime RACE. The
deduced 969-amino acid protein contains an F-box motif and 7 conserved
helicase motifs. It shares 95% identity with the mouse protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (2002) found that recombinant FBH1, purified from
baculovirus-infected sf9 cells, showed elevated levels of
single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity. They determined that FBH1
translocates in the 3-prime-to-5-prime direction and is not dependent on
fork structures for its unwinding activity. The presence of an F-box in
the FBH1 sequence suggested its inclusion in SCF (SKP1 (601434)/cullin
(see CUL1; 603134)/F-box) complexes, which are involved in
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with
extracts of cotransfected human 293T cells confirmed that FBH1 interacts
with SKP1 and, through SKP1, with CUL1 and ROC1 (RBX1; 603814) in vitro.
All interactions were dependent on a functional F-box motif. The SCF
complex including FBH1 displayed ubiquitin ligase activity.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO18 gene maps to chromosome 10p15.1
and the mouse Fbxo18 gene maps to chromosome 2A1.

;;PROTEASOME COMPONENT 5; PSC5;;
PROTEASOME SUBUNIT ZETA
DESCRIPTION See 176842.

DeMartino et al. (1991) cloned the PSMA5 gene, termed 'subunit zeta' by
them. The cDNA encoded a 241-amino acid polypeptide. The calculated and
observed molecular masses were 26 kD and 29 kD, respectively. Northern
blot analysis revealed an mRNA of 1.2 kb in both human placenta and HeLa
cells.

Coux et al. (1996) reviewed the structures and functions of the 20S
proteasome subunits. The alpha subunits comprise the outer rings of the
proteasome. Some alpha subunits contain a functional nuclear
localization signal; proteasomes are found in both the nuclear and
cytoplasmic compartments of the cell. Alpha subunits may constitute a
physical barrier that limits access of cytosolic proteins into the inner
proteolytic chamber.

To determine whether the order in a cluster of genes that had been
mapped to chromosome 1q in the Chinese hamster by a coamplification
mapping technique is conserved in the human genome, Mayau et al. (1998)
screened the YAC library from the CEPH laboratory by PCR. They found
that, as in the hamster, the PSMA5 gene was close to GNAI3 (139370),
which is located at 1p13.

;;KIAA0652;;
PARAPROTEIN TARGET 8; PARATARG8;;
PARATARG 8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Macroautophagy is a catabolic process for lysosome-mediated degradation
of cytoplasmic proteins, organelles, and macromolecules. ATG proteins,
such as ATG13, are required for formation of autophagosomes,
double-membrane vesicles that surround and sequester cytoplasmic cargo
prior to fusion with lysosomes (Mercer et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned ATG13, which they designated
KIAA0652. The deduced protein contains 517 amino acids. RT-PCR detected
high ATG13 expression in all 10 human tissues examined. SDS-PAGE
detected in vitro-translated ATG13 at an apparent molecular mass of 67
kD.

By searching databases for orthologs of yeast Atg13, Mercer et al.
(2009) identified human ATG13. The deduced protein contains 480 amino
acids. Database analysis showed that ATG13 is conserved from mammals to
lower eukaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein interaction assays, Mercer et al. (2009) found that ATG13
interacted with ATG101 (615089) and with the macroautophagy proteins
ULK1 (603168) and FIP200 (RB1CC1; 606837). Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that ATG13, ATG101, ULK1, and FIP200 formed a complex that
redistributed to punctate structures following starvation-induced
autophagy in HEK293 cells. Knockdown of ATG13 or ATG101 in starved
HEK293 cells reduced accumulation of a lipid-modified form of LC3B
(MAP1LC3B; 609604) that associates with autophagosomes. ATG13 was
required for ATG101 stabilization and localization in the autophagy
complex. ATG13 and ATG101 were required for formation of autophagosomes,
but not for downstream vesicle trafficking or fusion with lysosomes.
Incorporation of radiolabeled PO4 and phosphatase treatment showed that
ATG13 is phosphoprotein, but phosphorylation status of ATG13 had no
effect on the function of the autophagy complex or on ATG101 stability.

Using gel filtration and Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysates,
Hosokawa et al. (2009) independently identified ATG101 as part of an
approximately 3-MDa autophagy complex including ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200.
ATG101 was also detected in complex with ATG13 only and as a monomer.
The distribution of ATG101 in the 3 fractions was unaltered by
starvation in HeLa cells. Use of small interfering RNA revealed that
ATG13 mediated interaction between ATG101 and ULK1 and that ATG101 was
required for the stability and basal phosphorylation of ATG13 and ULK1.
Knockdown of ATG101 inhibited formation of LC3-containing autophagosome
puncta.

Chan et al. (2009) found that human ATG13 interacted with mouse Ulk1 and
Ulk2 (608650), both of which phosphorylated ATG13.

Antigenic targets of paraproteins, or paratargs, may play a role in the
pathogenesis of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (see
153600), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (see 153600), and multiple
myeloma (254500). Preuss et al. (2011) noted that all autoantigenic
paratargs, including ATG13, which they called paratarg-8, are
hyperphosphorylated in patients compared with healthy controls,
suggesting a general pathogenic mechanism. Using coimmunoprecipitation
analysis, Preuss et al. (2011) identified phosphokinase C (PKC)-zeta
(PRKCZ; 176982) as the kinase responsible for hyperphosphorylation of
paratarg-8 and most other autoantigenic paratargs tested. They
identified phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) as the phosphatase
responsible for dephosphorylation of all hyperphosphorylated
autoantigenic paratargs tested. Studies of carriers of
hyperphosphorylated and wildtype paratarg-7 (STOML2; 608292) suggested
that inactivation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PPP2CA; 176915) via
tyr307 phosphorylation causes hyperphosphorylation of autoantigenic
paratargs.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ATG13
gene to chromosome 11.

Hartz (2013) mapped the ATG13 gene to chromosome 11p11.2 based on an
alignment of the ATG13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB014552) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608277	TITLE *608277 CARBOHYDRATE SULFOTRANSFERASE 15; CHST15
;;B-CELL RAG-ASSOCIATED GENE; BRAG;;
N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINE 4-SULFATE 6-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE;;
GalNAc4S-6ST;;
KIAA0598
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned KIAA0598. The 3-prime untranslated
region of the transcript contains an Alu repeat. The deduced 561-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 72 kD. RT-PCR
detected high expression in all tissues examined.

By differential display of genes coexpressed with RAG1 (179615),
followed by screening a pre-B-cell cDNA library, Verkoczy et al. (1998)
cloned BRAG. The deduced protein contains 503 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 55 kD. In vitro translation resulted in a
doublet that migrated between 69 and 49 kD by SDS-PAGE. BRAG is a type
II transmembrane glycoprotein with an 81-amino acid cytoplasmic N
terminus, followed by a transmembrane domain, and a 405-amino acid
extracellular C terminus. The N terminus contains a putative
palmitoylation site and several phosphorylation sites, and the C
terminus contains 4 putative N-glycosylation sites. Verkoczy et al.
(1998) also identified a putative splice variant that contains an
in-frame 12-bp deletion. Northern blot analysis detected a 5.0-kb BRAG
transcript expressed in all B-cell lines that also expressed RAG1.
Little or no expression was detected in several nonlymphoid cell lines,
and no expression was detected in T-cell lines, irrespective of RAG1
expression. Northern blot analysis of whole tissues detected expression
in bone marrow and tonsil, but not in heart, thymus, or placenta. RNA
dot blot analysis detected high levels in fetal and adult spleen,
peripheral blood leukocytes, and lymph node, moderate levels in heart,
ovary, stomach, and brain putamen, and low levels in bone marrow and
several other tissues. Zoo blot analysis performed under low stringency
conditions indicated that the BRAG gene is conserved across eukaryotes.
High stringency conditions revealed predominant bands only in human and
baboon DNA.

Verkoczy et al. (2000) determined that BRAG is a membrane-integrated
glycoprotein that is expressed as a disulfide-linked dimer in B cells.
They found glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of BRAG, with apparent
molecular masses of about 63 and 52 kD, respectively, in the
intracellular fraction of tonsillar B cells and in transfected
erythroleukemia cells; only the glycosylated product associated with the
cell surface.

Ohtake et al. (2001) determined that the KIAA0589 protein (Nagase et
al., 1998) shares significant similarity with GalNAc4S-6ST purified from
squid cartilage. They also noted that the nucleotide sequence of
KIAA0598 is nearly identical to that of BRAG (Verkoczy et al., 1998),
but the deduced proteins are significantly different. However, the
KIAA0598 and BRAG proteins are both type II transmembrane proteins, and
both contain a 3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate
(PAPS)-binding domain characteristic of most sulfotransferases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yuki et al. (2000) determined that the BRAG gene contains 7 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Verkoczy et al. (1998) showed that BRAG induced RAG1 expression
following transfection into a B-cell line, but not following
transfection into a nonlymphoid cell line.

Verkoczy et al. (2000) found that BRAG associated with phosphorylated
proteins in unstimulated mature B cells, but not in B cells activated
through B-cell receptor cross-linking. They presented evidence that BRAG
functions as a cell surface receptor capable of cell signaling.

Ohtake et al. (2001) characterized the enzymatic activity of KIAA0598,
which they designated GalNAc4S-6ST, following transfection into COS-7
cells and confirmed that it displays sulfotransferase activity. They
found that GalNAc4S-6ST catalyzed the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to
position 6 of the nonreducing terminal and internal N-acetylgalatosamine
4-sulfate residues in chondroitin sulfate A and dermatan sulfate. Only
nonreducing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues were
sulfated when a trisaccharide and a pentasaccharide with sulfated groups
at position 4 of N-acetylgalactosamine residues were used as acceptors.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the KIAA0598
gene to chromosome 10.

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Verkoczy et al. (1998) mapped
the CHST15 gene to chromosome 10q26. Using Southern blot analysis, they
determined that CHST15 is a single-copy gene that is not likely to be a
member of a multigene family.

609211	TITLE *609211 MYOSIN, LIGHT CHAIN 12B, REGULATORY; MYL12B
;;MYOSIN REGULATORY LIGHT CHAIN 2; MRLC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The activity of nonmuscle myosin II (see MYH9; 160775) is regulated by
phosphorylation of a regulatory light chain, such as MRLC2. This
phosphorylation results in higher MgATPase activity and the assembly of
myosin II filaments (Iwasaki et al., 2001).

CLONING

Grant et al. (1990) cloned MRLC2 from a placenta cDNA library. The
deduced protein contains 171 amino acids.

Using primers designed from chicken Mrlc, Iwasaki et al. (2001)
amplified MRLC2 from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The deduced 172-amino
acid protein contains thr18 and ser19, which are conserved
phosphorylation sites in myosin regulatory light chains.

GENE FUNCTION

Diphosphorylation of MRLCs on thr18 and ser19 results in higher MgATPase
activity and myosin filament formation than monophosphorylation at ser19
in vitro. By site-directed mutagenesis, Iwasaki et al. (2001) created
MRLC2 mutants that mimicked diphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and
unphosphorylated forms of MRLC2. Overexpression of the diphosphorylated
form, and to a lesser degree the monophosphorylated form, caused the
formation of a large number of actin filament bundles in transfected
HeLa cells. Overexpression of the unphosphorylated form caused a
decrease in the number of actin filament bundles. Immunolocalization of
the mutant proteins in dividing cells revealed colocalization of the 2
phosphorylated forms with actin filaments in the peripheral region and
with the contractile ring, while the unphosphorylated form localized
diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. Iwasaki et al. (2001) concluded that
phosphorylation of MRLC2 is required for organization of stress fibers
in interphase cells and the contractile ring in dividing cells. They
suggested that diphosphorylated MRLC may be more effective in organizing
actin filaments than monophosphorylated MRLC.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MYL12B
gene to chromosome 18 (TMAP SHGC-12353).

602116	TITLE *602116 YEATS DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; YEATS4
;;GLIOMA-AMPLIFIED SEQUENCE 41; GAS41
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gene amplification, which is generally considered to occur late in tumor
development, is a common feature of high-grade glioma. Fischer et al.
(1997) reported cloning and sequencing a cDNA, termed GAS41 by them,
that was identified in a glioblastoma cell line by
microdissection-mediated cDNA capture (Gracia et al., 1996). An
increased copy number of GAS41 was found in glioblastoma multiforme and
astrocytoma III, and at a high frequency in astrocytoma grades I and II.
Sequence comparison indicated high similarity between the GAS41 protein,
yeast and human AF9 (159558), and human ENL (159556). Fischer et al.
(1997) noted that both AF9 and ENL belong to a class of transcription
factors, indicating that GAS41 may also represent a transcription
factor. With GAS41 being the first gene found with increased copy number
in low-grade glioma, this study provided the first evidence that gene
amplification can occur in early tumor development.

GENE FUNCTION

The NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex is responsible for
acetylation of the N-terminal tails of histone H4 (see 602822) and H2A
(see 613499) in yeast. Its catalytic subunit, Esa1, is homologous to
human TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409). Using affinity purification, Western blot
analysis, cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and mass
spectrometry, Doyon et al. (2004) found that TIP60 and its splice
variant, TIP60B/PLIP, were part of a multisubunit NuA4 complex with HAT
activity in several human cell lines. They identified human homologs for
11 of the 12 yeast NuA4 subunits, including GAS41.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of human 293T cells, Park and Roeder
(2006) found that GAS41 associated with TIP60 complex core subunits and
with H2AZ (H2AFZ; 142763), a component of the SWI2/SNF2 (SMARCA2;
600014)-related CBP (CREBBP; 600140) activator protein (SRCAP) complex,
confirming that GAS41 is a genuine subunit of the TIP60 and SRCAP
complexes. TIP60 complexes containing GAS41 showed typical
TIP60-mediated H3 and H4 acetyltransferase activity on free core
histones. Either knockdown of GAS41 expression with small interfering
RNA or specific interruptions of the C-terminal coiled-coil motif of the
GAS41 protein activated the p53 (TP53; 191170) tumor suppressor pathway.
Activation of the p53 pathway did not result from changes in TIP60
complex assembly or TIP60 coactivator functions for p53. GAS41 was
prebound to the promoters of 2 p53 tumor suppressor pathway genes, p21
(CDKN1A; 116899) and p14(ARF) (CDKN2A; 600160), in normal unstressed
cells, but GAS41 dissociated from both promoters in response to
p53-activating stress signals.

Using RNA interference in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Fazzio et al.
(2008) found that depletion of any of 7 components of the Tip60-p400
(EP400; 606265) HAT and nucleosome remodeling complex, including Yeats4,
caused the same phenotype. Unlike normal ES cells, which grow in
spherical 3-dimensional colonies, ES cells depleted of any the 7
Tip60-p400 HAT components showed a flattened and elongated morphology,
with monolayer growth and reduced cell-cell contacts. These knockdown
cells continued to cycle, with reduced cells in S phase and increased
cells in G2 phase. The effect of Tip60-p400 HAT component knockdown was
unique to ES cells, as negligible changes were observed following
knockdown in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Lauffart et al.
(2002) showed that TAAC1 (605301) interacted with the C-terminal 109
amino acids of GAS41.

Zimmermann et al. (2002) found that targeted disruption of both Gas41
alleles in a chicken prelymphoid cell line resulted in a significant
decrease in RNA synthesis and subsequent cell death, indicating that
GAS41 is required for RNA transcription.

Braas et al. (2004) found that the chicken Gas41 promoter contains
several potential Myb (189990)-binding sites, and they demonstrated that
Gas41 is a v-Myb target gene.

MAPPING

The GAS41 gene maps to chromosome 12q13-q15 (Gracia et al., 1996).

612157	TITLE *612157 SENTRIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE FAMILY, MEMBER 1; SENP1
SENP1/MESDC2 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The covalent modification of proteins by the small ubiquitin (UBB;
191339)-like protein SUMO (see SUMO1, 601912) is implicated in the
regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, genomic stability, gene
transcription, and other processes. Sumoylation is catalyzed on target
lysine residues by a multienzyme process and is reversed by
desumoylating enzymes such as SENP1 (Yamaguchi et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast Ulp1, followed by PCR
of a placenta cDNA library and 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Gong et al.
(2000) cloned SENP1. The deduced 643-amino acid protein contains a
C-terminal domain that includes conserved histidine, aspartate, and
cysteine residues characteristic of cysteine proteases. SENP1 shares 21%
identity with yeast Ulp1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gong et al. (2000) determined that the SENP1 gene contains 18 exons and
spans 61 kb. Exon 3 contains the translational start codon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gong et al. (2000) mapped the SENP1 gene
to chromosome 12q13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Gong et al. (2000) showed that SENP1 removed the SUMO1 modification from
a sumoylated protein in transfected COS cells concomitant with the
accumulation of free SUMO1 monomers. It also removed SUMO2 (603042)
modifications, but not ubiquitin or NEDD8 (603171) modifications. SENP1
desumoylated the nuclear protein PML (102578), but not RanGAP1 (602362),
which resides on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. Since
SENP1 was able to remove the SUMO1 modification from RanGAP1 in vitro,
Gong et al. (2000) concluded that the inability of SENP1 to desumoylate
RanGAP1 in vivo is due to the SENP1 nuclear localization.

Veltman et al. (2005) identified a patient with an infantile
sacrococcygeal teratoma and a constitutional t(12;15)(q13;q25)
chromosomal translocation, resulting in SENP1/MESDC2 (607783) fusion
genes. Both reciprocal SENP1/MESDC2 (SEME) and MESDC2/SENP1 (MESE)
fusion genes were transcribed in tumor-derived cells, and their open
reading frames encoded aberrant proteins. In contrast to wildtype
MESDC2, the translocation-associated SEME protein was no longer targeted
to the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a presumed loss-of-function as
a chaperone for the WNT coreceptors LRP5 (603506) and/or LRP6 (603507).
SUMO, a posttranslational modifier, plays an important role in several
cellular key processes and is cleaved from its substrates by wildtype
SENP1. In vitro studies revealed that translocation-associated MESE
proteins exhibited desumoylation capacities similar to those observed
for wildtype SENP1. Veltman et al. (2005) speculated that spatiotemporal
disturbances in desumoylating activities during critical stages of
embryonic development might be responsible for teratoma formation. The
constitutional t(12;15)(q13;q25) translocation suggested SENP1 and
MESDC2 as candidate genes for neonatal/infantile germ cell tumor
development.

Xu et al. (2008) found that the activities of SENP1, SENP2 (608261), and
Ulp1 were inhibited by oxidation. Peroxide induced the formation of an
intermolecular disulfide linkage in SENP1 via the active-site cysteines
at positions 603 and 613. This reversible modification, also observed in
yeast Ulp1 but not in SENP2, conferred a higher recovery of enzyme
activity following inhibition, as well as protection against further
irreversible oxidation and enzyme inhibition. In vivo formation of a
disulfide-linked SENP1 dimer was also detected in cultured cells in
response to oxidative stress. Experiments examining the crystal
structures of Ulp1 under increasing oxidation of a catalytic cysteine
revealed that Ulp1 was extremely sensitive to mild oxidation, even at
the atmospheric oxygen level. Xu et al. (2008) concluded that SENP1 may
act as a redox sensor and modulate protein desumoylation and cellular
responses to oxidative stress.

Using mechanistic studies in human cells, Yu et al. (2010) found that
SENP1 directly desumoylated GATA1 and thereby regulated GATA1
DNA-binding activity, GATA1-dependent EPOR (133171) expression, and
erythropoiesis. They concluded that SENP1 promotes GATA1 activation and
subsequent erythropoiesis by desumoylating GATA1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamaguchi et al. (2005) found that homozygous disruption of the Senp1
gene in mice via a retroviral insertional mutation caused embryonic
lethality between embryonic days 12.5 and 14.5 due to placental
abnormalities. Senp1 -/- embryos showed increased steady-state levels of
the sumoylated forms of a number of proteins, including Rangap1
(602362).

Yu et al. (2010) observed erythropoietic defects in fetal liver of Senp1
-/- mice. These defects were accompanied by reduced activity of Gata1
and reduced expression of Gata1 target genes due to accumulation of
sumoylated Gata1.

188230	TITLE *188230 THY-1 T-CELL ANTIGEN; THY1
;;THETA ANTIGEN;;
CD90 ANTIGEN; CD90
DESCRIPTION Thy-1 is the designation for a major cell surface glycoprotein
characteristic to T cells, as first defined in the mouse and rat (Raff,
1971; Letarte-Muirhead et al., 1975). The Thy-1 glycoproteins are
constituents of thymocytes and neurons and probably are involved in
cell-cell interactions. The putative human homolog of Thy-1 of the mouse
is called K117. The human homolog of the rodent antigen was studied by
Ades et al. (1980). Using a monoclonal antibody, McKenzie and Fabre
(1981) studied the tissue distribution of the antigen. By use of a gene
clone in somatic cell hybrids, Seki et al. (1985) assigned the THY1 gene
to chromosome 11. Van den Elsen et al. (1985) predicted that the human
Thy-1 homolog maps to chromosome 11 because that is where they found T3D
(186790) to map and in the mouse T3D and Thy-1 map to chromosome 9 along
with certain other loci that are on human 11q. A multigene family is a
group of homologous genes with similar function. A supergene family is a
set of multigene families and single genes related by sequence (implying
common ancestry) but not necessarily related in function. Hood et al.
(1985) refer to the immunoglobulin supergene family which includes
Thy-1, poly-Ig receptor, heavy, kappa and lambda immunoglobulins, Lyt-2
(T8), alpha and beta chains of T-cell antigen receptor and the closely
homologous gamma chain, class I MHC antigen, beta-2-microglobulin, and
the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC antigens. Thy-1 is
structurally the simplest of these, consisting of a single
immunoglobulin homology unit that is either intermediate between V and C
or somewhat more similar to a V homology unit (Williams and Gagnon,
1982). The Thy-1 glycoprotein is also exceptional in that it is on the
cell surface as a free homology unit and apparently does not associate
either with itself or with other polypeptides. Its role in immune
response is unclear. It is expressed on fibroblasts and brain cells in
addition to some T cells. The significant role of Thy-1 in developing
nervous tissue (Morris, 1985) may be of relevance to disorders such as
ataxia-telangiectasia (208900) that combine neurologic and immunologic
defects. By somatic cell and in situ hybridization, van Rijs et al.
(1985) localized the gene to 11q23-11q24. Rettig et al. (1985) assigned
the gene to 11q13-qter, by Southern analysis of DNA from hybrid cells
containing rearranged chromosomes 11. HGM7 gave the regional assignment
as 11q22.3. Tunnacliffe and McGuire (1990) constructed a physical map of
11q23 by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and showed that THY1 lies in
11q23.3 as the most telomeric of a group of 6 genes:
cen--CD3E--CD3D--CD3G--PBGD--CBL2--THY1--qter.

Chromosome 11 seems to carry an inordinately large number of genes for
cell surface antigens (Rettig et al., 1985); according to the 1985
workshop on Human Gene Mapping (Grzeschik and Kazazian, 1985), at least
21 cellular antigens recognized by monoclonal antibodies and other
serologic means map to 11. Mansour et al. (1987) gave a useful history
of our understanding of the Thy-1 glycoprotein and a review of its
evolution. Using RFLPs, Gatti et al. (1987) mapped the THY1 gene against
APOA1 (107680). THY1 appeared to be distal to APOA1; there was 1%
recombination between the 2 loci in males and 2% in females. Gatti et
al. (1988) demonstrated RFLPs in the THY1 gene that are potentially
useful as markers in linkage studies. Greenspan and O'Brien (1989)
showed in the mouse that a factor secreted by nonneuronal accessory
cells of dorsal root ganglion cultures stimulates neurite outgrowth in
neonatal sympathetic ganglion neurons. They presented evidence that this
is identical to Thy-1. It is this function in separate tissues that
might explain pleiotropic manifestations of some syndromes such as
ataxia-telangiectasia (208900) or cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250).

Cao et al. (2001) found that introduction of chromosome 11 completely
suppressed tumorigenicity of the highly malignant and tumorigenic
ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 but introduction of chromosome 17 could
only partially suppress tumorigenicity. Microcell-mediated chromosome
transfer was applied to introduce a normal copy of chromosome 11 into
SKOV-3 cells; a panel of 5 hybrid clones were generated. Two of the
clones were completely nontumorigenic in severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice for up to 150 and 200 days; 2 other clones
had a latency period of 123 and 109 days, respectively. In vitro cell
doubling time was found to be highly variable and did not correlate with
tumorigenicity, implying that suppression of in vivo tumorigenicity and
in vitro cell proliferation are under separate genetic control. A number
of studies had demonstrated a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) of chromosome 11, both 11p and 11q, in ovarian cancer. To identify
the gene or genes associated with tumor suppression in the ovarian cell
line SKOV-3, Abeysinghe et al. (2003) performed cDNA subtractive
hybridization using a suppression subtractive hybridization method.
Using this approach, they identified the differential expression of the
cell surface glycoprotein THY1, the gene for which maps to 11q23.3. The
expression of THY1 was found to be exclusive in the 2 nontumorigenic
clones as determined by Northern blot analysis at the mRNA level and by
immunocytochemistry and quantitative flow cytometry at the protein
expression level. Several genes related to cell growth and
differentiation were found to be upregulated in the nontumorigenic
clones, including THBS1 (188060), SPARC (182120), and fibronectin
(135600).

602964	TITLE *602964 TRANSLIN-ASSOCIATED FACTOR X; TSNAX
;;TRAX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Translin (TSN; 600575) is a DNA-binding protein that specifically binds
to consensus sequences at breakpoint junctions of chromosomal
translocations in many cases of lymphoid malignancies. Aoki et al.
(1997) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to screen a human spleen cDNA
library for potential interactions of TSN with other proteins. They
isolated a TSNAX cDNA, termed TRAX (translin-associated factor X) by the
authors, whose product specifically interacted with TSN in
cotransformation and in vitro interaction assays. The cDNA encodes a
putative 290-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33
kD. The protein contains a heptad repeat of hydrophobic amino acids
consistent with the hypothetical leucine zipper structure. The authors
found 28% amino acid sequence identity between TSNAX and TSN, with 38%
identity in the C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis revealed a
single TSNAX transcript of 2.7 kb, with a tissue distribution similar to
that of the TSN transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2009) reconstituted long double-stranded RNA- and duplex
siRNA-initiated RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) activities with the
use of recombinant Drosophila Dicer-2 (see 606241), R2D2, and Ago2
(606229) proteins. They used this core reconstitution system to purify
an RNAi regulator that they termed C3PO (component 3 promoter of RISC),
a complex of translin and TRAX. C3PO is a magnesium ion-dependent
endoribonuclease that promotes RISC activation by removing siRNA
passenger strand cleavage products. Liu et al. (2009) showed that TRAX
is unstable without translin and that TRAX is the catalytic subunit of
C3PO. Liu et al. (2009) concluded that their study established an in
vitro RNAi reconstitution system and identified C3PO as a key activator
of the core RNAi machinery.

GENE STRUCTURE

Meng et al. (2000) determined that the genomic structure of TSNAX is
similar to that of TSN, consisting of 6 exons encompassing approximately
27 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Meng et al. (2000) mapped the
TSNAX gene to chromosome 1q41.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cannon et al. (2005) conducted a population-based twin cohort study in
Finland to examine the association of SNPs of DISC1 (605210) and TRAX
with schizophrenia (SCZD9; 604906) and several endophenotypic traits
thought to be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Two hundred and
thirty-six subjects consisting of 7 pairs concordant for schizophrenia
(6 monozygotic, 1 dizygotic), 52 pairs discordant for schizophrenia (20
monozygotic, 32 dizygotic), and 59 demographically balanced normal pairs
(28 monozygotic, 31 dizygotic) were drawn from a twin cohort consisting
of all same-sex twins born in Finland from 1940 through 1957. Diagnosis
was confirmed, and performance measurements on neurocognitive tests of
short- and long-term memory as well as gray matter volume measurements
as assessed on MRI images were recorded. A common haplotype
incorporating 3 SNPs near the translocation breakpoint of DISC1 (HEP1;
odds ratio, 2.6, p = 0.02) and a rare haplotype incorporating 4 markers
from the DISC1 and TRAX genes (combined HEP2/HEP3; odds ratio, 13.0, p =
0.001) were significantly overrepresented among individuals with
schizophrenia. These haplotypes were also associated with several
quantitative and endophenotypic traits including impairments in short-
and long-term memory, functioning, and reduced gray matter density in
the prefrontal cortex.

610480	TITLE *610480 LEM DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; LEMD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By microarray analysis to identify genes upregulated in colorectal
carcinomas, followed by database analysis, Yuki et al. (2004) identified
LEMD1. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.7-kb LEMD1 transcript
expressed in testis only. RT-PCR revealed 6 alternatively spliced LEMD1
transcripts in testis. The longest deduced protein, LEMD1A, contains 181
amino acids and has an N-terminal LEM domain. Of the 6 LEMD1 variants,
LEMD1B, which encodes a deduced 29-amino acid protein lacking the LEM
domain, showed highest expression in testis. LEMD1F, which encodes a
67-amino acid protein containing the N-terminal LEM domain, was detected
in 17 of 18 colon cancer tissues examined. Epitope-tagged LEMD1F was
expressed in transfected COS-7 cells at the nuclear membrane and
colocalized with transfected BAF (BANF1; 603811).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yuki et al. (2004) determined that the LEMD1 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LEMD1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH92566).

;;EIF3-p35;;
EIF3-ALPHA;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT 1, FORMERLY; EIF3S1,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (EIF3) has a molecular mass of about 600
kD and contains 13 nonidentical protein subunits, including EIF3J. EIF3
plays a central role in binding of initiator methionyl-tRNA and mRNA to
the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 40S initiation complex (Fraser et
al., 2004; Fraser et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching an EST database with partial protein sequences of the human
eIF3-p35 and eIF3-p44 (EIF3G; 603913) subunits, Block et al. (1998)
isolated cDNAs encoding p35 and p44. The predicted p35 protein contains
258 amino acids. Both p44 and p35 coimmunoprecipitated with p170,
indicating that they are components of the eIF3 complex. Northern blot
analysis revealed that p35 is expressed as an approximately 2.4-kb mRNA
in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using insect cells to express EIF3 subunits and an in vitro binding
assay, Fraser et al. (2004) identified EIF3J as the EIF3 component
required for stable 40S binding. EIF3J promoted binding of a core
subcomplex made up of EIF3B (603917), EIF3G, and EIF3I (603911).
Purified EIF3 lacking EIF3J bound 40S ribosomal subunits weakly, but it
bound tightly when EIF3J was added. Cleavage of a 16-residue C-terminal
peptide from EIF3J by caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) reduced its affinity for
the 40S ribosomal subunit, and the cleaved form provided substantially
less stabilization of purified EIF3-40S complexes.

Fraser et al. (2007) found that EIF3J bound directly to the mRNA entry
channel and aminoacyl site of the 40S subunit, placing EIF3J directly in
the ribosomal decoding center. EIF3J also interacted with EIF3A (602039)
and reduced 40S subunit affinity for mRNA. High affinity for mRNA was
restored upon recruitment of initiator tRNA, even though EIF3J remained
in the mRNA-binding cleft in the presence of tRNA. Fraser et al. (2007)
concluded that EIF3J governs the binding of initiation factors and mRNA
to form the initiation complex.

606450	TITLE *606450 NEUROEPITHELIAL CELL TRANSFORMING GENE 1; NET1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By expression cloning and PCR of a neuroepithelioma cell line, followed
by screening of a mammary epithelial cell line, Chan et al. (1996)
obtained a cDNA encoding NET1. Sequence analysis predicted that the
601-amino acid protein has a DBL homology (DH) domain that is 21%
similar to that of DBL (311030), particularly in the leucine-rich
region. The DH domain is a 240-amino acid region initially identified in
DBL. DH domain proteins interact with members of the RAS superfamily of
GTP-binding proteins. NET1 also possesses a pleckstrin-homology domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of major 3.0- and
minor 2.4-kb NET1 transcripts, with highest levels in placenta.
Functional analysis showed that NET1 induced morphologic alterations and
conferred a malignant phenotype in vitro and in nude mice.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chan et al. (1996) mapped the NET1 gene to 10p15, a region
involved in nonrandom translocation in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia
(ANLL).

603768	TITLE *603768 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 12B; PPP1R12B
;;MYOSIN PHOSPHATASE TARGET SUBUNIT 2; MYPT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The holoenzyme of smooth muscle myosin phosphatase consists of 3
subunits: the catalytic subunit PP1c-delta (PPP1CB; 600590), and 2
putative regulatory subunits, MYPT (myosin phosphatase target) and M20.
The N-terminal half of MYPT binds to both PP1c-delta and phosphorylated
myosin, thereby increasing myosin phosphatase activity. The C-terminal
region contains the phosphorylation site thought to be involved in
inhibition of phosphatase activity, as well as binding sites for M20 and
several other substances. The MYPT1 (602021) gene encodes one human MYPT
isoform. By screening a human brain cDNA library with a rat MYPT1 cDNA,
Fujioka et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding MYPT2, a second human
isoform. The predicted 982-amino acid MYPT2 protein shares 61% sequence
identity with MYPT1. Like MYPT1, MYPT2 contains 7 ankyrin repeats near
the N terminus and C-terminal leucine zipper motifs. Northern blot
analysis revealed that MYPT2 is expressed as multiple transcripts in a
tissue-specific pattern, with the strongest expression in heart and
skeletal muscle. Western blots detected the 125-kD MYPT2 protein only in
brain and heart, in contrast to MYPT1, which is widely distributed in
human tissues. In vitro, recombinant proteins containing the N-terminal
two-thirds of either MYPT2 or MYPT1 bound to PP1c-delta and increased
activity toward phosphorylated myosin light chain.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Fujioka et al. (1998) mapped the
MYPT2 gene to 1q32.1.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Multiprotein complexes are key determinants of Golgi apparatus structure
and its capacity for intracellular transport and glycoprotein
modification. Several complexes have been identified, including the
Golgi transport complex (GTC), the LDLC complex, which is involved in
glycosylation reactions, and the SEC34 complex, which is involved in
vesicular transport. These 3 complexes are identical and have been
termed the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, which includes COG2
(Ungar et al., 2002).

CLONING

Podos et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding LDLC by expressing human
genomic DNA in ldlC Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which have
defective LDLR (606945) expression due to glycosylation defects,
detecting corrected expression, probing a size-selected genomic DNA
library, Northern blot analysis of HeLa cells, and screening of a HeLa
cell cDNA library. Expression of LDLC alone in ldlC CHO cells, but not
in ldlB (606973) CHO cells, corrected LDLR expression. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 3.4-kb LDLC transcript in HeLa cells,
with lower expression in wildtype, but not mutant, CHO cells. LDLC is a
deduced 738-amino acid cytoplasmic protein. Immunofluorescence
microscopy indicated that LDLC is associated with the Golgi in CHO cells
and mouse fibroblasts.

By SDS-PAGE analysis of bovine brain cytosol, Ungar et al. (2002)
identified the 8 subunits of the COG complex. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated that COG1 (LDLB) colocalizes with COG7 (606978),
as well as with COG3 (606975) and COG5 (606821), with a Golgi marker in
a perinuclear distribution. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that all
COG subunits interact with COG2. Ungar et al. (2002) concluded that the
COG complex is critical for the structure and function of the Golgi
apparatus and can influence intracellular membrane trafficking.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the COG2
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG15532).

300128	TITLE *300128 LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 6A; KDM6A
;;UBIQUITOUSLY TRANSCRIBED TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT GENE ON X CHROMOSOME;
UTX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Greenfield et al. (1998) described the isolation of an X-linked homolog
of Uty (see 400009), called Utx (ubiquitously transcribed TPR gene on
the X chromosome), which is expressed from the inactive X chromosome in
both mice and humans.

MAPPING

Greenfield et al. (1998) determined that the mouse Utx gene maps to the
proximal region of the X chromosome in an interval containing the Maoa
(309850) and Maob (309860) genes, thus placing it in band A2-A3. By
Southern analysis of a panel of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids
carrying derivative X chromosomes, Greenfield et al. (1998) mapped the
human UTX gene to Xp11.3-p11.23. By fluorescence in situ hybridization
on normal human metaphase spreads, they refined the localization to
Xp11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lan et al. (2007) showed that the JmjC-domain-containing related
proteins UTX and JMJD3 (611577) catalyze demethylation of
tri/dimethylated histone H3 (see 602810) lysine-27 (H3K27me3/2). UTX is
enriched around the transcription start sites of many HOX genes in
primary human fibroblasts, in which HOX genes are differentially
expressed, but is selectively excluded from the HOX loci in embryonic
stem cells, in which HOX genes are largely silent. Consistently, RNA
interference inhibition of UTX led to increased H3K27me3 levels at some
HOX gene promoters. Importantly, morpholino oligonucleotide inhibition
of a zebrafish UTX homolog resulted in misregulation of HOX genes and a
striking posterior developmental defect, which was partially rescued by
wildtype, but not by catalytically inactive, human UTX. Lan et al.
(2007) concluded that, taken together, their findings identified a small
family of H3K27 demethylases with important evolutionarily conserved
roles in H3K27 methylation regulation and in animal anterior-posterior
development.

Agger et al. (2007) showed that human JmjC domain-containing UTX and
JMJD3 demethylate trimethylated lys27 on histone H3. Furthermore, the
authors demonstrated that ectopic expression of JMJD3 leads to a strong
decrease of H3K27me3 levels and causes delocalization of polycomb
proteins in vivo. Consistent with the strong decrease in H3K27me3 levels
associated with HOX genes during differentiation, Agger et al. (2007)
showed that UTX directly binds to the HOXB1 locus and is required for
its activation. Finally, mutation of F18E9.5, a C. elegans JMJD3
ortholog, or inhibition of its expression, resulted in abnormal gonad
development. Agger et al. (2007) concluded that, taken together, their
results suggested that H3K27me3 demethylation regulated by UTX/JMJD3
proteins is essential for proper development. Moreover, the recent
demonstration that UTX associates with the H3K4me3 histone
methyltransferase MLL2 (602113) (Issaeva et al., 2007), supported a
model in which the coordinated removal of repressive marks, polycomb
group displacement, and deposition of activating marks are important for
the stringent regulation of transcription during cellular
differentiation.

Lee et al. (2007) showed that human UTX, a member of the Jumonji C
family of proteins, is a di- and trimethyl H3K27 demethylase. UTX
occupies the promoters of HOX gene clusters (see 142950) and regulates
their transcriptional output by modulating the recruitment of polycomb
repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the monoubiquitination of histone H2A
(see 602786). Moreover, UTX associates with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)
2/3 complexes (602113, 606833, respectively), and during retinoic acid
signaling events, the recruitment of the UTX complex to HOX genes
results in H3K27 demethylation and a concomitant methylation of H3K4.
Lee et al. (2007) concluded that their results suggested a concerted
mechanism for transcriptional activation in which cycles of H3K4
methylation by MLL2/3 are linked with the demethylation of H3K27 through
UTX.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Van Haaften et al. (2009) described inactivating somatic mutations in
the histone lysine demethylase gene UTX, pointing to histone H3 lysine
methylation deregulation in multiple tumor types. UTX reintroduction
into cancer cells with inactivating UTX mutations resulted in slowing of
proliferation and marked transcriptional changes.

By array CGH analysis in 2 Belgian girls with Kabuki syndrome (see
KABUK2, 300867) who were negative for mutation in the MLL2 gene
(602113), Lederer et al. (2012) identified de novo Xp11.3
microdeletions, both of which contained part or all of the KDM6A gene.
In the 13-year-old girl, the 283.5-kb deletion included KDM6A exons 21
through 29, coding for the terminal part of the catalytic domain of
KDM6A, and CXORF36. In the 10-year-old girl, the 815.7-kb deletion
completely removed KDM6A, CXORF36, DUSP21 (300678) and FUNDC1 (300871).
Sequencing of the KDM6A gene as well as targeted array CGH in a cohort
of 22 MLL2-negative Kabuki syndrome patients revealed a de novo 45.4-kb
intragenic deletion in a 2-year-old Italian boy (300128.0001). Although
KDM6A escapes X inactivation, Lederer et al. (2012) found a skewed
X-inactivation pattern in both girls (89:11 and 97:3, respectively), in
which the deleted X chromosome was inactivated in the majority of the
cells.

Miyake et al. (2013) analyzed the KDM6A gene in 32 patients with Kabuki
syndrome who were negative for mutation in the MLL2 gene, and identified
nonsense mutations in 2 male patients and a 3-bp deletion in a female
patient (300128.0002-300128.0004). The female patient had fewer
dysmorphic features than the male patients, who displayed a more severe
phenotype with multiple organ involvement. Miyake et al. (2013)
suggested that the mutation type as well as X-inactivation pattern in
affected organs in females may determine the severity of Kabuki
syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Kruidenier et al. (2012) presented a structure-guided small-molecule and
chemoproteomics approach to elucidating the functional role of the
H3K27me3-specific demethylase subfamily (KDM6 subfamily members JMJD3,
611577 and UTX). The liganded structures of human and mouse JMJD3
provided novel insight into the specificity determinants for cofactor,
substrate, and inhibitor recognition by the KDM6 subfamily of
demethylases. Kruidenier et al. (2012) exploited these structural
features to generate the first small-molecule catalytic site inhibitor
that is selective for the H3K27me3-specific JMJ subfamily, and
demonstrated that this inhibitor binds in a novel manner and reduces
lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by human
primary macrophages, a process that depends on both JMJD3 and UTX.
Kruidenier et al. (2012) concluded that their results resolved the
ambiguity associated with the catalytic function of H3K27-specific JMJs
in regulating disease-relevant inflammatory responses and provided
encouragement for designing small-molecule inhibitors to allow selective
pharmacologic intervention across the JMJ family.

Mansour et al. (2012) demonstrated in mice and humans that the histone
H3 methylated lys27 (H3K27) demethylase Utx regulates the efficient
induction, rather than maintenance, of pluripotency. Murine embryonic
stem cells lacking Utx can execute lineage commitment and contribute to
adult chimeric animals; however, somatic cells lacking Utx fail to
robustly reprogram back to the ground state of pluripotency. Utx
directly partners with OSK reprogramming factors (OCT4, 164177; SOX2,
184429; KLF4, 602253) and uses its histone demethylase catalytic
activity to facilitate induced pluripotent stem cell formation. Genomic
analysis indicates that Utx depletion results in aberrant dynamics of
H3K27me3 repressive chromatin demethylation in somatic cells undergoing
reprogramming. The latter directly hampers the derepression of potent
pluripotency promoting gene modules (including Sall1, Sall4, and Utf1),
which can cooperatively substitute for exogenous OSK supplementation in
iPSC formation. Remarkably, Utx safeguards the timely execution of
H3K27me3 demethylation observed in embryonic day 10.5-11 primordial germ
cells (PGCs), and Utx-deficient PGCs show cell-autonomous aberrant
epigenetic reprogramming dynamics during their embryonic maturation in
vivo. Subsequently, this disrupts PGC development by embryonic day 12.5,
and leads to diminished germline transmission in mouse chimeras
generated from Utx-knockout pluripotent cells. Thus, Mansour et al.
(2012) concluded that they identified Utx as a novel mediator with
distinct functions during the reestablishment of pluripotency and germ
cell development. They furthermore concluded that their findings
highlighted the principle that molecular regulators mediating loss of
repressive chromatin during in vivo germ cell reprogramming can be
co-opted during in vitro reprogramming towards ground state
pluripotency.
