609409	TITLE *609409 HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN A0; HNRNPA0
;;HNRPA0
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The processing of heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs) is mediated by
large protein-RNA complexes termed heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes. At least 20 major proteins and
numerous less abundant proteins have been identified electrophoretically
as hnRNP complex proteins. HNRNPA0 is a member of a major class of these
proteins, the A/B family, typified by a characteristic primary structure
containing 2 RNA binding domains followed by a glycine-rich C terminus
(summary by Myer and Steitz, 1995).

CLONING

By screening a human brain cDNA library with a CCG-repeat
oligonucleotide probe, Li et al. (1993) identified a partial clone
encoding HNRPA0. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 4.5-kb
HNRPA0 transcript in human frontal cerebral cortex and cerebellar
cortex.

While attempting to isolate an AUUUA-binding protein implicated in mRNA
instability, Myer and Steitz (1995) isolated a novel low-abundance hnRNP
protein. Peptide sequencing revealed the isolated protein to be
identical to the partial HNRPA0 cDNA previously isolated by Li et al.
(1993). Myer and Steitz (1995) subsequently cloned full-length HNRPA0
from a human placenta cDNA library and determined that HNRPA0 encodes a
protein of 305 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 31.7 kD.
HNRPA0 contains 2 RNA-binding domains followed by a glycine-rich C
terminus. The HNRPA0 protein shares 58% and 64% similarity to hnRNPA1
(164017) and A2 (see 600124) respectively. Northern blot analysis showed
expression of 2 HNRPA0 transcripts of 1.7 and 2.8 kb in peripheral blood
leukocytes, colon, small intestine, ovary, testis, prostate, thymus, and
spleen. The ratio of the 2 HNRPA0 transcripts varied among tissues
tested.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation of HNRPA0 with antibodies against HNRNPA1,
HNRNPC1/C2 (164020), and HNRNPU (602869), Myer and Steitz (1995) showed
that HNRPA0 is associated with HNRNP complexes. In vitro crosslinking
experiments showed that HNRPA0 protein binds to AUUUA elements.

Lai et al. (2001) identified 3 polyadenylation sites within the HNRPA0
gene, use of which generate 3 RNA isoforms of 1.7, 2.8, and 3.9 kb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the HNRNPA0 gene is intronless and
spans 3.9 kb.

MAPPING

Lai et al. (2001) generated a transcript map of a 1.5-Mb region within
chromosome 5q31 and mapped the HNRNPA0 gene between D5S479 and D5S500.

611204	TITLE *611204 COILED-COIL DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 88C; CCDC88C
;;HOOK-RELATED PROTEIN 2; HKRP2;;
DAPLE;;
KIAA1509
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CCDC88C gene encodes the DVL1 (601365)-binding protein DAPLE. The
DAPLE-DVL1 homodimer functions as a negative regulator of the canonical
WNT (see, e.g., WNT3A, 606359) signaling pathway by promoting
beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) degradation (Oshita et al., 2003; summary
by Ekici et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CCDC88C, which they designated
KIAA1509. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in adult lung and
amygdala, and low levels in all other tissues tested.

Based on in silico analysis, Simpson et al. (2005) found that CCDC88C,
which they called HKRP2, encodes a deduced 2,028-amino acid protein with
sequence similarity to HKRP1 (609736).

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with the sequence of Dvl (601365) as
probe, Oshita et al. (2003) identified the mouse homolog of CCDC88C from
a brain cDNA library. The deduced 2,009-amino acid protein was high in
leucine residues, leading the authors to name the protein Daple
(Dvl-associating protein with a high frequency of leucine residues).

Ekici et al. (2010) found expression of the CCDC88C gene in the fetal
brain, especially in the pons and cerebellum, and in the adult cortex.
The highest expression in adult tissues was in the pancreas. Expression
was also high in fetal and adult kidney and in fetal thymus.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the CCDC88C
gene to chromosome 14.

GENE FUNCTION

Oshita et al. (2003) found that the C terminus of Daple was necessary
for binding to the PDZ domain of Dvl. When expressed in mouse
fibroblasts, Daple inhibited Wnt3a (606359)-induced accumulation of
beta-catenin (116806) as well as the Wnt3a-dependent activation of
T-cell factor (Tcf) transcription. Daple expression in Xenopus embryos
inhibited axis formation, another process regulated by the Wnt signaling
pathway.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents, with nonsyndromic
hydrocephalus (HYC; 236600), Ekici et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
splice site mutation in the CCDC88C gene (611204.0001), resulting in
premature termination. An affected fetus, a sib of the girl, was also
found to carry this homozygous mutation. The mutation was found by
homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing. Protein and
gene expression profiling indicated disturbed regulation of the WNT
signaling pathway.

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with HYC, Drielsma et al.
(2012) identified 2 different homozygous mutations in the CCDC88C gene
(611204.0002-611204.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYDROCEPHALUS, NONSYNDROMIC, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
CCDC88C, IVS29DS, G-A, +1

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents, with nonsyndromic
hydrocephalus (HYC; 236600), Ekici et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
G-to-A transition in intron 29 of the CCDC88C gene (c.5058+1G-A),
resulting in the skipping of exon 29 and premature termination
(Ser1591HisfsTer7). The mutation resulted in loss of the terminal DVL1
(601365)-binding site. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 224 German controls. The same
homozygous mutation was found in an affected fetus of this same couple.
The patient had normal psychomotor development at age 3 years. Western
blot analysis confirmed absence of the wildtype protein in the patient.
However, the patient had 8.3-fold increased expression of CCDC88C,
indicating absence of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and possibly
resulting from a feedback mechanism due to loss of function. In
addition, the patient showed increased expression of beta-catenin
(116806) and significant downregulation of many genes in the Wnt
(606359) signaling pathway, which may reflect a disturbed complex
negative feedback loop.

In 4 sibs, born of unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish parents, with nonsyndromic
hydrocephalus (236600), Drielsma et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
c.934C-T transition in the CCDC88C gene, resulting in an arg312-to-ter
(R312X) substitution. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was found in 1 of 721 Ashkenazi controls. All patients
were developmentally delayed, with moderate to severe mental retardation
and motor impairment; one 18-year-old was severely affected and only
able to sit.

.0003
HYDROCEPHALUS, NONSYNDROMIC, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
CCDC88C, 2-BP DEL, 5841AG

In 4 fetuses, the products of consanguineous Palestinian parents, with
nonsyndromic hydrocephalus (236600), Drielsma et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 2-bp deletion (AG) in the last exon (exon 30) of the CCDC88C
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Glu1949GlyfsTer26) causing loss of the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain.
The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Drielsma
(2013) stated that the mutation was c.5841_5842delAG.

DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. See
NDUFA2 (602137). By a combination of EST database searching and PCR,
Loeffen et al. (1998) isolated human cDNAs encoding NDUFC2 and 7 other
complex I subunits. The predicted 119-amino acid human protein is 74%
identical to B14.5B, the bovine homolog.

603571	TITLE *603571 VANIN 2; VNN2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mouse vanin-1 (see VNN1; 603570) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored cell surface molecule that is involved in the thymus
homing of bone marrow cells. By screening cDNA libraries with a mouse
vanin-1 cDNA, Galland et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA
encoding vanin-2 (VNN2), a vanin-like protein. Using RACE PCR to isolate
additional cDNAs, they determined the entire VNN2 coding sequence. The
deduced VNN2 protein shares 64% sequence identity with mouse vanin-1 and
VNN1, the human homolog of mouse vanin-1. Like VNN1, VNN2 contains a
C-terminal GPI cleavage motif; however, it lacks a leader peptide. VNN2
translated in vitro migrated as a 53-kD protein. Northern blot analysis
revealed that the 2.3-kb VNN2 mRNA is expressed in spleen, thymus,
peripheral blood lymphocytes, and kidney.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of somatic cell
hybrids, Galland et al. (1998) mapped the VNN2 gene to 6q23-q24. They
identified a YAC clone from 6q23-q24 that contained both the VNN1 and
VNN2 genes.

CUG-BINDING PROTEIN; CUGBP;;
NUCLEAR POLYADENYLATED RNA-BINDING PROTEIN, 50-KD; NAB50;;
BRUNO-LIKE 2; BRUNOL2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF1, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

An unstable CTG triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene (605377) is
responsible for myotonic dystrophy (DM1; 160900). To detect proteins
that bind to CTG triplet repeats, Timchenko et al. (1996) performed
bandshift analysis using as probes double-stranded DNA fragments having
CTG repeats and single-stranded oligonucleotides having CTG repeats or
RNA CUG repeats. The proteins were derived from nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts of HeLa cells, fibroblasts, and myotubes. Proteins binding to
the double-stranded DNA repeat were inhibited by the nonlabeled repeat
but not by a nonspecific DNA fragment. Another protein binding to the
single-stranded CTG probe and the RNA CUG probe was inhibited by
nonlabeled CTG(8) and CUG(8) repeats. The protein binding only to the
RNA repeat (CUG)8 was inhibited by nonlabeled (CUG)8 but not by
nonlabeled single- or double-stranded CTG repeats. Furthermore, the
protein, designated CUG-binding protein (CUGBP) by the authors,
exhibited no binding to an RNA oligonucleotide of triplet repeats of the
same length but having a different sequence, CGG. The CUG-binding
protein was localized to the cytoplasm, whereas double-stranded DNA
binding proteins were localized to the nuclear extract. Thus, Timchenko
et al. (1996) concluded that several trinucleotide-binding proteins
exist and their specificity is determined by the triplet sequence.

CTG trinucleotide repeats encode CUG repeat regions in the corresponding
mRNAs. Timchenko et al. (1996) identified 2 proteins, termed CUGBP1 and
CUGBP2, that bind specifically to CUG repeats in RNA. They suggested
that these 2 proteins, with masses of 49 kD and 51 kD, respectively, are
isoforms encoded by the same gene. Timchenko et al. (1996) cloned a
gene, termed NAB50 by them, based on the interaction between its protein
product and the yeast Nab2 protein. The authors stated that the NAB50
gene encodes the CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 proteins because anti-Nab50
antibodies crossreacted with both CUGBP isoforms. The gene predicts a
482-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52 kD. The
predicted protein contains 3 RNA-binding domains and is homologous to
the hnRNPs.

Good et al. (2000) identified CUGBP1 as BRUNOL2, a member of a human
gene family related to the transcriptional regulator 'Bruno' of
Drosophila. By PCR, they cloned BRUNOL2 from a brain cDNA library. The
deduced protein contains 2 N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a
long linker region, and a C-terminal RRM. BRUNOL2 and BRUNOL3 (CUGBP2;
602538) share 80% amino acid identity overall and more than 92% identity
in their RRMs. Good et al. (2000) determined that the BRUNOL2 cDNA and
the CUGBP1 cDNA reported by Timchenko et al. (1996) differ in their
3-prime UTRs due to alternative splicing. Good et al. (2000) also
identified a BRUNOL2 splice variant with an additional 12 bp, resulting
in a 4-amino acid insertion in the linker region. Northern blot analysis
detected variable expression of 3 major BRUNOL2 transcripts of about
9.5, 7.5, and 2.4 kb in all tissues examined.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) confirmed ubiquitous
expression of CUGBP1.

GENE FUNCTION

Timchenko et al. (1996) showed that the NAB50 gene product bound the CUG
repeat region of DMPK.

Using 2 biologic systems with reduced DMPK levels, a homozygous DM
patient and DMPK knockout mice, Roberts et al. (1997) demonstrated that
the intracellular distribution of CUGBP isoforms was altered in the
absence of DMPK. DMPK phosphorylated the CUGBP protein in vitro,
suggesting regulation of nuclear CUGBP localization via phosphorylation.

Using ultraviolet light crosslinking and gel mobility shift assays, Good
et al. (2000) showed that BRUNOL2 bound RNA containing a BRUNO response
element (BRE).

Dudaronek et al. (2007) showed that Ifnb (147720) induced expression of
Lip, a truncated, dominant-negative isoform of Cebpb (189965), and
suppressed active simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication in
macaque macrophages. In a human monocyte cell line, IFNB induced
phosphorylation of CUGBP1 and formation of CUGBP1-CEBPB mRNA complexes.
Depletion of Cugbp1 in macaque macrophages via small interfering RNA
showed that Cugbp1 was required for Ifnb-mediated induction of Lip and
for Ifnb-mediated suppression of SIV replication. Dudaronek et al.
(2007) concluded that CUGBP1 is a downstream effector of IFNB signaling
in primary macrophages that plays an important role in innate immune
responses controlling acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or SIV
replication in brain.

A transgenic fly model of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome
(FXTAS; 300623) in which the 5-prime UTR of human FMR1 (309550)
containing 90 CGG repeats is expressed specifically in the eye results
in disorganized ommatidia, depigmentation, and progressive loss of
photoreceptor neurons. Sofola et al. (2007) found that overexpression of
human CUGBP1 suppressed the neurodegenerative eye phenotype in
transgenic flies. CUGBP1 did not interact directly with the CGG repeats,
but did so via HNRNPA2B1 (600124). Expression of the A2 isoform of human
HNRNPA2B1, or the Drosophila orthologs, also suppressed the eye
phenotype of FXTAS flies. CUGBP1 did not interact with other HNRNPs
examined.

Tang et al. (2012) observed altered splicing of the calcium channel
subunit CAV1.1 (CACNA1S; 114208) in muscle of patients with DM1 and DM2
(602668) compared with normal adult muscle and muscle of patients with
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD; see 158900). A significant
fraction of CAV1.1 transcripts in DM1 and DM2 muscle showed skipping of
exon 29, which represents a fetal splicing pattern. Forced exclusion of
exon 29 in normal mouse skeletal muscle altered channel gating
properties and increased current density and peak electrically evoked
calcium transient magnitude. Downregulation of Mbnl1 (606516) in mouse
cardiac muscle or overexpression of Cugbp1 in mouse tibialis anterior
muscle enhanced skipping of exon 29, suggesting that these splicing
factors may be involved in the CAV1.1 splicing defect in myotonic
dystrophy.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the CUGBP1 gene
to chromosome 11p11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2007) generated an inducible and heart-specific mouse model
of DM1 that expressed expanded human DMPK CUG-repeat RNA and
recapitulated pathologic features of the human disorder, including
dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and systolic and diastolic
dysfunction. The mice also showed misregulation of developmental
alternative splicing transitions, including the Tnnt2 (191045) and Fxr1
(600819) genes. All died of heart failure within 2 weeks.
Immunohistochemical studies showed increased CUGBP1 protein levels
specifically in nuclei containing foci of DMPK CUG-repeat RNA. A
time-course study showed that increased CUGBP1 cooccurred within hours
of induced expression of the CUG repeat and coincided with reversion to
embryonic splicing patterns. The results indicated that increased CUGBP1
is a specific and early event of DM1 pathogenesis and represents a
primary response to expression of DMPK CUG-repeat mutant RNA.

Koshelev et al. (2010) expressed human CUGBP1 in adult mouse heart.
Upregulation of CUGBP1 was sufficient to reproduce molecular,
histopathologic, and functional changes observed in a DM1 mouse model
that expressed expanded CUG RNA repeats (Wang et al., 2007) as well as
in individuals with DM1. The authors concluded that CUGBP1 upregulation
plays an important role in DM1 pathogenesis.

By inducing expression of human CUGBP1 in adult skeletal muscle of
transgenic mice, Ward et al. (2010) showed that the pathogenic features
of DM1 could be explained by upregulated CUGBP1 expression. Within weeks
of induction of CUGBP1 expression, transgenic mice exhibited impaired
movement, reduced muscle function, abnormal gait, and reduced total body
weight compared with uninduced controls. Histologic analysis of
transgenic muscle overexpressing CUGBP1 revealed centrally located
nuclei, myofiber degeneration with inflammatory infiltrate, and pyknotic
nuclear clumps. RT-PCR analysis revealed reversion to embryonic splicing
patterns in several genes in transgenic muscle overexpressing CUGBP1.
Ward et al. (2010) concluded that CUGBP1 has a major role in DM1
skeletal muscle pathogenesis.

607587	TITLE *607587 INTERLEUKIN 17D; IL17D
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL17D is a member of the unique IL17 family, which share a conserved
cysteine motif. IL17D regulates cytokine production in endothelial cells
and inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro (Starnes et al., 2002).

CLONING

Using nested RACE PCR, Starnes et al. (2002) obtained a cDNA encoding
IL17D. The predicted 202-amino acid protein, the longest in the IL17
family, contains a signal peptide, conserved cysteines that allow
homodimer formation, and a unique extended C-terminal domain. RT-PCR
analysis showed high expression in skeletal muscle, brain, adipose,
heart, lung, and pancreas, with lower expression in bone marrow, fetal
liver, kidney, leukocytes, liver, lymph node, placenta, spleen, thymus,
tonsil, resting CD4 (186940)-positive T cells, and resting CD19
(107265)-positive B cells. Western blot analysis indicated expression of
monomeric and dimeric proteins of 26 and 53 kD, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Starnes et al. (2002) showed that purified recombinant IL17D inhibited
myeloid progenitor cell colony formation. IL17D enhanced endothelial
cell production of IL6 (147620), IL8 (146930), and GMCSF (CSF2; 138960),
but not other cytokines. The increased expression of IL8 was found to be
NFKB (see 164011)-dependent. IL17D did not stimulate proliferation of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Starnes et al. (2002) mapped the IL17D
gene to chromosome 13p11, a region linked to translocations in Hodgkin
lymphoma (236000).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The response to elevation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels following extra-
or intracellular stimuli is mediated by proteins that are capable of
binding divalent calcium ions. A particular class of these proteins is
characterized by the so-called EF-hand, a helix-loop-helix motif
involved in coordinating the Ca(2+) ion. Within the EF-hand superfamily,
a distinct set of proteins is grouped in the so-called S-100 protein
family (see S100A1; 176940 and S100B; 176990), whose members share a
high degree of sequence similarity with S-100A and S-100B,
Ca(2+)-binding proteins originally isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
Protein p11 (calpactin I, light chain) is a member of the S-100 family
but has several unique features. It has suffered crucial deletions and
amino acid substitutions which are thought to render both Ca(2+)-binding
sites inactive. In all tissues and cells studied, p11 is found in a
heterotetrameric complex with another Ca(2+)-binding protein, annexin II
(ANX2, LIP2; 151740). Some of the biochemical properties of annexin II
are modulated by p11-induced complex formation, which involves the
binding of one p11 dimer to 2 annexin II monomers. The p11 calpactin I
light chain is an intracellular polypeptide of 97 amino acid residues
that associates with the calpactin I heavy chain, p36, to form a
calcium-binding complex (Saris et al., 1987). The p11 subunit is a
protein kinase substrate and likely plays a role in the regulation of
p36 phosphorylation/activity.

CLONING

Harder et al. (1992) isolated the gene encoding p11 (CLP11) from a human
genomic library. Restriction mapping and sequencing showed that CLP11
covers a stretch of approximately 11 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

By a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a rat sensory neuron cDNA library, Okuse
et al. (2002) found that S100A10, which they called annexin II light
chain, or p11, interacts with the N-terminal intracellular domain of a
rat tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel, NaV1.8 (SCN10A; 604427).
Transfection of p11 into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably
expressing rat NaV1.8 demonstrated that p11 behaves as an accessory beta
subunit, promoting the translocation of NaV1.8 to the plasma membrane
and generating functional sodium channels.

By in vitro pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Girard et al.
(2002) found that human p11 interacted directly with the potassium
channel TASK1 (603220). The association of TASK1 with p11 required the
last 3 C-terminal amino acids of TASK1, ser-ser-val. Using a series of
C-terminal TASK1 deletion mutants and chimeras, Girard et al. (2002)
demonstrated that the association with p11 was essential for TASK1
trafficking to the plasma membrane. The binding of p11 to TASK1 also
masked an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal on TASK1 (lys-arg-arg)
that precedes the ser-ser-val sequence.

Svenningsson et al. (2006) found that the serotonin 1B receptor (5HT1B;
182131) interacts with p11. p11 increases localization of 5HT1B
receptors at the cell surface. p11 was increased in rodent brains by
antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy, but decreased in an animal
model of depression and in brain tissue from depressed patients.
Overexpression of p11 increased 5HT1B receptor function in cells and
recapitulated certain behaviors seen after antidepressant treatment in
mice. p11 knockout mice exhibited a depression-like phenotype and had
reduced responsiveness to 5HT1B receptor agonists and reduced behavioral
reactions to antidepressants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Harder et al. (1992) determined that, as in other genes encoding S-100
proteins, the transcribed region of the p11 gene is divided by 2
introns, one in the 5-prime untranslated portion and the other in the
protein coding region. As in all other S-100 genes, the second intron
separates the codons for 2 corresponding amino acids which reside in the
sequence connecting the 2 helix-loop-helix (EF-hand) motifs. The 5-prime
untranslated region, which most likely represents the CLP11 promoter, is
characterized by high G+C content and is probably part of a CpG island.
Several putative binding sites for transcription factors were identified
in the 5-prime untranslated region. Among them, the beta-DRE element,
which was first described in the beta-globin promoter (141900), is most
notable, since it is also present in the promoter of the ANX2 gene. It
could be responsible for the simultaneous induction of CLP11 and ANX2
expression during certain cell differentiation processes.

Huang et al. (2003) determined the promoter region of the S100A10 gene
lacks a TATA box, but has an incomplete CAAT box and 2 clusters of
putative regulatory elements, which together include gamma-interferon
(IFNG; 147570)-activated sequences (GAS), a gamma-iron-responsive
element (IRE), and binding sites for AP1 (see JUN, 165160), SP1
(189906), and AP2 (107580).

MAPPING

Kube et al. (1991) and Dooley et al. (1992) cloned and sequenced the
cDNA for the full-length human p11 calpactin I light chain. In
connection with the location of the gene on human chromosome 1
(predicted by homology with the mouse), it is notable that several
S100-related genes--CAGA (S100A8; 123885), CAGB (S100A9; 123886), CACY
(S100A6; 114110), and CAPL (S100A4; 114210)--are also located on 1q in
its proximal portion. Dooley (1992) indicated that the calpactin I light
chain (p11) is distinct from calgranulin A (CAGA; also known as S100A8).
The CAGA gene codes for the 11-kD subunit of a cystic fibrosis antigen.
Volz et al. (1993) demonstrated that the human CAL1L gene is indeed on
1q21, physically linked within 2.05 Mb of DNA to the genes encoding
trichohyalin (190370), filaggrin (135940), involucrin (147360), loricrin
(152445), and calcyclin (S100A6; 114110), in that order. The mouse p11
gene is located on chromosome 3 in a region of homology with human
chromosome 1, i.e., 1q21. The mouse gene is highly expressed in a number
of epithelial-containing tissues such as intestine, kidney, and lung.

NOMENCLATURE

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from 1q21 on which 9 different
genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be localized. The
clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction of a new
logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome, with S100A1 (176940) being closest to the telomere and
S100A9 being closest to the centromere. In the new nomenclature, CAL1L
became S100A10.

ANIMAL MODEL

By inducing a peritoneal inflammatory response in S100a10-deficient
mice, O'Connell et al. (2010) showed that S100a10 was necessary for
macrophage migration in vivo and for plasmin (173350) production in
vitro. Loss of S100a10 also resulted in decreased activation of pro-Mmp9
(120361). O'Connell et al. (2010) concluded that S100A10 is directly
involved in macrophage recruitment in response to inflammatory stimuli.

602623	TITLE *602623 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 5; FKBP5
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 51-KD; FKBP51;;
FKBP54
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Nair et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA for human FKBP51 from a HeLa cell cDNA
library. The FKBP51 cDNA encodes a predicted 457-amino acid polypeptide
with 90% identity to mouse fkbp51 and 55% identity to FKBP52 (600611).
Baughman et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding human FKBP51 by screening
a human thymus cDNA library with a fragment of the murine Fkbp51 cDNA.
The human FKBP51 cDNA encodes a deduced 457-amino acid protein that
shows 87% sequence identity to the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis
revealed that treatment of leukemic T cells with glucocorticoids results
in a marked increase in expression of a 3.7-kb transcript. Western blot
analysis showed that unlike the predominant T-cell expression of the
mouse protein, FKBP51 is expressed as a 51-kD protein in a variety of
tissues but not in brain, colon, or lung. The expression is frequently
in molar excess of that of FKBP12 (FKBP1A; 186945), but its capacity to
inhibit calcineurin is significantly lower than that of FKBP1A.

Baughman et al. (1995) and Yeh et al. (1995) cloned and characterized
the mouse Fkbp51 gene. Baughman et al. (1995) isolated the gene based on
its induction during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in murine thymoma
cells. Murine Fkbp51 encodes a 456-amino acid polypeptide with a
predicted mass of 51 kD. Yeh et al. (1995) isolated the mouse gene based
on the selective accumulation of its transcript during adipocyte
differentiation. By Northern blot analysis, the gene is expressed in a
variety of tissues, with highest levels in liver, skeletal muscle, and
kidney.

MAPPING

International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FKBP51 gene
to chromosome 6 (TMAP RH47153).

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Baughman et al. (1995) showed that the murine
Fkbp51 gene is expressed in all tissues, most abundantly in T
lymphocytes and in the thymus. Baughman et al. (1995) showed that FKBP5
has PPIase activity and is inhibited by rapamycin and FK520, a
structural analog that is virtually identical to FK506. Yeh et al.
(1995) showed that the PPIase activity of murine Fkbp51 is inhibited by
FK506 but not by cyclosporin A.

Nair et al. (1997) showed that FKBP51 is inhibited by FK506 but not by
cyclosporine. The authors demonstrated that FKBP51 and FKBP52 bind to
Hsp90 (140571) in a competitive manner. Nair et al. (1997) also showed
that Hsp90, Hsp70 (140550), and p23 (607061), a component of the
progesterone receptor complex, bind directly or indirectly to FKBP51.

Vermeer et al. (2003) studied whether the glucocorticoid-induced
increase of the mRNA encoding FKBP5 could be used for the development of
a novel assay, ultimately to be used in native human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Glucocorticoid addition to human
lymphoblastoid cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase of FKBP5 mRNA
levels within 2 hours, followed by a further increase until 24 hours.
Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR yielded similar results.
Coincubation of glucocorticoids with the glucocorticoid receptor
(138040) antagonist ORG34116 or the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide suggested a direct, glucocorticoid receptor-mediated
upregulation of FKBP5 gene transcription. They concluded that the
induction of FKBP5 mRNA by glucocorticoids may be a suitable marker to
assess individual glucocorticoid sensitivity, the in vitro measurement
of glucocorticoid potency, and the in vivo determination of
glucocorticoid bioavailability.

Using gene expression microarrays, Woodruff et al. (2007) found that
CLCA1 (603906), periostin (POSTN; 608777), and SERPINB2 (PAI2; 173390)
were upregulated in airway epithelial cells of individuals with asthma
(see 600807), but not smokers. Corticosteroid treatment downregulated
expression of these 3 genes and upregulated expression of FKBP51. High
baseline expression of CLCA1, POSTN, and SERPINB2 was associated with a
good clinical response to corticosteroids, whereas high expression of
FKBP51 was associated with a poor response.

Tissing et al. (2007) found that 8 hours of prednisolone treatment
altered expression of 51 genes in leukemic cells from children with
precursor-B- or T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with nonexposed
cells. The 3 most highly upregulated genes were FKBP5, ZBTB16 (176797),
and TXNIP (606599), which were upregulated 35.4-, 8.8-, and 3.7-fold,
respectively.

Attwood et al. (2011) demonstrated in mice that the serine protease
neuropsin (60564) is critical for stress-related plasticity in the
amygdala by regulating the dynamics of the EphB2 (600997)-NMDA receptor
interaction, the expression of Fkbp5, and anxiety-like behavior. Stress
results in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala,
causing dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 (138249) subunit of the NMDA
receptor and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic
EphB2-NR1 interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkpb5 gene
expression, and enhances behavioral signatures of anxiety. On stress,
neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation
from NR1, resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated
induction of the Fkbp5 gene, and low anxiety. The behavioral response to
stress can be restored by intraamygdala injection of neuropsin into
neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either
anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of
wildtype mice. Attwood et al. (2011) concluded that their findings
established a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis
of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The stress hormone-regulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
has been implicated in the causality as well as the treatment of
depression (608516). To investigate a possible association between genes
regulating the HPA axis and response to antidepressants and
susceptibility for depression, Binder et al. (2004) genotyped
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 of these genes in depressed
individuals and matched controls. They found significant associations of
response to antidepressants and the recurrence of depressive episodes
with SNPs in FKBP5, a glucocorticoid receptor-regulating cochaperone of
hsp90 (see 140571), in 2 independent samples. These SNPs were also
associated with increased intracellular FKBP5 protein expression, which
triggers adaptive changes in glucocorticoid receptor and, thereby, HPA
axis regulation. Individuals carrying the associated genotypes had less
HPA-axis hyperactivity during the depressive episode. Binder et al.
(2004) proposed that the FKBP5 variant-dependent alterations in HPA-axis
regulation could be related to the faster response to antidepressant
drug treatment and the increased recurrence of depressive episodes
observed in this group of depressed individuals. These findings
supported a central role of genes regulating the HPA axis in the
causality of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressant
drugs.

In 294 individuals with major depressive disorder (608516) and 339
matched controls, Binder et al. (2004) found that individuals homozygous
for the T allele of a C/T polymorphism in the FKBP5 gene, dbSNP
rs1360780, had an accelerated response to antidepressants over 5 weeks
of treatment. The responses of CT heterozygotes and CC homozygotes were
significantly slower than those of TT homozygotes and were almost
identical to each other. The authors also found that individuals with
the TT genotype had experienced more than twice as many depressive
episodes before the index episode, suggesting that these individuals
have more lifetime depressive episodes in addition to their faster
response to antidepressant drugs.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Uvomorulin is a specific calcium ion-dependent cell adhesion molecule.
In mice it expresses its adhesive function during the preimplantation
stage of development and in epithelial cells, where it is concentrated
in the intermediate junctions.

CLONING

Mansouri et al. (1987) examined the amino acid sequence of uvomorulin
and concluded that the gene is highly conserved. Sequence comparison
showed extensive similarity to chicken LCAM. Using the mouse cDNA clone,
Mansouri et al. (1987) screened a human liver cDNA library and isolated
a 2-kb cDNA clone containing coding sequences for human uvomorulin.
Sequence comparison showed over 80% identity to the mouse in both
nucleotide and amino acid sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Berx et al. (1995) cloned the human E-cadherin gene and showed that it
has 16 exons spanning approximately 100 kb of genomic DNA. The gene
structure is similar to that of other cadherins.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from a panel of mouse-human somatic cell
hybrids, Mansouri et al. (1987, 1988) assigned the UVO gene to 16q
(16p11-qter). In the mouse the Um locus is on chromosome 8 (Mansouri et
al., 1987; Eistetter et al., 1988), together with a number of other loci
that are located on human 16q (Scherer et al., 1989). Using a cDNA probe
for the human UVO gene, Natt et al. (1989) performed Southern blot
analysis of 2 overlapping interstitial deletions on human chromosome 16q
and thereby assigned the UVO locus to 16q22.1, distal to LCAT (606967)
and proximal to HP (140100) and TAT (613018). Chen et al. (1991)
confirmed the assignment to chromosome 16 and concluded that UVO is
located near LCAT in band 16q22.1. Starting with a human-hamster cell
hybrid carrying a single copy of chromosome 16 as the only human genetic
material, Ceccherini et al. (1992) generated radiation hybrids retaining
unselected fragments of this human chromosome. The most likely order and
location of 38 DNA sequences including the UVO gene and the TAT gene
were established by multiple pairwise analysis and scaled to estimate
the physical distance in megabases. The experiments illustrated the
usefulness of radiation hybrids for mapping. Berx et al. (1995)
confirmed the map position of CDH1 to 16q22.1 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Overduin et al. (1995) determined the 3-dimensional structure of the
amino-terminal repeat of mouse epithelial cadherin. Unexpected
structural similarities with the immunoglobulin fold suggested an
evolutionary relation between the calcium-dependent cadherin cell
adhesion molecules and the calcium-independent immunoglobulin cell
adhesion molecules.

Boggon et al. (2002) presented the 3.1-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of the whole, functional extracellular domain from C-cadherin,
a representative classical cadherin from Xenopus. The structure
suggested a molecular mechanism for adhesion between cells by classical
cadherins, and it provided a new framework for understanding both
same-cell (cis) and juxtaposed-cell (trans) cadherin interactions.

Al-Amoudi et al. (2007) applied cryoelectron tomography of vitreous
sections from human epidermis to visualize the 3-dimensional molecular
architecture of desmosomal cadherins at close-to-native conditions. The
3-dimensional reconstructions showed a regular array of densities at
approximately 70-angstrom intervals along the midline, with a curved
shape resembling the x-ray structure of C-cadherin, a representative
classical cadherin. Model-independent 3-dimensional image processing of
extracted subtomograms revealed the cadherin organization. After fitting
the C-cadherin atomic structure into the averaged subtomograms,
Al-Amoudi et al. (2007) saw a periodic arrangement of a trans W-like and
a cis V-like interaction corresponding to molecules from opposing
membranes and the same cell membrane, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Cano et al. (2000) found that transcription of mouse E-cadherin is under
the control of Snail (SNAI1; 604238), a strong repressor that
specifically interacts with the mouse E-cadherin promoter. By in situ
hybridization of early mouse embryos undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal
transitions, they found expression of E-cadherin to be inversely
correlated with expression of Snai1. Cano et al. (2000) found strong
evidence that abnormal expression of SNAI1 could also underlie the
tumorigenic conversion of epithelia associated with the loss of
E-cadherin expression. In a screen of several mouse cell lines, they
detected high expression of Snai1 mRNA, and low expression of E-cadherin
mRNA, in cell types that are highly invasive and metastatic, whereas the
opposite pattern was found in noninvasive epithelial cell lines. They
found the same inverse correlation between SNAI1 and E-cadherin
expression in human carcinoma cell lines of various etiologies, as well
as in primary human tumors undergoing malignant progression. Only a
human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cell line, which downregulates
E-cadherin through hypermethylation of the E-cadherin promoter, did not
show high SNAI1 expression. By transfection experiments with several
epithelial cell lines, Cano et al. (2000) found that Snai1
overexpression leads to a dramatic conversion to a fibroblastic
phenotype at the same time that E-cadherin expression is lost and
tumorigenic and invasive properties are acquired.

Batlle et al. (2000) found the identical inverse pattern of Snai1 and
E-cadherin expression by Northern blot analysis of a panel of epithelial
tumor cell lines. Likewise, they also found that exogenous expression of
SNAI1 downregulates E-cadherin mRNA. In addition, Batlle et al. (2000)
found that reduction in SNAI1 levels by transfection of antisense SNAI1
promotes a significant restoration of E-cadherin mRNA and protein.
Through mutation analysis and gel retardation assays, Batlle et al.
(2000) found that the 3 E-boxes contained in the promoter region of
E-cadherin cooperate in SNAI1-mediated E-cadherin repression.

Using retroviral transduction, Palmer et al. (2004) generated human
SW480-ADH colon cancer cells that ectopically express mouse
hemagglutinin-tagged protein (SNAIL-HA). Overexpression of Snai1 in
these cells resulted in lower vitamin D receptor (VDR; 601769) mRNA and
protein expression and inhibited induction of E-cadherin and VDR by
1,25(OH)2D3. A 1,25(OH)2D3 analog inhibited tumor growth in
immunodeficient mice injected with mock cells, but not in those injected
with SNAIL-HA cells. In 32 paired samples of normal colon and tumor
tissue from patients undergoing colorectal surgery, Palmer et al. (2004)
found that high SNAI1 expression in tumor tissue correlated with
downregulation of VDR and E-cadherin (p = 0.007 and 0.0073,
respectively). Palmer et al. (2004) concluded that the balance between
VDR and SNAI1 expression is critical for E-cadherin expression, which
influences cell fate during colon cancer progression.

Jamal and Schneider (2002) found downregulation of E-cadherin and
associated catenin proteins in human melanocytes and melanoma cells
following ultraviolet induction of endothelin-1 (EDN1; 131240) through
the type B endothelin receptor (EDNRB; 131244). Downregulation of
E-cadherin through this pathway involved the downstream activation of
caspase-8 (601763), but not the distal executioner caspases, and it did
not lead to apoptosis. EDN1 also induced a transient association between
caspase-8 and E-cadherin/beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) complexes. Jamal
and Schneider (2002) concluded that inhibition of E-cadherin through
this pathway would tend to promote melanoma invasion.

Listeria monocytogenes is the etiologic agent of listeriosis, a severe
human food-borne infection characterized by bacterial dissemination to
the central nervous system and the fetoplacental unit, due to its
capacity to cross the intestinal barrier, the blood-brain barrier, and
the fetoplacental barrier (Lorber, 1997). An important feature of this
bacterium is its ability to induce its own internalization into cells
that normally are nonphagocytic, such as epithelial cells. Internalin A
(InlA) and InlB, 2 leucine-rich repeat invasion proteins that have been
characterized in detail, mediate entry into different cell types. Human
E-cadherin promotes entry of Listeria monocytogenes into mammalian cells
by interacting with the bacterial surface protein InlA. Lecuit et al.
(1999) showed that mouse E-cadherin, although very similar to human
E-cadherin (85% identical), is not a receptor for internalin. By a
series of domain-swapping and mutagenesis experiments, they identified
pro16 of E-cadherin as a residue critical for specificity: a pro-to-glu
substitution in human E-cadherin totally abrogated interaction, whereas
a glu-to-pro substitution in mouse E-cadherin resulted in a complete
gain of function. A correlation between cell permissivity and the nature
of residue 16 in E-cadherins from several species was established. The
location of this key specificity residue in a region of E-cadherin not
involved in cell-cell adhesion and the stringency of the interaction
demonstrated by Lecuit et al. (1999) have important consequences not
only for the understanding of internalin function but also for the
choice of the animal model to be used to study human listeriosis: mouse,
albeit previously widely used, and rat appear as inappropriate animal
models to study all aspects of human listeriosis, as opposed to guinea
pig, which stands as a small animal of choice for future in vivo
studies.

E-cadherin also has a role in food-borne infection with Listeria
monocytogenes. This pathogen expresses a surface protein, internalin,
that interacts with the host receptor, E-cadherin, to promote entry into
human epithelial cells. Murine E-cadherin, in contrast to guinea pig
E-cadherin, does not interact with internalin, excluding the mouse as a
model for addressing internalin function in vivo. Lecuit et al. (2001)
demonstrated that in guinea pigs and transgenic mice expressing human
E-cadherin, internalin mediates invasion of enterocytes and crossing of
the intestinal barrier.

Kawasaki et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of ASEF (605216)
decreases E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and promotes the
migration of epithelial canine kidney cells. Both of these activities
were stimulated by truncated APC (611731) proteins expressed in
colorectal tumor cells. Experiments based on RNA interference and
dominant-negative mutants showed that both ASEF and mutated APC are
required for the migration of colorectal tumor cells expressing
truncated APC. Kawasaki et al. (2003) concluded that the APC-ASEF
complex functions in cell migration as well as in E-cadherin-mediated
cell-cell adhesion, and that truncated APC present in colorectal tumor
cells contributes to their aberrant migratory properties.

The morphogenesis of organs as diverse as lungs, teeth, and hair
follicles is initiated by a downgrowth from a layer of epithelial stem
cells. During follicular morphogenesis, stem cells form this bud
structure by changing their polarity and cell-cell contact. Jamora et
al. (2003) showed that this process is achieved through simultaneous
receipt of 2 external signals: a WNT protein (WNT3A; 606359) to
stabilize beta-catenin, and a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor
(Noggin; 602991) to produce Lef1 (153245). Beta-catenin binds to and
activates Lef1 transcription complexes that appear to act
uncharacteristically by downregulating the gene encoding E-cadherin, an
important component of polarity and intercellular adhesion. When either
signal is missing, functional Lef1 complexes are not made, and
E-cadherin downregulation and follicle morphogenesis are impaired. In
Drosophila, E-cadherin can influence the plane of cell division and
cytoskeletal dynamics. Consistent with this notion, Jamora et al. (2003)
showed that forced elevation of E-cadherin levels block invagination and
follicle production. Jamora et al. (2003) concluded that their findings
reveal an intricate molecular program that links 2 extracellular
signaling pathways to the formation of a nuclear transcription factor
that acts on target genes to remodel cellular junctions and permit
follicle formation.

Kawasaki and Taira (2004) presented evidence that short interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) targeted to CpG islands of an E-cadherin promoter induced DNA
and histone methylation and repressed transcription of the E-cadherin
gene. A retraction was published.

Hayashi and Carthew (2004) investigated the physical basis of biologic
patterning of the Drosophila retina in vivo. They demonstrated that
E-cadherin and N-cadherin (CDH2; 114020) mediate apical adhesion between
retina and epithelia cells. Differential expression of N-cadherin within
a subgroup of retinal cells (cone cells) caused them to form an overall
shape that minimized their surface contact with surrounding cells. The
cells within this group, in both normal and experimentally manipulated
conditions, packed together in the same way as soap bubbles do. The
shaping of cone cell group and packing of its components precisely
imitated the physical tendency for surfaces to be minimized. Hayashi and
Carthew (2004) concluded that simple patterned expression of N-cadherin
resulted in a complex spatial pattern of cells owing to cellular surface
mechanics.

Ino et al. (2002) demonstrated that dysadherin (606669)
posttranslationally downregulates E-cadherin, the prime mediator of
cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells. Sato et al. (2003) demonstrated
that dysadherin expression was significantly negatively correlated with
E-cadherin expression in thyroid carcinomas.

Full-length membrane-bound E-cadherin is cleaved in the extracellular
domain by a metalloprotease, generating a 38-kD C-terminal fragment,
which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity into a
soluble 33-kD C-terminal fragment. Using a panel of mouse embryonic
fibroblasts deficient in various metalloproteases, Maretzky et al.
(2005) found that those cells deficient in Adam10 (602192) showed
reduced generation of the E-cadherin 38-kD C-terminal fragment. They
further found that Adam10 was responsible for both constitutive and
regulated E-cadherin shedding in mouse fibroblasts and keratinocytes.
Adam10-mediated E-cadherin shedding affected epithelial cell-cell
adhesion as well as cell migration, and it modulated beta-catenin
subcellular localization and downstream signaling.

Pena et al. (2005) studied the expression and functional correlation of
the SNAI1, CDH1, vitamin D receptor (VDR; 601769), and ZEB1 (189909)
genes and examined their possible involvement in colon cancer. Their
expression was measured by real-time PCR in 114 patients with colorectal
cancer, and tumor characteristics were analyzed in each patient. SNAI1
expression was associated with downregulation of CDH1 (P = less than
0.001) and VDR (P = less than 0.001) gene products. There was a positive
correlation between CDH1 and VDR expressions, but the association
between SNAI1 and CDH1 was not found in patients with high expression of
ZEB1. There was a correlation between downregulation of: (a) ZEB1 and
presence of polyps in surgical resections; (b) VDR and poor
differentiation; and (c) CDH1 and poor differentiation, vascular
invasion, presence of lymph node metastases and advanced stages; as well
as a trend toward a correlation between SNAI1 expression in tumors and
vascular invasion. Pena et al. (2005) suggested analyzing these genes in
colon cancer patients for prognostic purposes and for predicting
response to possible therapies with vitamin D or its analogs.

Frebourg et al. (2006) found that in human embryos CDH1 is highly
expressed at 4 and 5 weeks in the frontonasal prominence and at 6 weeks
in the lateral and medial nasal prominences, and is therefore expressed
during critical stages of lip and palate development. These results were
in agreement with those obtained by Montenegro et al. (2000) in mouse
embryos by immunohistochemistry. Frebourg et al. (2006) also found that
at most time points examined CDH1 expression varied with that of PVRL1
(600644), mutations in which cause autosomal recessive clefting
syndromes with ectodermal dysplasia (see 225060).

By in silico analysis, Place et al. (2008) identified putative miR373
(MIRN373; 611954) target sites in the promoter regions of the E-cadherin
and cold shock domain-containing C2 (CSDC2) genes. Transfection of
miR373 and its precursor hairpin into PC-3 human prostate carcinoma
cells induced expression of E-cadherin and CSDC2. Knockdown experiments
confirmed that induction of E-cadherin by pre-miR373 required the
miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer (606241). Enrichment of RNA polymerase II
(see 180660) was detected at both E-cadherin and CSDC3 promoters after
miR373 transfection. Induction of E-cadherin and CSDC2 by miR373 was not
observed in several other human cell lines of different tissue origins,
indicating that miR373 differentially activates target genes in
different cell lines.

Cavey et al. (2008) focused on Drosophila homophilic E-cadherin
complexes rather than total E-cadherin, including diffusing 'free'
E-cadherin, because these complexes are a better proxy for adhesion.
They found that E-cadherin complexes partition in very stable
microdomains (i.e., bona fide adhesive foci, which are more stable than
remodeling contacts). Stability and mobility of these microdomains was
dependent on 2 actin populations: small stable actin patches
concentrated at homophilic E-cadherin clusters and a dynamic contractile
actin network that constrains homophilic E-cadherin clusters lateral
movement by a tethering mechanism. Alpha-catenin controls epithelial
architecture mainly through regulation of the mobility of homophilic
E-cadherin clusters and was largely dispensable for their stability.
Uncoupling stability and mobility of E-cadherin complexes suggested that
stable epithelia may remodel through the regulated mobility of very
stable adhesive foci.

Among 48 primary ovarian cancer (167000) tumors and corresponding
metastases, Blechschmidt et al. (2008) found a significant association
(p = 0.008) between reduced E-cadherin expression in the primary cancer
tissue and shorter overall survival. Patients with decreased E-cadherin
expression and increased SNAIL expression in the primary tumor showed a
higher risk of death (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in
expression of E-cadherin or SNAIL between primary tumors and metastases.
The findings were consistent with a role for E-cadherin and SNAIL in the
behavior of metastatic cancer.

Pinho et al. (2009) demonstrated that wildtype E-cadherin regulated
MGAT3 (604621) gene transcription, resulting in increased
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) expression. GnT-III and
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V, or MGAT5, 601774)
competitively modified E-cadherin N-glycans. RNAi-knockdown of GnT-III
in MCF-7/AZ cells revealed membrane delocalization of E-cadherin leading
to its cytoplasmic accumulation. Further, GnT-III knockdown in cells
also caused modifications of E-cadherin N-glycans catalyzed by GnT-III
and GnT-V. Pinho et al. (2009) proposed a bidirectional crosstalk
between E-cadherin and GnT-III/GnT-V, which may influence tumor
progression and metastasis.

Banh et al. (2009) showed that the first 2 extracellular domains of
N-cadherin interacted with the inhibitory receptor KLRG1 (604874),
blocked interaction of KLRG1 with E-cadherin, and could regulate KLRG1
signaling. Binding of KLRG1 to E-cadherin inhibited E-cadherin-dependent
cell adhesion and led to tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin. The
KLRG1/E-cadherin interaction led to the generation of a bidirectional
signal in which both KLRG1 and E-cadherin activated downstream signaling
cascades simultaneously, regulating cells expressing one or the other
molecule.

Maitre et al. (2012) showed that cell adhesion and cortex tension have
different mechanical functions in controlling progenitor cell-cell
contact formation and sorting during zebrafish gastrulation. Cortex
tension controls cell-cell contact expansion by modulating interfacial
tension at the contact. By contrast, adhesion has little direct function
in contact expansion, but instead is needed to mechanically couple the
cortices of adhering cells at their contacts, allowing cortex tension to
control contact expansion. The coupling function of adhesion is mediated
by E-cadherin and limited by the mechanical anchoring of E-cadherin to
the cortex. Thus, Maitre et al. (2012) concluded that cell adhesion
provides the mechanical scaffold for cell cortex tension to drive cell
sorting during gastrulation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations

Reduced expression of E-cadherin is regarded as one of the main
molecular events involved in dysfunction of the cell-cell adhesion
system, triggering cancer invasion and metastasis. Becker et al. (1994)
suggested that E-cadherin mutations contribute to the histopathologic
appearance of stomach cancer because 13 of 26 diffuse gastric carcinomas
(137215), which have reduced homophilic cell-to-cell interactions, had
abnormal gene transcripts that were not seen in noncancerous tissue from
the same patients, indicating a somatic origin.

Oda et al. (1994) analyzed 10 human cancer cell lines that showed growth
characterized morphologically by loose cell-cell adhesion for possible
structural abnormalities in the expressed E-cadherin. Strong mRNA and
protein expression with no nucleotide sequence abnormalities was found
in 4 cell lines, and mRNA was absent in 4 other cell lines. In the
remaining 2 gastric carcinoma cell lines, the mRNA sequence was
abnormal. One showed a 12-bp in-frame deletion with strong expression of
mRNA and protein. In the other, there were 4 mRNA species with
insertions of different sizes, among which the major transcripts (with a
7-bp insertion) caused a frameshift, and expression of both mRNA and
protein were markedly reduced. In these 2 cell lines, DNA mutations were
detected around exon-intron junctions, revealing that aberrant RNA
splicing was the cause of the mRNA abnormalities. In addition, the
wildtype allele of the E-cadherin locus was lost, suggesting that the
E-cadherin gene had been inactivated by 2 hits (mutation and allele
loss), similar to the mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor
genes.

Risinger et al. (1994) identified somatic mutations in the CDH1 gene
(see, e.g., 192090.0001-192090.0003) in carcinomas of the endometrium
(608089) and ovary (167000). Two tumors had retention of the wildtype
alleles, and 2 had somatic loss of heterozygosity in the tumor tissue.
The findings were consistent with CDH1 acting as a tumor suppressor
gene.

To investigate the molecular basis of altered CDH1 expression in cancer,
Berx et al. (1995) performed a PCR/SSCP mutation screen of the CDH1 gene
in 49 breast cancer patients. No relevant DNA changes were encountered
in any of 42 infiltrative ductal or medullary breast carcinoma samples.
In contrast, 4 of 7 infiltrative lobular breast carcinomas (see 137215)
harbored protein truncation mutations (3 nonsense and 1 frameshift) in
the extracellular part of the E-cadherin protein (e.g., 192090.0004).
Each of the 4 lobular carcinomas with E-cadherin mutations showed
tumor-specific loss of heterozygosity of chromosomal region 16q22.1
containing the E-cadherin locus, thus supporting the Knudson 2-hit
hypothesis. Berx et al. (1995) detected no E-cadherin expression in
these 4 tumors by immunohistochemistry.

Ilyas et al. (1997) concluded that mutations in CDH1 do not account for
decreased E-cadherin protein expression in colorectal tumors. They found
no association between either CDH1 allele loss or exon 16 replication
errors and low levels of CDH1 protein expression in 54 sporadic
colorectal cancers (114500) and 14 ulcerative colitis-associated
colorectal cancers. The authors had postulated that CDH1 gene mutation
or allele loss would affect E-cadherin's function as a suppressor of
tumor invasion.

Berx et al. (1998) found reports of 69 somatic mutations of the CDH1
gene. These comprised, in addition to a few missense mutations, mainly
splice site mutations and truncation mutations caused by insertions,
deletions, and nonsense mutations. There was a major difference in
mutation type between diffuse gastric and infiltrative lobular breast
cancers. In diffuse gastric tumors, the predominant defects were exon
skippings, which caused in-frame deletions. By contrast, most mutations
found in infiltrating lobular breast cancers were out-of-frame
mutations, which were predicted to yield secreted truncated E-cadherin
fragments. In most cases these mutations occurred in combination with
loss of heterozygosity.

Wheeler et al. (2002) examined the possible contribution of E-cadherin
to sporadic small intestinal adenocarcinoma. E-cadherin protein
expression was assessed immunohistochemically in a total of 21
nonfamilial, nonampullary small intestinal adenocarcinomas. Eight tumors
(38%) had decreased protein expression at the cell membrane, a finding
in common with colorectal carcinomas (Ilyas et al., 1997). This led the
authors to suggest that mutation or promoter hypermethylation in the
E-cadherin gene may play an important role in the pathogenesis of
sporadic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

Deplazes et al. (2009) demonstrated that E-cadherin harboring an
in-frame deletion of exon 8 had reduced ability to activate Rac1
(602048) and to inhibit Rho (165390). The lack of Rac1 activation
influenced the downstream signaling of Rac1, as shown by a decrease in
the binding of the Rac1 effector protein IQGAP1 (603379) to Rac1-GTP.
Reduced membranous localization of p120-catenin (CTNND1; 601045) in
mutant E-cadherin expressing cells was associated with the lack of
negative regulation of Rho by mutant E-cadherin. The enhanced motility
and invasion associated with mutant E-cadherin was sensitive to the
inhibition of Rac1 and Rho. Deplazes et al. (2009) concluded that the
mutation of E-cadherin had a reciprocal influence on Rac1 and Rho
activation, and that Rac1 and Rho are involved in the establishment of
the migratory and invasive phenotype of tumor cells harboring an
E-cadherin mutation.

- Germline Mutations in Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer
and Lobular Breast Cancer

Striking examples of dominantly inherited predisposition to gastric
cancer (including Napoleon Bonaparte's family) have been reported
(Sokoloff, 1938). In addition, a number of dominantly inherited familial
cancer syndromes are characterized by gastric cancer susceptibility.
Guilford et al. (1998) reported heterozygous germline mutations in the
CDH1 gene (192090.0005-192090.0007) in 3 kindreds of Maori origin from
New Zealand with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC; 137215).

Richards et al. (1999) analyzed 8 UK kindreds with hereditary diffuse
gastric cancer and identified novel germline CDH1 mutations (192090.0008
and 192090.0009) in 2 families. Both mutations were predicted to
truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain. In 1
family, there was evidence of nonpenetrance and susceptibility to both
gastric and colorectal cancer; thus, in addition to 6 cases of gastric
cancer, a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30
years. Gayther et al. (1998) also described germline CDH1 mutations in
familial gastric cancer. Yoon et al. (1999) screened 5 Korean patients
with familial gastric cancer for germline mutations in the CDH1 gene and
identified 2 with missense mutations.

To extend earlier observations of germline CDH1 mutations in kindreds
with an inherited susceptibility to diffuse gastric cancer, Guilford et
al. (1999) sought germline mutations in the CDH1 gene in 5 further
families affected predominantly by diffuse gastric cancer and in 1
family with a history of diffuse gastric cancer and early-onset breast
cancer. Heterozygous inactivating mutations were found in the CDH1 gene
in each of these 6 families. No mutation hotspots were identified.

Aberrant promoter methylation and the associated loss of gene expression
is a common finding in human cancers. Nevertheless, it had been
difficult to demonstrate that methylation of a specific gene was causal
in any given tumor and not a consequence of the malignant
transformation. Grady et al. (2000) noted that patients with
heterozygous germline mutations in the CDH1 gene develop gastric cancer,
but their cancers consistently demonstrate no loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) at the CDH1 locus. They hypothesized that methylation of the CDH1
promoter might represent the 'second genetic hit' in the genesis of
these tumors. The CDH1 promoter was found to be consistently
unmethylated in normal stomach mucosa, whereas 3 of 6 HDGC tumors with
negative CDH1 staining had aberrant CDH1 promoter methylation. Two
tumors that had retained unmethylated CDH1 promoters harbored somatic
CDH1 mutations. No somatic mutations were found in 2 HDGC tumors showing
CDH1 promoter methylation, but sequence polymorphisms confirmed that
they retained a second wildtype allele. These findings indicated that
the formation of HDGC tumors requires biallelic CDH1 inactivation, which
in one-half of cases is accomplished by promoter methylation of a
retained wildtype allele. Grady et al. (2000) pointed to examples of
promoter methylation identified in sporadic cancers in which promoter
methylation of the CDKN2A (600160) and RB1 (614041) genes had been
noted, as well as in some renal tumors in patients with von
Hippel-Lindau disease (193300).

Oliveira et al. (2002) performed germline CDH1 mutation screening in 39
kindreds with familial aggregation of gastric cancer, a subset of which
fulfilled the criteria defined by the International Gastric Cancer
Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. CDH1
germline mutations were detected in 4 of 11 (36.4%) HDGC families. No
mutations were identified in 63.6% of HDGC families or in kindreds with
familial aggregation of gastric cancer not fulfilling criteria for HDGC.
These results added support to the evidence that only HDGC families
harbor germline mutations in CDH1 and that genes other than CDH1
remained to be identified.

Humar et al. (2002) performed a germline mutation search in 10 gastric
cancer families, 7 of which met the clinical criteria for HDGC. They
identified germline mutations in 4 of the 7 families and in 1 family
that was borderline for the clinical criteria. Of the mutations
identified in the 5 families, 4 were previously unreported.

Suriano et al. (2003) screened a series of 66 young (diagnosed before
age 50) gastric cancer probands for germline CDH1 mutations and
identified 2 missense alterations: A617T (192090.0002) and A634V
(192090.0015). Stably transfected cadherin-negative CHO cell lines were
characterized in terms of aggregation, invasion, and motility. Cells
expressing either the A634V or thr340-to-ala (T340A; 192090.0016)
mutation failed to aggregate, showed invasive behavior, and migrated
abnormally compared to wildtype cells in vitro. Cells expressing the
A617T mutation displayed an intermediate ability to aggregate.

Suriano et al. (2003) characterized the effect of CDH1 germline missense
mutations on the morphology, motility, and proliferation of transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells. Wildtype E-cadherin and A617T-expressing
cells had an epithelial-like morphology, with polarized cells migrating
unidirectionally. T340A- and A634V-expressing cells had a high-motility
fibroblast-like phenotype, which was dependent on an increased level of
active RhoA (165390). Val832-to-met (V832M; 192090.0017)-expressing
cells grew in a piled-up structure of round cells, resulting from
disturbance of binding between alpha-catenin (CTNNA1; 116805) and
beta-catenin, and destabilization of the adhesion complex was shown to
hamper the motile capabilities of these cells. CDH1 mutations showed no
effect on cell proliferation. Suriano et al. (2003) concluded that the
ability of cells expressing CDH1 mutations to invade is independent of
their motile capabilities, providing evidence that motility is neither
necessary nor sufficient for cells to invade.

Brooks-Wilson et al. (2004) ascertained 43 apparent cases of hereditary
gastric cancer and screened them for germline CDH1 mutations. The
authors identified heterozygosity in 10 different families for 10
loss-of-function mutations, including 2 insertions, 5 deletions, 2
splice-site substitutions, and 1 complex deletion/insertion involving a
splice site. They also found 3 heterozygous missense mutations which
were predicted to affect conserved residues and to have deleterious
effects on protein function. Brooks-Wilson et al. (2004) noted that
there were multiple cases of breast cancers, including pathologically
confirmed lobular breast cancer (see 137215), in both mutation-positive
and -negative families.

Masciari et al. (2007) identified a germline mutation in the CDH1 gene
(192090.0021) in a woman who developed lobular breast cancer at age 42
years. The breast cancer was negative for E-cadherin by immunostaining,
and further analysis detected loss of heterozygosity of part of the
gene. The patient's mother reportedly developed lobular breast cancer at
age 28. No other breast or gastric cancers were reported in the family.

Simoes-Correia et al. (2008) analyzed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells
stably expressing the germline E-cadherin R749W and E757K mutations,
which are associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (137215),
and observed an abnormal pattern of E-cadherin expression, with protein
accumulating mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The authors
demonstrated that E-cadherin missense mutants are subject to ER quality
control (ERQC) and undergo ER-associated degradation; treatment of these
mutant cells with specific chemical chaperones restored E-cadherin to
the cell membrane and rescued its function. Simoes-Correia et al. (2008)
concluded that ERQC plays a major role in E-cadherin regulation.

Oliveira et al. (2009) reported 6 (6.5%) of 93 previously described
mutation-negative hereditary diffuse gastric cancer probands who carried
genomic deletions (see, e.g., 192090.0022 and 192090.0023) in the CDH1
gene. The statistically significant overrepresentation of Alu repeats
around the breakpoints indicated nonallelic homologous recombination of
Alu repeats as a likely mechanism for these deletions. When all
mutations and deletions were considered, the overall frequency of CDH1
alterations in HDGC was approximately 46% (73 of 160), and large CDH1
deletions occurred in 3.8% of HDGC families.

- Other Disease Associations

Jonsson et al. (2004) demonstrated an association between the -160C/A
promoter polymorphism of CDH1 (192090.0018) and risk of hereditary
prostate cancer.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Frebourg et al. (2006) reported the association of CDH1 mutations with
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (119530) in 2 families with
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. In each family, the CDH1 mutation was
a splicing mutation generating aberrant transcripts with an in-frame
deletion, removing the extracellular cadherin repeat domains involved in
cell-cell adhesion. Such transcripts might encode mutant proteins with
trans-dominant-negative effects. Expression of CDH1 in human embryos
during critical stages of lip and palate development suggested that
alteration of the E-cadherin pathway may contribute to human clefting.
The development of diffuse gastric cancer in CDH1 mutation carriers
requires the somatic inactivation of the wildtype allele (Grady et al.,
2000; Oliveira et al., 2004), as predicted by the Knudson 2-hit model.

ANIMAL MODEL

Riethmacher et al. (1995) introduced a targeted mutation into the
E-cadherin gene by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem
cells. The mutation removed E-cadherin sequences essential for Ca(2+)
binding and for adhesive function. These embryonic stem cells were used
to generate mice carrying the mutation. Heterozygous mutant animals
appeared normal and were fertile. However, the homozygous mutation was
not compatible with life; the homozygous embryos showed severe
abnormalities before implantation. Particularly, the adhesive cells of
the morula dissociated shortly after compaction had occurred, and their
morphologic polarization was then destroyed.

Development of malignant tumors is in part characterized by the ability
of a tumor cell to overcome cell-cell adhesion and to invade surrounding
tissue. E-cadherin, the main adhesion molecule of epithelia, has been
implicated in carcinogenesis because it is frequently lost in human
epithelial cancers. Reestablishing the functional cadherin complex in
tumor cell lines results in reversion from an invasive to a benign
epithelial phenotype. Perl et al. (1998) found that loss of E-cadherin
expression coincides with the transition from well-differentiated
adenoma to invasive carcinoma in a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic
beta-cell carcinogenesis. Intercrossing model mice with transgenic mice
that maintained E-cadherin expression in beta-tumor cells resulted in
arrest of tumor development at the adenoma stage, whereas expression of
a dominant-negative form of E-cadherin induced early invasion and
metastasis. The results demonstrated that loss of E-cadherin-mediated
cell adhesion is a rate-limiting step in the progression from adenoma to
carcinoma and is a cause of that progression, not a consequence.

HISTORY

The liver cell adhesion molecule is a primary cell adhesion molecule
that appears in a distinct pattern at a variety of inductive embryonic
sites as well as in adult tissues. It was initially isolated on the
basis of its ability to mediate calcium-dependent adhesion between cells
of the chicken liver epithelium. Gallin et al. (1987) isolated and
determined the nucleic acid sequence of a cDNA clone encoding chicken
LCAM. The predicted sequence of the protein supported an earlier
conclusion that LCAM is an intrinsic membrane protein. Its sequence was
not homologous to other known protein sequences, including those of the
neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM; 116930) and other members of the
immunoglobulin superfamily. It was not certain that the liver cell
adhesion molecule of the chicken is different from calcium-dependent
adhesion molecules, including uvomorulin and E-cadherin, which have been
isolated from different epithelial tissues or cell lines in mammals;
these molecules have biochemical properties and tissue distributions so
similar to those of LCAM that it is likely that all of them are its
mammalian homologs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
CDH1, LEU711VAL

In an endometrial carcinoma (608089), Risinger et al. (1994) identified
a somatic C-to-G transversion in the CDH1 gene, resulting in a
leu711-to-val (L711V) substitution. The wildtype allele was not lost.

CDH1, ALA617THR

In an endometrial carcinoma (608089), Risinger et al. (1994) identified
a somatic G-to-A transition in the CDH1 gene, resulting in an
ala617-to-thr (A617T) substitution. Somatic loss of heterozygosity was
identified in the tumor tissue.

Suriano et al. (2003) detected a heterozygous germline A617T mutation in
2 African American female patients with diffuse gastric cancer (137215).
The authors observed that CHO cells expressing the A617T mutation
displayed decreased cell-to-cell aggregation.

.0003
OVARIAN CANCER, SOMATIC
CDH1, SER838GLY

In ovarian carcinoma tissue (167000), Risinger et al. (1994) identified
a somatic A-to-G transition in codon 838 of the CDH1 gene, resulting in
a ser838-to-gly (S838G) substitution. The tumor tissue showed somatic
loss of heterozygosity.

.0004
BREAST CANCER, LOBULAR, SOMATIC
CDH1, GLU261TER

In an infiltrative lobular breast carcinoma (see 137215), Berx et al.
(1995) found a somatic GAA (glu)-to-TAA (stop) nonsense mutation (E261X)
in the CDH1 gene. Tumor-specific loss of heterozygosity of chromosomal
region 16q22.1 was demonstrated in this case.

.0005
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, 1008G-T

In affected members of a Maori family from New Zealand with early-onset
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (137215) originally reported by Jones
(1964), Guilford et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous 1008G-T
transversion in the CDH1 gene. The G-to-T transversion was in the last
nucleotide (position 1008) of exon 7, which is part of the donor splice
consensus sequence. RT-PCR studies showed that the mutation resulted in
a 7-bp insertion derived from the intronic sequence between the normal
splice donor site and an adjacent cryptic splice site, and was predicted
to generate a premature stop codon in exon 8 of the CDH1 gene. The
cryptic splicing of the 1008T transcript occurred with high efficiency;
only 1 of 20 clones derived from the normal 180-bp PCR product contained
the 1008T mutation. Alternatively, the G-to-A transversion could have
resulted in a glu336-to-asp (E336D) substitution, which could have had
important effects on the correct functioning of the protein. In this
family, the age of death from gastric cancer ranged upward from 14
years, with the majority of cases occurring in people under the age of
40. The pedigree pattern was consistent with dominant inheritance of a
susceptibility gene with incomplete penetrance. The presence of a
somatic mutation at position 1008 of the CDH1 gene had been reported in
a sporadic case of histologically diffuse gastric carcinoma (Oda et al.,
1994).

.0006
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, 1-BP INS, 2382C

Guilford et al. (1998) described a family in which multiple members with
diffuse gastric cancer (137215) were heterozygous for the insertion of
an additional C residue in a run of 5 cytosines at positions 2382 to
2386. The resulting frameshift led to an E-cadherin molecule lacking
about half of its cytoplasmic domain. The gastric cancer was of the
early-onset, histologically diffuse type.

.0007
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, GLN699TER

In a family with early-onset, histologically diffuse gastric cancer
(137215), Guilford et al. (1998) found that the 30-year-old proband was
heterozygous for a 2095C-T transition in the CDH1 gene, resulting in a
gln699-to-ter (Q699X) substitution. The mutation was predicted to result
in an E-cadherin peptide lacking both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic
domains.

CDH1, IVS1AS, A-G, -2

In a family from the U.K. in which 6 members had gastric cancer
(137215), Richards et al. (1999) identified a splice acceptor site
mutation, an A-to-G transition at position -2 from nucleotide 49 at the
start of exon 2 of the CDH1 gene. In addition to the 6 members with
gastric cancer, 1 member of the family developed adenocarcinoma of the
rectum at the age of 30 years.

GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, TRP20TER

In a family from the U.K. with 3 cases of gastric cancer (137215) in
successive generations, diagnosed at ages 27, 50, and 38 years, Richards
et al. (1999) identified a germline G-to-A transition at nucleotide 59
in exon 2 of the CDH1 gene, resulting in a trp20-to-ter (W20X)
substitution. The mutation was predicted to truncate the E-cadherin gene
product in the signal peptide domain, which is cleaved from the N
terminus of the mature protein.

CDH1, GLU24TER

In a family in which multiple members had diffuse gastric cancer
(137215), Guilford et al. (1999) identified a heterozygous G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 70 in exon 2 of the CDH1 gene, resulting in a
glu24-to-ter (Q24X) substitution in the signal peptide of the E-cadherin
precursor protein. Lynch et al. (2000) described E-cadherin
mutation-based genetic counseling in this kindred. Of 24 family members
tested for the 70G-T mutation, 9 were found to be positive and 15
negative. None of the 19 patients counseled wanted results sent to their
physicians once they recognized the potential for insurance
discrimination. None had undergone endoscopic ultrasound. Three who were
positive for the mutation expressed strong interest in prophylactic
gastrectomy. Three of the 9 who tested positive were affected and had
died by the time of report.

CDH1, ARG598TER

In a family segregating diffuse gastric cancer (137215), Gayther et al.
(1998) found a 2095C-T transition in the CDH1 gene, resulting in an
arg598-to-ter (R598X) substitution. The family was subsequently studied
from the point of view of genetic screening, surgical management, and
pathologic findings by Huntsman et al. (2001).

.0013

CDH1, 1-BP INS, 1711G

Gayther et al. (1998) found a 1-bp insertion in the CDH1 gene in the
proband of a family with familial diffuse gastric cancer (137215).
Insertion of a G after nucleotide 1711 created a frameshift predicted to
truncate the protein at codon 587. The family was subsequently studied
from the point of view of genetic screening, surgical management, and
pathologic findings by Huntsman et al. (2001).

.0014
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, 1-BP INS, 1588C

In a family segregating diffuse gastric cancer (137215), Guilford et al.
(1999) identified a 1-bp insertion (1588insC) in exon 11 of the CDH1
gene. Chun et al. (2001) reported total gastrectomy as a prophylactic
intervention in all 5 affected members of a family with diffuse gastric
cancer and the 1588insC mutation.

.0015
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, ALA634VAL

In a Portuguese adult male with diffuse hereditary signet ring gastric
carcinoma (137215), Suriano et al. (2003) identified a 1901C-T
transition in exon 12 of the CDH1 gene, which was predicted to result in
an ala634-to-val (A634V) substitution. Cells transfected with this
mutant cDNA exhibited decreased aggregation, increased invasiveness, and
nonuniform migration in vitro compared to cells transfected with
wildtype cDNA.

.0016
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, THR340ALA

In a kindred of European origin with gastric cancer (137215), Oliveira
et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous 1018A-G transition in exon 8 of
the CDH1 gene, resulting in a thr340-to-ala (T340A) substitution.

Suriano et al. (2003) observed that CHO cells expressing the T340A
mutation failed to aggregate, showed invasive behavior, and migrated
abnormally compared to wildtype cells in vitro.

.0017
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, VAL832MET

In a Japanese family with diffuse gastric cancer (137215), Yabuta et al.
(2002) identified heterozygosity for a 2494G-A transition in exon 16 of
the CDH1 gene, resulting in a val832-to-met (V832M) substitution.

.0018
PROSTATE CANCER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
CDH1, -160C-A (dbSNP rs16260)

Jonsson et al. (2004) genotyped 1,036 patients with sporadic, familial
(2 close relatives), or hereditary (3 or more close relatives) prostate
cancer (176807) and 669 controls for the -160C/A promoter polymorphism
(dbSNP rs16260). The risk of hereditary prostate cancer was increased
among CA carriers (odds ratio = 1.7) and AA carriers (odds ratio = 2.6)
compared to controls; genotype frequencies did not differ between
sporadic or familial cases and controls. Jonsson et al. (2004) concluded
that CDH1 is a low-penetrant prostate cancer susceptibility gene that
might explain a proportion of familial and particularly hereditary
prostate cancer.

In an independent replication study population consisting of 612
patients with sporadic prostate cancer and 211 patients with at least 2
relatives with prostate cancer in a nuclear family (so-called 'FH+'
cases) and 540 controls, Lindstrom et al. (2005) found strong evidence
of an association between the -160C-A promoter polymorphism and risk of
prostate cancer (p = 0.003) when comparing FH+ cases and controls. In
the total study population, CA and AA carriers had an increased risk
compared to CC carriers (odds ratio = 1.5 and 2.6, respectively). No
significant difference in genotype frequency was observed between
sporadic cases and controls.

CDH1, IVS4DS, T-A, +2

Frebourg et al. (2006) described a Caucasian family in which 4 members
had diffuse gastric cancer and cleft lip/palate (see 137215) and 2 other
individuals had gastric cancer without clefting. Affected members of the
family were shown to have a mutation of the intron 4 splicing donor site
(531+2T-A). RT-PCR analysis of CDH1 from peripheral blood lymphocytes
and sequence analysis of the amplified cDNA demonstrated that this
mutation induced complex aberrant splicing including activation of an
exonic cryptic donor splicing site.

.0020
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE, AND CLEFT LIP WITH OR WITHOUT

CDH1, 1137G-A

Frebourg et al. (2006) found a splicing mutation affecting the last
nucleotide of exon 8 of the CDH1 gene (1137G-A) in a man with hereditary
diffuse gastric cancer (137215), his 2 daughters with gastric cancer, a
daughter with cleft lip but no gastric cancer at age 25, and in a
16-year-old son who had congenital aplasia cutis of the scalp and
partial acrania (107600) but no known gastric cancer.

.0021
BREAST CANCER, LOBULAR
CDH1, 1-BP INS, 517A

In the germline of a woman who developed lobular breast cancer (see
137215) at age 42 years, Masciari et al. (2007) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp insertion (517insA) in the CDH1 gene, resulting in
truncation of the extracellular portion of the protein. The breast
cancer was negative for E-cadherin by immunostaining, and further
analysis detected loss of heterozygosity of part of the gene. The
patient's mother reportedly developed lobular breast cancer at age 28.
No other breast or gastric cancers were reported in the family.

GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, 193.6-KB DEL, EX1-2

In 2 probands, one northern European and the other Canadian, with
diffuse gastric cancer (137215), who were both negative for germline
CDH1 point mutations, Oliveira et al. (2009) identified the same
193.6-kb germline deletion involving the entire CDH3 gene (114021) and
exons 1 and 2 of the CDH1 gene. The northern European proband, who also
had lobular breast cancer, had 2 children and a grandchild diagnosed
with diffuse gastric cancer at the age of 40, 37, and 28, respectively.
Affected family members were not tested for the deletion. The Canadian
proband developed diffuse gastric cancer at age 38 and again at age 43,
and had 2 sisters who also developed diffuse gastric cancer at age 30
and 35, respectively, but they were not tested for the deletion.
Haplotype analysis of microsatellite markers surround the CDH1 gene
indicated that the 2 probands shared a 9-marker haplotype, demonstrating
the existence of a common ancestor carrying the deletion.

.0023
GASTRIC CANCER, HEREDITARY DIFFUSE
CDH1, 828-BP DEL/3-BP INS, EX16

In a European proband with diffuse gastric cancer (137215) who was
negative for germline CDH1 point mutations, Oliveira et al. (2009)
identified an 828-bp deletion/3-bp insertion in the CDH1 gene. The
deletion affected exon 16. The proband's mother had died of gastric
cancer of unconfirmed histology as had 2 relatives, and 2 other
relatives had died of diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer.
The proband's 2 sisters were diagnosed with diffuse gastric cancer, and
1 was tested for the deletion and proved to be a carrier as had her 2
asymptomatic children.

;;PLATELET GLYCOPROTEIN Ib, BETA POLYPEPTIDE;;
GP Ib, BETA SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycoprotein Ib (GP Ib) is a platelet surface membrane glycoprotein that
functions as a receptor for von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160). The
main portion of the receptor is a heterodimer composed of 2 polypeptide
chains, an alpha chain (GP1BA; 606672) and a beta chain, that are linked
by disulfide bonds. The GP1BB gene encodes the beta subunit. The
complete receptor complex includes noncovalent association of the alpha
and beta subunits with platelet glycoprotein IX (GP9; 173515) and
platelet glycoprotein V (GP5; 173511) (review by Lopez et al., 1998).

CLONING

By screening a cDNA library prepared from human erythroleukemia cells
(HEL), Lopez et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA for the beta subunit of GP
Ib. The cDNA encodes a deduced 181-amino acid protein with a molecular
mass of 22 kD. A 1-kb mRNA was detected. The beta chain contains a
single 24-amino acid leucine-rich sequence; leucine-rich sequences are
also present in the GP Ib alpha subunit, the GP IX protein, and the GP V
protein. There is a 25-amino acid transmembrane segment and a 34-amino
acid intracellular segment. The intracellular segment contains 2
potential phosphorylation sites.

Using HEL cell-derived GP1BB cDNA as a probe, Kelly et al. (1994)
detected 2 mRNA species by Northern blot analysis: a 3.5-kb species in
endothelial cells and a 1.1-kb species in HEL cells. Kelly et al. (1994)
cloned and sequenced the endothelial cell cDNA and found that it encodes
a 411-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD.
Expression of the gene was most abundant in heart and brain. The authors
concluded that the 2 mRNA species resulted from alternative expression
of the GP1BB gene in different cells.

Roth (1994), who referred to the endothelial transcript as neo-Ib-beta,
commented that this may be the first example of a nonviral gene product
being formed by starting transcription well upstream and by including a
'former' intron in the transcript. Such use of an alternative promoter
and alternative splicing of a transcript are well-known mechanisms for
generating new but related products. However, these mechanisms in
combination with a shift in reading frame and translation from a
promoter, 5-prime UTR, and intron had probably been familiar previously
only to virologists. The mechanism results in production of a new and
apparently useful protein by extending and modifying a genomic template.

Zieger et al. (1997) noted that the 206-amino acid precursor of GP
Ib-beta is synthesized from a 1.0-kb mRNA expressed by megakaryocytes,
but that a 3.5-kb transcript had been identified in other cell lines.
Zieger et al. (1997) studied the origin of the 3.5-kb transcript to
determine its relationship to the 1.0-kb mRNA. Cloning experiments
demonstrated that the longer transcript results from an imperfect
polyadenylation recognition sequence within a separate gene (SEPT9;
602724) located upstream to the platelet GP1BB gene. In the absence of
normal polyadenylation, the more 5-prime SEPT5 gene uses the
polyadenylation site within its 3-prime neighbor, the platelet GP1BB
gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelly et al. (1994) reported that the coding region of the GP1BB gene is
contained within 1 exon, similar to GP1BA, GP9, and GP5.

MAPPING

Using human/hamster somatic cell hybrids, Kelly et al. (1994) localized
the GP1BB gene to chromosome 22cen-q11.2. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Yagi et al. (1994) regionally assigned the GP1BB gene to
22q11.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Budarf et al. (1995) identified a patient with phenotypic features of
both Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS; 231200), a bleeding disorder, and
the velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS; 192430). Fluorescence in situ
hybridization studies demonstrated that the patient had a deletion in
22q11.2. The patient was thrombocytopenic and had abnormal bleeding
during cardiac catheterization at the age of 18 months and circumcision
at the age of 3 years. He also bruised easily and had episodes of
epistaxis. He had large platelets on smear and diminished platelet
aggregation response to ristocetin. Studies of the patient's platelets
revealed present but decreased GP Ib-alpha and completely absent GP
Ib-beta protein. Deletion of the DiGeorge chromosomal region, resulting
in a single copy of GP1BB, was not sufficient to cause BSS, as this was
the first report of this disorder in association with VCFS. In the
patient reported by Budarf et al. (1995), Ludlow et al. (1996)
identified a mutation in the upstream promoter of the GP1BB gene
(138720.0004). Thus, in this patient, BSS resulted from deletion of 1
copy of the gene and mutation in the other copy.

Kunishima et al. (1997) described missense mutations in the GP1BB gene
(138720.0001, 138720.0002) that impaired the GP Ib alpha/beta disulfide
linkage in a family with giant platelets.

Moran et al. (2000) identified a trp21-to-ter mutation (138720.0003) in
the GP1BB gene resulting in Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Studies of
transient coexpression of this mutant, together with wildtype GP1BA and
GP9, demonstrated a failure of GP9 expression on the surface of the
testing cells. Other studies indicated that GP1BB affected the surface
expression of the complex of the GP Ib-IX complex by failing to support
the insertion of GP Ib-alpha and GP IX into the platelet membrane.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kato et al. (2004) found that Gp1bb-null mice had macrothrombocytopenia
and a severe bleeding phenotype. Electron microscropy showed increased
size of the alpha-granules compared to control alpha-granules. Western
blot analysis showed overexpression of Sept5, a gene that resides
approximately 250 nucleotides 5-prime to the Gp1bb gene and has been
associated with modulating exocytosis from neurons and platelets as part
of a presynaptic protein complex. Increased Sept5 protein levels were
seen specifically in megakaryocytes and not in brain lysates of
Gp1bb-null mice. The authors suggested that deletion of a large portion
of the Gp1bb transcript in order to create the mouse model affected
expression of the neighboring Sept5 gene. The findings unexpectedly
implicated the SEPT5 gene in the maintenance of normal alpha-granule
size, perhaps by mediating vesicle fusion.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MACROTHROMBOCYTOPENIA, FAMILIAL, BERNARD-SOULIER TYPE
GP1BB, TYR88CYS

Kunishima et al. (1997) reported 2 Japanese sisters with a giant
platelet disorder that was not accompanied by thrombocytopenia or
leukocyte inclusions. During childhood, they experienced frequent
episodes of epistaxis, but thereafter the tendency to bleed settled.
Platelets from the index patient did not aggregate with ristocetin, and
she had a prolonged bleeding time (9.5 minutes, normal range 2-5
minutes). Immunoblot analysis under nonreduced conditions showed that
most of the GP Ib-alpha in the patient's platelets was not disulfide
linked with GP Ib-beta. DNA sequencing showed compound heterozygosity
for 2 independent missense mutations in the GP1BB gene: from tyr (TAC)
to cys (TGC) at residue 88, and from ala (GCC) to pro (CCC) at residue
108 (138720.0002). These mutations were thought to result in decreased
expression of the GP Ib/IX complex and to influence the association of
the complex with the membrane skeleton, consequently impairing normal
platelet morphology. The authors suggested that the phenotype caused by
mutations in the subunits of the GP Ib/IX complex could span the
spectrum from a normal phenotype, to isolated giant platelet disorder,
to a full-blown bleeding disorder such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome
(231200).

BERNARD SOULIER SYNDROME, TYPE B
GP1BB, TRP21TER

In a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (231200), Moran et al. (2000)
found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 159 of the GP1BB gene, resulting
in a premature termination of translation at amino acid trp21. The
patient was a 57-year-old Irish man with a severe bleeding diathesis.
The diagnosis of BSS was based on the presence of thrombocytopenia,
large platelets on peripheral blood smear, and a profuse bleeding
tendency requiring transfusion. Bleeding occurred both spontaneously and
after minor surgical procedures. The spontaneous bleeding apparently
stopped when the patient was about 20 years of age, but the
thrombocytopenia persisted. The patient's bleeding time was longer than
15 minutes. The patient's parents were first cousins and had no history
of abnormal bleeding. The mutation was present in homozygous form. Moran
et al. (2000) stated that this was the first report of homozygosity for
a mutation in the GP1BB gene.

.0004
BERNARD SOULIER SYNDROME, TYPE B
GP1BB, C-G, -133

In patient reported by Budarf et al. (1995) with Bernard-Soulier
syndrome (231200), velocardiofacial syndrome (192430), and a deletion in
chromosome 22q, Ludlow et al. (1996) identified a C-G transition at
position -133 in the 5-prime upstream region of the GP1BB gene,
resulting in disruption of a GATA consensus binding sequence and a
decrease in promoter activity. Thus, in this patient, BSS resulted from
deletion of 1 copy of the gene and mutation in the other copy.

179710	TITLE *179710 REGULATOR OF CHROMOSOME CONDENSATION 1; RCC1
;;CHROMOSOME CONDENSATION 1; CHC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mitotic cells possess chromosome-condensing factor(s), the presence of
which is shown by fusing mitotic and interphase cells. Upon fusion, the
chromatin is condensed and exhibits various forms of prematurely
condensed chromosomes (PCCs), depending on the phase of the cell. The
condensation process is essential for the even distribution of genetic
material into daughter cells. On the other hand, transcription cannot
occur from the mitotically condensed chromosomes. Cells obviously must
have regulatory mechanisms that allow condensation of the chromatin to
occur at a precisely correct time in the cell cycle. In the normal cell
cycle, the chromosome-condensing factor(s) appears in the early G2 phase
and accumulates toward the mitotic phase. Mutations associated with this
step in the cell cycle have to be isolated as temperature-sensitive
mutants (Kai et al., 1986). Ohtsubo et al. (1987) cloned the human RCC1
gene after DNA-mediated gene transfer into a temperature-sensitive
mutant which shows premature chromosome condensation at nonpermissive
temperatures (39.5-40 degrees C). This gene codes for a 2.5-kb
polyadenylated RNA that is well conserved in hamsters and humans.
Ohtsubo et al. (1987) found 2 cDNA clones in a human library that
complemented the temperature-sensitive mutation with an efficiency
comparable to that of the genomic DNA clone. The clones appeared to
encode a protein of 421 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight
of 44,847.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furuno et al. (1991) isolated total genomic DNA for the human RCC1 gene
from HeLa cells and determined its complete nucleotide sequence (34,641
bp) by the shotgun sequencing method. The gene was found to have 14
exons, 8 of which (starting from the seventh one) coded the 7 repeated
sequences of RCC1 protein. A single exon corresponded roughly to each
repeat of the RCC1 protein except for the middle one, indicating that
the RCC1 gene was generated through amplification of a primordial exon.
Primer extension analysis demonstrated the presence of an internal
promoter.

MAPPING

By hybridization to DNA from sorted chromosomes, Ohtsubo et al. (1987)
concluded that the gene, which they symbolized RCC1, is located on
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a
suppression FISH method for elimination of repetitive sequences in the
genomic clone, Nishimoto et al. (1994) mapped the CHC1 gene to 1p36.1.
They reported work of others indicating that the mouse counterpart maps
to the distal region of chromosome 4.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Makde et al. (2010) determined the crystal structure of a complex of
Drosophila RCC1 and the nucleosome core particle at 2.9-angstrom
resolution, providing an atomic view of how a chromatin protein
interacts with the histone and DNA components of the nucleosome. Their
structure also suggested that the Widom 601 DNA positioning sequence
present in the nucleosomes forms a 145-bp nucleosome core particle, not
the expected canonical 147-bp particle.

GENE FUNCTION

Bischoff et al. (1990) demonstrated that RCC1 protein is homologous to a
47-kD nuclear protein recognized by antikinetochore autoimmune sera from
patients with CREST syndrome (181750).

Hayashi et al. (1995) showed that, both in mammalian cells and in yeast,
RANBP1 (601180) acts as a negative regulator of RCC1 by inhibiting
RCC1-stimulated guanine nucleotide release from RAN (601179). See also
601181.

Ohba et al. (1999) demonstrated that the nucleotide exchange activity of
RCC1, the only known nucleotide exchange factor for RAN, was required
for microtubule aster formation with or without demembranated sperm in
Xenopus egg extracts arrested in meiosis II. In the RCC1-depleted egg
extracts, RanGTP (see 602362), but not RanGDP, induced self-organization
of microtubule asters, and the process required the activity of dynein
(see 603297). Thus, RAN was shown to regulate formation of the
microtubule network.

Adding chromatin beads to Xenopus egg extracts causes nucleation of
microtubules, which eventually reorganize into a bipolar spindle. Using
this assay, Carazo-Salas et al. (1999) demonstrated that the activity of
chromosome-associated RCC1 protein is required for spindle formation.
When in the GTP-bound state (RanGTP), RAN itself induces microtubule
nucleation and spindle-like structures in M-phase extract. Carazo-Salas
et al. (1999) proposed that RCC1 generates a high local concentration of
RanGTP around chromatin which, in turn, induces the local nucleation of
microtubules.

The Ran GTPase (601179) controls nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic
spindle formation, and nuclear envelope assembly. These functions rely
on the association of the Ran-specific exchange factor, RCC1, with
chromatin. Nemergut et al. (2001) found that RCC1 binds directly to
mononucleosomes and to histones H2A and H2B (142711). RCC1 utilizes
these histones to bind Xenopus sperm chromatin, and the binding of RCC1
to nucleosomes or histones stimulates the catalytic activity of RCC1.
Nemergut et al. (2001) proposed that the docking of RCC1 to H2A/H2B
establishes the polarity of the Ran-GTP gradient that drives nuclear
envelope assembly, nuclear transport, and other nuclear events.

Li and Zheng (2004) provided evidence that CDC2 (116940) coordinates
spindle assembly with the cell cycle during mitosis through
phosphorylation of RCC1. CDC2 phosphorylates RCC1 on serines located in
or near its nuclear localization signal. This phosphorylation activates
RCC1 to generate RanGTP on mitotic chromosomes, which is required for
spindle assembly and chromosome segregation.

At the time of the report of Schaner Tooley et al. (2010), the RAN
guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 was the only protein for which
any biologic function of alpha-N-methylation had been identified.
Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 have reduced affinity for DNA (Hao
and Macara, 2008) and cause mitotic defects (Chen et al., 2007), but
further characterization of this modification had been hindered by
ignorance of the responsible methyltransferase. Schaner Tooley et al.
(2010) reported the discovery of the first alpha-N-methyltransferase,
which they named N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase (NRMT; 613560).
Substrate docking and mutational analysis of RCC1 defined the NRMT
recognition sequence and enabled the identification of numerous
methylation targets, including SET (600960) and RB1 (614041). Knockdown
of NRMT recapitulated the multispindle phenotype seen with
methylation-defective RCC1 mutants, demonstrating the importance of
alpha-N-methylation for normal bipolar spindle formation and chromosome
segregation.

NOMENCLATURE

RCC1 was used by HGM workshops for the primary renal cell carcinoma
locus on 3p (144700). CHC1 is another symbol for this locus (McAlpine,
1988).

602207	TITLE *602207 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB18; RAB18
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rab proteins are members of a family of Ras-related small GTPases that
regulate membrane trafficking in organelles and transport vesicles.

CLONING

By stimulating umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with histamine
and differential display gene expression analysis, Schafer et al. (2000)
isolated a cDNA encoding RAB18. The deduced 206-amino acid protein
shares 98%, 92%, and 85% identity with the mouse, snail, and worm
sequences, respectively. RAB18 contains totally conserved
phosphate/Mg(2+)-binding motifs and guanine-binding motifs as well as
somewhat variable organelle-targeting regions. Northern blot analysis
detected 2.5- and 1.0-kb transcripts in endothelial cells but not in
smooth muscle cells or leukocytes. RT-PCR analysis suggested ubiquitous
expression, which HPLC analysis determined to be strongest in heart,
kidney, pancreas, lung, and liver, with weak expression in brain,
placenta, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Schafer et al. (2000) reported that stimulation of polarized HUVEC or
nonpolarized mononuclear cells with histamine showed a significant time-
and dose-dependent increase of RAB18 transcript in both cell types,
suggesting a possible role for Rab proteins in inflammation.

MAPPING

McMurtrie et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Rab18 gene to chromosome 18.

Hartz (2009) mapped the RAB18 gene to chromosome 10p12.1 based on an
alignment of the RAB18 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AA216667) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 5 large consanguineous families, 4 Pakistani and
1 Turkish, segregating Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM3; 614222), Bem et
al. (2011) identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the RAB18
gene (602207.0001 and 602207.0002, respectively). Direct sequencing for
RAB18 mutations in 58 additional families segregating Warburg Micro
syndrome detected compound heterozygous mutations
(602207.0003-602207.0004) in affected sibs of 1 family. Bem et al.
(2011) performed nucleotide-binding assays and showed that although
RAB18 bound GDP and GTP comparably to other RABs (RAB5A, 179512; RAB35,
604199), the RAB18 L24Q (602207.0001) and R93del (602207.0003) mutant
proteins did not bind detectable levels of either GDP or GTP and are
therefore functionally null. Bem et al. (2011) noted that the
pathogenicity of these mutations could be explained by their lack of
guanosine nucleotide binding because, as for other RAB proteins, this is
a prerequisite for correct subcellular localization and function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bem et al. (2011) investigated the effect of knockdown of rab18 in
zebrafish to establish whether rab18 has a conserved role in brain and
eye development. The most common abnormalities observed at 3 days
post-fertilization in both the rab18a and rab18b morphants were
microphthalmia, microcephaly, pericardial edema, delayed jaw formation,
a reduced overall body size, and a general developmental delay. Further
characterization of the rab18b eye phenotype revealed that the rab18b
morphants had delayed retinal development and abnormal retinal
lamination, residual nucleated lens fiber cells, widely open choroid
fissure, and microphthalmia at day 3. To assess the specificity of the
rab18b phenotype, Bem et al. (2011) conducted a rescue experiment by
synthesizing rab18b mRNA. Partial rescue of the eye defects, pericardial
edema, and overall developmental delay was observed at 3 days.

In affected members of a family segregating Warburg Micro syndrome-3

in the RAB18 gene: a 3-bp deletion (277_279del) resulting in deletion of
arginine-93 (R93del), and an antitermination mutation, a 619T-C
transition resulting in a ter207-to-gln (X207Q; 602207.0004)
substitution, predicted to extend RAB18 by 20 amino acids (X207QextX20)
and thus abolish C-terminal prenylation and membrane targeting.

605176	TITLE *605176 HYDROXYACID OXIDASE 2; HAO2
;;HAOX2;;
HYDROXYACID OXIDASE, LONG-CHAIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

2-Hydroxyacid oxidases can oxidize a broad range of 2-hydroxyacids,
ranging from glycolate to long-chain 2-hydroxy fatty acids such as
2-hydroxypalmitate. These enzymes utilize a flavin cofactor and convert
2-hydroxyacids to 2-ketoacids with the concomitant reduction of
molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide.

CLONING

The plant glycolate oxidase (GOX; EC 1.1.3.15), which has an essential
role in photorespiration, is a prototypic 2-hydroxyacid oxidase. By
searching an EST database for human cDNAs capable of encoding proteins
with sequence similarity to spinach GOX, Jones et al. (2000) identified
HAO1 (605023) and HAO2; they stated in an erratum that the cDNA they had
identified as human HAO3 (HAOX3) actually belonged to mouse. The
predicted 351-amino acid HAO2 protein, which the authors called HAOX2,
terminates in the consensus type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1)
serine-arginine-leucine. Indirect immunofluorescence indicated that HAO2
localizes to the peroxisome. HAO2 shares 46.7% amino acid sequence
identity identity with spinach GOX and 46.0% identity with HAO1.
Recombinant HAO2 had 2-hydroxyacid oxidase activity, with highest
activity toward 2-hydroxypalmitate. Northern blot analysis of 16 human
tissues detected an approximately 2.0-kb HAO2 transcript at high levels
in both liver and kidney, and at a low level in thymus.

MAPPING

Jones et al. (2000) noted that a region of the HAO2 gene corresponds to
an STS on chromosome 1.

UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2R 1; UBE2R1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Normal eukaryotes from yeasts to humans have a conserved checkpoint
mechanism in cell division for maintenance of genomic stability. After
DNA strand breaks, checkpoint genes induce rest in the G1 and G2 phases
of the cell cycle until the damage is repaired. Plon et al. (1993)
isolated a putative human G2 checkpoint gene, a homolog of the CDC34
gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Human CDC34 could substitute
efficiently for yeast CDC34.

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, Semplici et
al. (2002) demonstrated that CK2 (see 115440) phosphorylated CDC34 and
UBC3B (UBE2R2; 612506) at a corresponding serine residue in the C
terminus of each protein. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that
phosphorylated UBC3B and CDC34 bound specifically to the F-box protein
beta-TRCP (BTRC; 603482), which resulted in enhanced degradation of
beta-catenin (116806), a substrate of BTRC. Semplici et al. (2002)
suggested that CK2-dependent phosphorylation of CDC34 and UBC3B
functions by regulating BTRC substrate recognition.

Pierce et al. (2009) developed a quantitative framework based on product
distribution that predicted that the really interesting new gene (RING)
E3 enzymes SCF(Cdc4) (606278) and SCF-beta-TrCP (603482) work with the
E2 Cdc34 to build polyubiquitin chains on substrates by sequential
transfers of single ubiquitins. Measurements with millisecond time
resolution directly demonstrated that substrate polyubiquitylation
proceeds sequentially. Pierce et al. (2009) concluded that their results
presented an unprecedented glimpse into the mechanism of RING ubiquitin
ligases and illuminated the quantitative parameters that underlie the
rate and pattern of ubiquitin chain assembly.

MAPPING

Plon et al. (1993) demonstrated by in situ hybridization that the CDC34
gene is located in the far telomeric region of 19p13.3, in a region of
syntenic homology between human 19p and mouse 11.

612031	TITLE *612031 INHIBIN, BETA E; INHBE
ACTIVIN BETA-E, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INHBE is a member of the activin beta family (see INHBA; 147290) that
plays a role in pancreatic exocrine cell growth and proliferation
(Hashimoto et al., 2006).

CLONING

By degenerative PCR of a human liver cDNA library, followed by 5-prime
and 3-prime PCR, Hashimoto et al. (2002) cloned INHBE, which they called
activin beta-E subunit. The deduced 350-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide and a potential N-glycosylation
site. The proposed cleavage site at amino acids 232 to 236 would yield a
mature 114-amino acid protein. INHBE shares 97% and 96% similarity with
the mouse and rat activin beta-E orthologs, respectively. The deduced
mature human beta-E subunit shares amino acid identity of 44%, 48%, and
64% with activin beta-A (INHBA; 147290), activin beta-B (INHBB; 147390),
and activin beta-C (INHBC; 601233), respectively. Northern blot analysis
of human tissues detected a 2.7-kb transcript with strong expression in
liver and weak expression in heart, testis, peripheral blood leukocyte,
placenta, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Hashimoto et al. (2002) suggested that INHBE forms a homodimer based on
identification of a 33-kD band under nonreducing conditions and a lower
size with reducing conditions. GST pull-down assays showed that INHBE
binds follistatin (FST; 136470).

The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) causes ER stress and induces the unfolded protein
response (UPR), a coordinated series of cellular events that increases
the capacity of the ER to process the unfolded proteins and reduce the
protein loads. Using microarray analysis, Dombroski et al. (2010) found
that VLDLR (192977) and INHBE were among hundreds of genes upregulated
by ER stress in immortalized human B cell lines. Their expression was
also induced by ER stress in primary human fibroblasts, and the
expression of VLDLR was induced by ER stress in keratinocytes, which do
not express INHBE. The expression of many genes showed individual
variation; however, both INHBE and VLDLR were consistently upregulated
by ER stress in all 60 immortalized B cell lines examined.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hashimoto et al. (2006) showed that transgenic mice overexpressing human
INHBE exhibited decreased pancreas size with hypoplasia of pancreatic
exocrine cells, suggesting that INHBE plays a role in inhibiting growth
and proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells.

;;Neu5Ac-9-PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE HALOACID DEHALOGENASE-LIKE HYDROLASE
DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN-4; HDHD4
DESCRIPTION Neu5Ac-9-phosphate phosphatase (Neu5Ac-9-Pase; EC 3.1.3.29)
dephosphorylates Neu5Ac-9-phosphate to form N-acetylneuraminate
(Neu5Ac), the main form of sialic acid in vertebrates that has important
roles in protein-protein and cell-cell recognition.

CLONING

Maliekal et al. (2006) purified Neu5Ac-9-Pase from rat liver and
isolated the phosphatase activity. Using SDS-PAGE analysis and tandem
mass spectrometry, they identified a haloacid dehalogenase-like
hydrolase domain containing-4 (HDHD4) protein. Purified recombinant
human HDHD4 catalyzed the dephosphorylation of Neu5Ac-9-phosphate with a
catalytic efficiency more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than for any
other substrate tested. The 248-amino acid human HDHD4 protein has 3
motifs found in phosphatases of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family:
the first with 2 extremely conserved aspartates, the second comprising a
conserved serine or threonine, and the third comprising a conserved
lysine and 2 conserved aspartates.

GENE STRUCTURE

Maliekal et al. (2006) determined that the human HDHD4 gene contains 2
exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Maliekal et al. (2006) determined that the phosphatase activity of human
Neu5Ac-9-Pase protein was dependent on the presence of Mg(2+) and was
inhibited by vanadate and Ca(2+), which is characteristic of members of
the HAD family of phosphatases.

MAPPING

Maliekal et al. (2006) mapped the human NANP gene to chromosome 20p11 by
alignment with mapped sequences.

;;HSP60;;
CHAPERONIN, 60-KD; CPN60;;
GroEL, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

It had long been assumed that all information necessary for proper
folding of proteins and their assembly into oligomeric complexes was
contained within the primary sequence of the polypeptides and that no
catalyst or other accessory proteins were involved in this process.
However, this basic tenet of biochemistry was challenged by the
discovery of chaperonins, which are involved in the folding and assembly
of a number of different proteins (Cheng et al., 1989; Ellis, 1990;
Rothman, 1989). Members of the chaperonin family include the GroEL
protein of E. coli and HSP60, a protein present in eukaryotic cell
mitochondria. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, synthesis of
these proteins is induced in response to stresses, such as heat shock
(Venner et al., 1990).

CLONING

Venner et al. (1990) presented evidence of the existence of multiple
copies of the HSP60 gene in the human. All except one of these genes are
nonfunctional pseudogenes containing numerous changes such as base
substitutions, insertions, and deletions.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Azem et al. (1994) performed chemical crosslinking and electron
microscopy studies on bacterial chaperonins GroEL and GroES (HSPE1;
600141) to determine how they interact with unfolded proteins. GroEL is
an oligomer of 14 identical 57.3-kD subunits, with a structure of 2
stacked heptameric rings arranged around a 2-fold axis of symmetry
(Saibil et al., 1991). It appears as a hollow cylinder. In the presence
of ATP, 2 GroES rings (each made of 7 identical 10.4-kD subunits) can
successively bind a single GroEL core to make a functional symmetric
heterodimer. Although the central core of GroEL is obstructed by the 2
GroES rings at each end, this heterodimer can stably bind and assist the
refolding of the RuBisCo enzyme. While binding was thought to occur in
the central cavity, these data indicate that unfolded proteins may bind
and fold on the external envelope of some chaperonins (Azem et al.,
1994). Schmidt et al. (1994) suggested that the symmetric chaperonin
complex is functionally significant because complete folding of a
nonnative substrate protein in the presence of GroEL and GroES occurs
only in the presence of ATP, and not with ADP. Chaperonin-assisted
folding occurs by a catalytic cycle in which one ATP is hydrolyzed by
one ring of GroEL in a quantized manner with each turnover. Todd et al.
(1994) proposed a unifying model for chaperonin-facilitated protein
folding based on successive rounds of binding and release, and
partitioning between committed and kinetically trapped intermediates.

GENE FUNCTION

Zal et al. (2004) examined the antigen recognition of CD4
(186940)-positive/CD28 (186760)-null T lymphocytes from 21 patients with
acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 12 with chronic stable angina, and 9
healthy controls. CD4-positive/CD28-null cells from 12 of 21 patients
with ACS reacted with HSPD1; no response was detected to human
cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or oxidized LDL.
CD4-positive/CD28-null cells from patients with chronic stable angina
and controls did not react to any of the antigens. Zal et al. (2004)
concluded that HSPD1 is an antigen recognized by CD4-positive/CD28-null
T cells of patients with acute coronary syndrome and suggested that
HSPD1-specific CD4-positive/CD28-null cells may contribute to vascular
damage in these patients.

Zanin-Zhorov et al. (2006) reported that HSP60, as well as a synthetic
peptide derived from HSP60 (p227), acted as a costimulator of human
regulatory CD4-positive/CD25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive T cells (Tregs),
which inhibit lymphoproliferation and IFNG (147570) and TNF (191160)
secretion by CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells. HSP60 enhanced Treg
activity via TLR2 (603028), leading to activation of an intracellular
signaling cascade that included p38 (MAPK14; 600289), as well as
inhibition of ERK (see MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation. Suppression of
target T cells was mediated by both cell-to-cell contact and by
secretion of TGFB (190180) and IL10 (124092), and it led to
downregulation of ERK, NFKB (see 164011), and TBET (TBX21; 604895)
expression. Zanin-Zhorov et al. (2006) concluded that the self-molecule
HSP60 can downregulate adaptive immune responses by upregulating Tregs
through TLR2 signaling.

Using a luciferase-reporter assay, Hansen et al. (2003) demonstrated
that the region between the HSP60 and HSP10 (600141) genes functions as
a bidirectional promoter.

Tokuriki and Tawfik (2009) examined the ability of the E. coli
GroEL/GroES (HSP10) chaperonins to buffer destabilizing and adaptive
mutations. Mutational drifts performed in vitro with 4 different enzymes
indicated the GroEL/GroES overexpression doubled the number of
accumulating mutations, and promoted the folding of enzyme variants
carrying mutations in the protein core and/or mutations with higher
destabilizing effects. The divergence of modified enzymatic specificity
occurred much faster under GroEL/GroES overexpression, in terms of the
number of adapted variants (greater than or equal to 2-fold) and their
improved specificity and activity (greater than or equal to 10-fold).
Tokuriki and Tawfik (2009) concluded that protein stability is a major
constraint in protein evolution, and that buffering mechanisms such as
chaperonins are key in alleviating this constraint.

GENE STRUCTURE

Venner et al. (1990) claimed that HSP60 is intronless. Hansen et al.
(2003) presented the full sequence of the HSP60 and HSP10 genes. They
found that both genes are linked head to head, comprising approximately
17 kb and consisting of 12 and 4 exons, respectively. The first exon of
HSP60 is noncoding, and the first exon of HSP10 ends with the start
codon.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (2003) mapped the HSP60 gene
between markers AFMA121YH1 and WI-10756 on chromosome 2. This
localization and the position of 2 homologous fragments in the human
genome assembly were consistent with the cytogenetic location 2q33.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) represents a clinically and
genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders that are
characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs.
Seventeen different loci had been mapped, and the corresponding genes
for 5 of these had been cloned and identified. Two of the 5 gene
products--paraplegin (SPG7; 602783) and spastin (SPG4; 182601)--feature
AAA+ domains and are predicted to possess chaperone activity. Paraplegin
is the human homolog of a yeast protease/chaperone that is involved in
mitochondrial protein quality control. The HSP60 gene maps to the same
region, namely 2q33.1, as does spastic paraplegia-13 (SPG13; 605280), as
determined by Fontaine et al. (2000). Speculating that the mitochondrial
chaperonin HSP60 or its co-chaperonin HSP10, which maps to the same
region, might be the site of mutation(s) causing SPG13, Hansen et al.
(2002) sequenced HSP60 in 2 affected members of the family with SPG13.
They found that both were heterozygous for a G-to-A variation at
position 292 of the HSP60 cDNA, resulting in the substitution of a
valine at position 72 in the mature HSP60 by isoleucine (V72I). Studies
in E. coli indicated that the V72I mutant protein is functionally
incapacitated. The authors suggested that SPG4, SPG7, and SPG13 can be
referred to as chaperonopathies.

By linkage studies, followed by candidate gene analysis, of a large
Israeli Bedouin family with autosomal recessive hypomyelinating
leukodystrophy (HLD4; 612233), Magen et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous mutation in the HSPD1 gene (118190.0002). The authors
suggested the designation 'MitCHAP60 disease.'

In a French family with autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia mapping to
2q33.1 (605280), Hansen et al. (2002) found a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 292 of the HSP60 cDNA, resulting in the substitution of a
valine residue at position 72 in the mature HSP60 with isoleucine (val72
to ile; V72I).

LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 4
HSPD1, ASP29GLY

In 10 affected members of a consanguineous Israeli Bedouin family with
autosomal recessive hypomelinating leukodystrophy (612233), Magen et al.
(2008) identified homozygosity for a genomic 1512A-G transition in exon
2 of the HSPD1 gene, resulting in an asp29-to-gly (D29G) substitution in
a highly conserved residue adjacent to the first 26 N-terminal residues
composing the mitochondrial matrix targeting sequence. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that transfection with the mutant
protein impaired cell growth that worsened with increasing temperature.
Common clinical features included infantile-onset rotary nystagmus,
progressive spastic paraplegia, neurologic regression, motor impairment,
profound mental retardation, and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. Death
usually occurred within the first 2 decades of life. Heterozygous
carriers were unaffected.

611661	TITLE *611661 DBF4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, B; DBF4B
;;DBF4-RELATED FACTOR 1; DRF1;;
ASK-LIKE 1; ASKL1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DBF4B forms a kinase complex with CDC7 (CDC7L1; 603311) and may play a
role in cell-cycle progression (Montagnoli et al., 2002;
Yoshizawa-Sugata et al., 2005).

CLONING

By database analysis using human DBF4 (604281) as probe, Montagnoli et
al. (2002) identified DBF4B, which they called DRF1. The deduced
615-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 67.2 kD and
contains conserved N, M, and C motifs and a bipartite nuclear
localization signal. Northern blot analysis detected high expression in
testis and in all tumor cells analyzed with the exception of A549 small
cell lung carcinoma. Low DBF4B expression was detected in all other
tissues examined. Immunofluorescence studies localized DBF4B to the
nucleus with exclusion from the nucleolus in transfected HeLa cells.

Yoshizawa-Sugata et al. (2005) identified 4 distinct transcripts of
DBF4B, which they called ASKL1. They reported that DBF4B shares 25%
amino acid identity with DBF4 and localized DBF4B to the nuclear soluble
fraction throughout the cell cycle. ASKL1a corresponded to the
full-length DBF4B transcript identified by Montagnoli et al. (2002).
ASKL1b comprised 576 amino acids and lacked the M motif, and ASKL1d
comprised 242 amino acids and lacked the M and C motifs. Both
transcripts did not form a complex with CDC7. ASKL1c comprised 448 amino
acids, contained the conserved N, M, and C motifs, and formed a complex
with CDC7.

GENE FUNCTION

By GST pull-down assay and coimmunoprecipitation studies, Montagnoli et
al. (2002) showed that DBF4B interacted with CDC7 (CDC7L1; 603311). The
DBF4B-CDC7 protein complex displayed an in vitro kinase activity with a
substrate preference for MCM2 (116945) and DBF4B itself was a substrate
for CDC7. Kinase activity was not detected in CDC7 alone or in a protein
complex containing a kinase-dead CDC7 mutant and DBF4B.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DBF4B and DBF4 binding to CDC7
was mutually exclusive, with no formation of ternary complexes. FACS
analysis of synchronized cells and Northern blot analysis of
serum-starved stimulated cells demonstrated that both DBF4B mRNA and
protein expression fluctuated during the cell cycle, with low DBF4B mRNA
levels in the G0 arrested and G1 cells and increased mRNA accumulation
at the G1/S border. Western blot analysis detected an increase in DBF4B
levels after release from thymidine block and decrease when most of the
cells left mitosis, with kinetics similar to that observed for cyclin A
(CCNA2; 123835). By transfection into HeLa cells, followed by
cyclohexamide treatment, Montagnoli et al. (2002) showed that DBF4B has
a relatively short half-life of less than 1.5 hours.

Yoshizawa-Sugata et al. (2005) determined that DBF4B protein levels
varied during the cell cycle and increased at late S to G2/M phase;
siRNA knockdown of DBF4B expression in HeLa cells slowed cell growth, as
measured by reduced cell counts. FACS analysis showed that siRNA
knockdown of DBF4B decreased G1 cells and increased late S to G2/M phase
cells. The population of mitotic cells increased in both CDC7 and DBF4B
siRNA-treated cells. DBF4B knockdown slowed mitotic progression and
inhibited release from mitosis. Using specific antibodies to detect
double-stranded DNA breaks in DBF4B-depleted cells, Yoshizawa-Sugata et
al. (2005) found that DBF4B knockdown resulted in arrested replication
fork progression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Montagnoli et al. (2002) mapped the DBF4B
gene to chromosome 17q21.

134921	TITLE *134921 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 6; FGF6
;;HST2 ONCOGENE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a mouse cosmid library with a human HST (FGF4; 164980)
probe under reduced conditions of stringency, Marics et al. (1989)
isolated several positive clones, one of which was identified as a new
member of the fibroblast growth factor gene family. They subsequently
isolated and sequenced the gene, which they called FGF6. The deduced
amino acid sequence showed 70% identity with the HST gene product over
the C-terminal two-thirds of the putative protein. FGF6 is the same as
the HST2 oncogene, which was identified by its close homology to the
HST1 gene.

Iida et al. (1992) determined that the HST2 gene encodes a 198-amino
acid protein containing a signal peptide with the characteristics of a
heparin-binding growth factor. RNA blot analysis detected expression of
HST2 in human leukemia cell lines with platelet/megakaryocytic
differentiation potential.

Fiore et al. (2000) stated that expression of FGF6 is essentially
restricted to developing and adult skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Marics et al. (1989) showed that the cloned normal FGF6 gene transformed
mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts using both focus and tumorigenicity assays.

MAPPING

Marics et al. (1989) mapped FGF6 to 12p13 by in situ hybridization. The
mapping of HST2 to 12p13 and of HST1 to 11q13 is further evidence of the
homeology between these 2 human chromosomes. Studying 2 somatic cell
hybrids containing either the der(12) or the der(X) from a mesothelioma
with a translocation t(X;12)(q22;p13) as the only chromosomal change,
Aerssens et al. (1994) demonstrated that FGF6 lies distal to the 12p13
breakpoint and to VWF (613160).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fiore et al. (2000) found that Fgf6-null mice showed normal muscle
regeneration following chemical or crush injury. They concluded that
FGF6 is either not involved in muscle regeneration or that this role is
strictly compensated by other factors.

Neuhaus et al. (2003) stated that regeneration of skeletal muscles in
Fgf6 and Fgf6/mdx (see DMD, 300377) mutant mice was impaired. They found
that the combined loss of Fgf2 (134920) and Fgf6 led to severe
dystrophic changes in the musculature of mdx mice, with reduced
formation of new myotubes in regenerating muscle; there was no
significant reduction in the number of skeletal muscle satellite cells.
Fgf6 mutant myoblasts showed decreased migration ability when
transplanted into wildtype mice.

604344	TITLE *604344 MANNOSIDASE, ALPHA, CLASS 1A, MEMBER 1; MAN1A1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Man(9)-mannosidase (alpha-1,2-mannosidase 1A; EC 3.2.1.113) catalyzes
the removal of 3 distinct mannose residues from peptide-bound
Man(9)-GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharides. See MAN2A1 (154582) for general
information.

CLONING

Using an oligonucleotide probe derived from a pig liver
Man(9)-mannosidase-specific cDNA template, Bause et al. (1993) isolated
Man(9)-mannosidase from a human kidney cDNA library. The full-length
cDNA predicted a 625-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass
of 71 kD. Man(9)-mannosidase is a type II transmembrane protein with a
short cytoplasmic polypeptide tail, a single transmembrane domain acting
as a noncleavable signal sequence, a large luminal catalytic domain, and
3 potential N-glycosylation sites.

MAPPING

Tremblay et al. (1998) noted that the UniGene database places the MAN1A1
gene on human chromosome 6. The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping
Consortium mapped the MAN1A1 gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP STS-X74837).

602951	TITLE *602951 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 37, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ZFP37
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify putative transcription factors involved in chondrocyte
differentiation during human endochondral bone formation, Dreyer et al.
(1998) screened a human fetal cartilage-specific cDNA library with a
degenerate oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a conserved stretch of
8 amino acids from the zinc finger region of the Drosophila Kruppel gene
family of DNA-binding proteins. Using this strategy, they identified a
novel zinc finger gene, termed ZFP37, which corresponds to a putative
transcription factor containing 12 tandemly repeated zinc finger motifs
and a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. The KRAB domain appears to
function as a transcriptional repressor and is located in the amino
terminus, while the zinc finger repeats are positioned at the carboxy
terminus of ZFP37. The gene is expressed at low level as a 3.2-kb mRNA
in several tissues, including fetal human cartilage. Sequence comparison
demonstrated homology to the mouse Zfp37 gene.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Dreyer et al. (1998) mapped the ZFP37 gene to chromosome
9q32. The Zfp37 gene in mouse maps to chromosome 4 in a region of
syntenic homology to human 9q32. Based on the map location and
expression pattern of ZFP37, Dreyer et al. (1998) proposed it as a
candidate gene for the Nager type of acrofacial dysostosis (154400)
(Zori et al., 1993).

611207	TITLE *611207 DNAJ/HSP40 HOMOLOG, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 1; DNAJC1
;;HTJ1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to mouse Dnajc1, followed by PCR of a
liver cDNA library, Kroczynska et al. (2004) cloned human DNAJC1, which
they called HTJ1. The deduced 554-amino acid protein has an N-terminal
signal sequence, followed by a J domain, a transmembrane region, a
ribosome-binding domain, 2 SANT domains, and a C-terminal endoplasmic
reticulum retrieval signal.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Kroczynska et al. (2004) found that DNAJC1
interacted with alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT; 107280), and they
confirmed the interaction by dot blot, native electrophoresis, and
fluorescence studies. The second SANT domain of DNAJC1 (SANT2) was
sufficient to bind AACT both in yeast and in vitro, and the interaction
was disrupted by a trp520-to-ala mutation in SANT2. AACT bound to SANT2
had no inhibitory activity toward chymotrypsin (see 118890). SANT2
significantly slowed formation of the AACT-chymotrypsin acyl complex
with no significant effect on the catalytic efficiency of chymotrypsin.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DNAJC1
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP SGC32110).

;;ATH3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins expressed in
developing pancreas and mature islet cells, followed by RT-PCR of adult
human pancreatic islet mRNA, Horikawa et al. (2000) cloned NEUROD4.
Human and mouse NEUROD4 share 88.5% amino acid identity overall and 100%
identity within their bHLH regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuda et al. (1998) stated that mouse Neurod4, which they called Math3,
is initially expressed throughout the developing nervous system, then
gradually becomes restricted to neural retina. By functional analysis,
they identified a proximal region of the Math3 promoter necessary for
neuron-specific expression and an upstream region necessary for retinal
expression.

Lee and Pfaff (2003) showed that Neurod4, which they called NeuroM, and
Ngn2 (NEUROG2; 606624) actively participated with Isl1 (600366) and Lhx3
(600577) to specify motor neuron subtype in embryonic chicken spinal
cord and in P19 mouse stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Horikawa et al. (2000) determined that the NEUROD4 gene contains 2 exons
and spans about 10 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Horikawa et al. (2000) mapped the
NEUROD4 gene to chromosome 12q13. Tsuda et al. (1998) stated that the
mouse Neurod4 gene maps to chromosome 10.

CENEXIN 1 VARIANT 1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ODF2 encodes multiple protein isoforms that have roles in the formation
of primary cilia and sperm flagella and in coordinating ciliary beating
(Kunimoto et al., 2012).

CLONING

See ODF1 (182878). Brohmann et al. (1997) used antibodies against Odf
proteins to screen a rat testis expression library and isolated the rat
Odf2 gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein has an overall
alpha-helical structure with 2 regions identical to the dimerization
region of a leucine zipper motif. Brohmann et al. (1997) documented Odf2
cDNAs with 3 different 5-prime end sequences, presumed to be the result
of alternative splicing. They found expression of the rat gene only in
testis.

The EST database contains several human cDNA sequences which are closely
related to rat Odf2, suggesting that a human homolog exists (Scott,
1997). These human cDNA sequences were derived from testis, epididymis,
and fetal brain libraries.

Shao et al. (1997) used a yeast 2-hybrid screening with the leucine
zipper region of ODF1 (ODF27; Shao and van der Hoorn, 1996) as bait to
isolate rat testis-specific proteins that could interact with ODF27.
They demonstrated that one of the novel genes isolated encoded the 84-kD
ODF protein ODF2.

Soung et al. (2006) stated that the deduced 638-amino acid ODF2 protein
has 2 leucine zipper motifs in its C-terminal half. Using an inactive
mutant of the mitotic kinase PLK1 (602098) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a human testis cDNA library, followed by RT-PCR of HeLa cell
RNA, they identified 2 splice variants of ODF2 that they called
cenexin-1 and cenexin-1 variant-1. Cenexin-1 and cenexin-1 variant-1
encode proteins of 805 and 824 amino acids, respectively. Both isoforms
contain a C-terminal extension compared with ODF2, and cenexin-1
variant-1 also has a 19-amino acid insertion near its N-terminal end.
Northern blot analysis of synchronized HeLa cells detected a single
transcript of about 4.0 kb, representing cenexin-1. Cenexin-1 localized
at the microtubule-organizing center in interphase and at spindle poles
in mitosis, suggesting that cenexin-1 is a centrosomal protein.
Fluorescence-tagged cenexin-1 primarily localized to the mother
centrosome in interphase and to both mother and daughter centrosomes in
mitosis.

Using real-time RT-PCR with a probe for the 3-prime region of mouse
Odf2/cenexin, Kunimoto et al. (2012) detected highest expression in
mouse trachea and lung, with much lower expression in brain, and little
to no expression in heart, liver, and kidney. Western blot analysis
using an antibody against the N-terminal region of Odf2/cenexin detected
an apparent 75-kD protein in mouse testis and an apparent 90-kD protein
in mouse trachea, lung, kidney, brain, and oviduct.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soung et al. (2006) determined that the ODF2 gene contains 21 exons and
spans 44.8 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Shao et al. (1998) mapped the human ODF2 gene to chromosome
9q34. Soung et al. (2006) mapped the ODF2 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 by
genomic sequence analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Soung et al.
(2006) confirmed that cenexin-1 interacted directly with PLK1. Mutation
analysis revealed that the C-terminal domain of cenexin-1 interacted
with the polo-box domain of PLK1. The C-terminal domain of cenexin-1 was
also required to recruit PLK1 to centrosomes. Depletion of cenexin-1
from HeLa cells delocalized centrosomal PLK1, diminished gamma-tubulin
(see 191135) recruitment to centrosomes, and altered localization of a
subset of centrosomal proteins required for microtubule nucleation and
function. Depletion of cenexin-1 also resulted in severe mitotic
defects, including chromosome alignment and segregation defects. A
significant fraction of these cells also showed multipolar chromosomes
and apoptotic cell death.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kunimoto et al. (2012) developed a line of mice with deletion of exons 6
and 7 of Odf2, which they called Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice. Homozygous
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio, but
only 20% survived past weaning. Surviving mice were characterized by a
coughing/sneezing-like phenotype, sinusitis, otitis media, and a slight
tendency to hydrocephaly, suggesting primary ciliary dyskinesia. Unlike
Odf2 -/- F9 embryonic mouse carcinoma cells, homozygous
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice were born with primary cilia and expressed low
levels of N-terminally truncated Odf2/cenexin. Antibody raised against
the Odf2/cenexin C-terminal region detected slight immunofluorescence at
the base of cilia in homozygous Odf2(delta-ex6,7) tracheal cells, but
not in Odf2 -/- F9 cells. Cilium appeared to nucleate from the basal
body in Odf2(delta-ex6,7) cells, but the basal foot was completely lost,
and basal bodies failed to position apically in some cells. Basal feet
were also absent in oviduct epithelial cells and ependymal cells in
brains of homozygous Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice. Live imaging of isolated
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) trachea preparations revealed uncoordinated ciliary
beating and inefficient fluid flow across the luminal surface.
Deficiency of full-length Odf2/cenexin also perturbed the polarized
distribution of planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins and PCP-dependent
apical organization of microtubules.
