;;ADENYLATE KINASE, MITOCHONDRIAL MYOKINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleoside monophosphate kinases, including adenylate kinases, catalyze
the reversible phosphorylation between nucleoside triphosphates and
monophosphates.

CLONING

Bruns and Regina (1977) analyzed the subcellular compartmentalization of
adenylate kinase-2 (EC 2.7.4.3) in HeLa cells, mouse RAG cells, and
RAG-human hybrids expressing human AK2. The results indicated that AK2
is a mitochondrial enzyme.

Noma et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human adenylate kinase-2 from
a HeLa cell cDNA library, using bovine AK2 cDNA as probe. Two
transcripts were identified: one, designated AK2A, encodes a deduced
239-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26.5 kD, and
the other, designated AK2B, encodes a deduced 232-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kD. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated 3 strong hybridizing signals of 0.9 (AK2A), 1.7 (AK2B), and
3.5 kb, with high expression in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, moderate expression in kidney, placenta, and brain, and weak
expression in lung. However, Western blot analysis showed high levels of
AK2 protein in liver, heart, and kidney, low levels in lung, and
undetectable levels in brain and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

The existence of a second adenylate kinase locus linked to PGM1 and
peptidase C, i.e., on chromosome 1, was suggested by cell hybridization
studies by Van Cong et al. (1972). The Goss-Harris method of mapping
combines features of recombinational study in families and synteny tests
in hybrid cells. As applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2
and UMPK are distal to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1:
UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC): ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Carritt et al.
(1982) presented evidence that AK2 is in 1p34.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD (602457), and
CASP10 (601762). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3 (600636). Apoptosis
through the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase
activity of AK2, did not require CASP8 (601763)-mediated apoptotic
responses, and did not involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
Immunodepletion or knockdown of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated
etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2 complexes were not observed in
several etoposide-resistant human tumor cell lines that were deficient
in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3. In contrast to the findings in
human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis was observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression. Since mice also lack Casp10,
Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack an apoptotic pathway
comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in humans.

Pannicke et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads
to aberrant leukocyte development, demonstrating the evolutionarily
conserved role of AK2. They concluded that their results provide in vivo
evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected individuals from 5 families segregating reticular
dysgenesis (267500), Pannicke et al. (2009) identified 6 causative
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(103020.0001-103020.0006).

Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009) identified biallelic mutations in AK2
(103020.0007-103020.0013) in 7 individuals with reticular dysgenesis.
These mutations resulted in absent or strongly decreased protein
expression. The authors then demonstrated that restoration of AK2
expression in the bone marrow cells of individuals with reticular
dysgenesis overcomes the neutrophil differentiation arrest, underlining
its specific requirement in the development of a restricted set of
hematopoietic lineages. Finally, Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009)
established that AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis
region of the inner ear, which provides an explanation for the
sensorineural deafness in these individuals. Lagresle-Peyrou et al.
(2009) concluded that their results identified a previously unknown
mechanism involved in regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation
in one of the most severe human immunodeficiency syndromes.

truncation of the protein, and a 1A-G transition leading to a
met1-to-val (M1V) substitution (103020.0003). The mutation led to a

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PI3 is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a major role as an
antiinflammatory mediator at mucosal surfaces. In addition, PI3 has
antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial
and fungal pathogens (summary by Ghosh et al., 2009).

CLONING

Chang et al. (1990) and Schalkwijk et al. (1990, 1991) described a low
molecular weight elastase inhibitor derived from psoriatic skin and
termed SKALP for 'skin-derived antileukoproteinase.' They demonstrated
that this inhibitor can be found in the epidermis of several
inflammatory skin diseases, but not in normal human epidermis. Wiedow et
al. (1990) referred to this molecule as elafin, and Sallenave and Ryle
(1991) referred to it as elastase-specific inhibitor. It is found in the
urine of psoriatic patients, and immunohistochemical studies showed that
SKALP/elafin is found in the suprabasal differentiated keratinocytes of
psoriatic epidermis. Molhuizen et al. (1993) isolated a precursor of
SKALP/elafin from cultured keratinocytes and cloned its cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Elafin is an antiproteinase and antimicrobial molecule that is expressed
at epithelial sites (for example, cervix) (Sallenave, 2000). King et al.
(2003) studied the expression and regulation of elafin in human
endometrium. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that expression of elafin
mRNA peaked during menstruation. Elafin protein was localized to
leukocytes scattered in the endometrial stroma during the late secretory
and menstrual phases. The authors concluded that endometrium expresses
elafin in a menstruation-dependent manner.

Using RT-PCR and ELISA, Ghosh et al. (2009) detected elafin production
in the female reproductive tract. Elafin production was enhanced
following poly (I:C) stimulation. Recombinant elafin inhibited both
lymphotropic and macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1
strains in a dose-dependent manner, possibly through direct interaction
with the virus. Secreted elafin levels were higher, although not
significantly, in cervico-vaginal lavages of HIV-1-negative women
compared with HIV-1-positive women, and they were also higher in the
secretory phase of the menstrual cycle compared with the proliferative
phase. Ghosh et al. (2009) proposed that elafin may be an important
endogenous microbicide in the female reproductive tract that is
protective against HIV-1.

MAPPING

Molhuizen et al. (1994) localized the PI3 gene to chromosome 20 by study
of somatic cell hybrids and to 20q12-q13 by in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kuijpers et al. (1998) could find no allelic association between
pustular psoriasis, or psoriasis in general (see 177900), and
polymorphism of the PI3 gene. The study was prompted by the finding of a
decrease of SKALP, at the protein level, in lesional skin of patients
with pustular psoriasis compared with plaque-type psoriasis.

160760	TITLE *160760 MYOSIN, HEAVY CHAIN 7, CARDIAC MUSCLE, BETA; MYH7
;;MYOSIN, CARDIAC, HEAVY CHAIN, BETA; MYHCB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The structural gene for the beta heavy chain of myosin is expressed
predominantly in fetal life and is switched on in older animals under
conditions of thyroid hormone depletion/replacement and in response to
some physical stresses. Jandreski et al. (1987) presented evidence
indicating that the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain mRNA is expressed in
skeletal muscle tissue. The expression of cardiac beta-myosin heavy
chain mRNA was particularly prominent in the soleus muscle, which is
rich in slow-twitch type I muscle fibers. There were only trace amounts
in the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis, which consist predominantly
of fast-twitch type II fibers.

Diederich et al. (1989) cloned the entire gene.

By scanning mouse myosin genes for intronic microRNAs (miRNAs), van
Rooij et al. (2009) identified Mir208b (613613) within intron 31 of the
Myh7 gene. Northern blot analysis showed that Myh7 and Mir208b were
highly expressed in mouse slow-twitch soleus muscle. Little to no
expression was detected in heart and in the fast-twitch
gastrocnemius/plantaris, tibialis anterior, and extensor digitorum
longus muscles. However, van Rooij et al. (2009) noted that Myh7 is the
predominant myosin in adult heart in large animals, whereas Myh6
(160710) predominates in adult mouse heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jaenicke et al. (1990) demonstrated that the MYH7 gene is 22,883 bp
long. The 1,935 amino acids of this protein are encoded by 38 exons. The
5-prime untranslated region (86 bp) is split by 2 introns. The 3-prime
untranslated region is 114 bp long. Three Alu repeats were identified
within the gene and a fourth one in the 3-prime flanking intergenic
region.

Liew et al. (1990) found that like the rat skeletal myosin heavy chain
gene, the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene is divided into 41 exons,
the first 2 of which are noncoding. However, exons 37 and 38 are fused;
they do not have an intervening intron. The gene extends for 21,828
nucleotides and encodes a deduced 1,1939-amino acid protein with a
molecular mass of 222,937 Da.

Van Rooij et al. (2009) identified a microRNA (miRNA), Mir208b (613613),
within intron 31 of the mouse Myh7 gene.

MAPPING

Matsuoka et al. (1989) found that both the alpha and the beta human
cardiac myosin heavy chain genes are located in the 14cen-q13 region;
the assignment was by somatic cell hybridization and in situ
hybridization. Qin et al. (1990) localized the MYH7 gene to 14q12 by in
situ hybridization.

The beta cardiac myosin heavy chain is located on chromosome 14, 3.6 kb
upstream from the alpha cardiac myosin gene. The 2 genes are oriented in
a head-to-tail tandem fashion (Yamauchi-Takihara et al., 1989;
Geisterfer-Lowrance et al., 1990).

GENE FUNCTION

Van Rooij et al. (2007) found that miRNA208A (MIR208A; 611116), a
cardiac-specific miRNA encoded by intron 27 of the mouse and human MYH6
gene, was required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and
expression of Myh7 in response to stress and hypothyroidism in mice.

Van Rooij et al. (2009) found that expression of Myh7 and its
intronically encoded miRNA, Mir208b, was upregulated in mouse heart by
hypothyroidism caused by inhibition of triiodothyronine (T3; see 188450)
synthesis. This upregulation was reversed by T3 administration. Gain-
and loss-of-function experiments in mice showed that expression of Myh7
and Mir208b was controlled by the dominant miRNA in mouse heart,
Mir208a. However, van Rooij et al. (2009) noted that, in large animals,
Myh7 is the predominant myosin in adult heart. In contrast, the
predominant myosin in adult mouse heart is Myh6, the host gene of
Mir208a. Thus, van Rooij et al. (2009) suggested that Mir208b, which
shares the same seed sequence as Mir208a, may fulfill the function of
Mir208a in large animals.

In mice, adult cardiomyocytes primarily express alpha-myosin heavy chain
(alpha-MHC, also known as Myh6; 160710), whereas embryonic
cardiomyocytes express beta-MHC (Myh7). Cardiac stress triggers adult
hearts to undergo hypertrophy and a shift from alpha-MHC to fetal
beta-MHC expression. Hang et al. (2010) showed that BRG1 (603254), a
chromatin-remodeling protein, has a critical role in regulating cardiac
growth, differentiation, and gene expression. In embryos, Brg1 promotes
myocyte proliferation by maintaining Bmp10 (608748) and suppressing
p57(kip2) (600856) expression. It preserves fetal cardiac
differentiation by interacting with histone deacetylases (HDACs; see
601241) and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP; 173870) to repress
alpha-MHC and activate beta-MHC. In adults, Brg1 (also known as Smarca4)
is turned off in cardiomyocytes. It is reactivated by cardiac stresses
and forms a complex with its embryonic partners, HDAC and PARP, to
induce a pathologic alpha-MHC-to-beta-MHC shift. Preventing Brg1
reexpression decreases hypertrophy and reverses this MHC switch. BRG1 is
activated in certain patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, its
level correlating with disease severity and MHC changes. Hang et al.
(2010) concluded that their studies showed that BRG1 maintains
cardiomyocytes in an embryonic state, and demonstrated an epigenetic
mechanism by which 3 classes of chromatin-modifying factors, BRG1, HDAC,
and PARP, cooperate to control developmental and pathologic gene
expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 1

McKenna (1993) estimated that 40 to 50% of cases of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH; 192600) are due to mutations in the MYH7 gene. He
stated that Kaplan-Meier survival curves for these mutations showed that
the val606-to-met mutation (160760.0005) was associated with normal
survivorship, whereas the arg453-to-cys mutation (160760.0003) was
associated with death in about half the affected individuals by age 40
years.

Anan et al. (1994) presented a schematic of 15 mutations within the MYH7
gene that cause CMH. They described a phe513-to-cys mutation
(160760.0016) in which affected family members had near-normal life
expectancy, and an arg719-to-trp mutation (160760.0017) in 4 unrelated
CMH families with a high incidence of premature death and an average
life expectancy in affected individuals of 38 years. They suggested that
these findings supported the hypothesis that mutations that alter the
charge of the encoded amino acid affects survival more significantly
than those that produce a conservative amino acid change. Kelly and
Strauss (1994) pointed out that all but one of the known mutations of
the MYH7 gene that produce hypertrophic cardiomyopathy result in amino
acid substitutions in the protein head or the region in which the head
and rod of the molecule intersect. In their Figure 2, they diagrammed
the cardiac myosin heavy-chain dimer and the site of the mutations. They
suggested that these mutations represent dominant negatives by
disturbing contractile function despite the production of a normal
protein by the remaining normal allele. Consistent with this conclusion
is the finding of Cuda et al. (1993) that mutant beta-myosin separated
from the heart muscle in cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of the
chromosome 14 type translocate actin filaments with an abnormally low
sliding velocity in motility assays in vitro.

Lankford et al. (1995) compared the contractile properties of single
slow-twitch muscle fibers from patients with 3 distinct CMH-causing MYH7
mutations with those from normal controls. Fibers from the gly741-to-arg
mutation (160760.0011), located near the binding site of essential light
chain, demonstrated decreased maximum velocity of shortening (39% of
normal) and decreased isometric force generation (42% of normal). Fibers
with the arg403-to-gln mutation (160760.0001) (at the actin interface of
myosin) showed lower force/stiffness ratio (56% of normal) and depressed
velocity of shortening (50% of normal). Both of these
mutation-containing fibers displayed abnormal force-velocity
relationships and reduced power output. Fibers from the gly256-to-glu
mutation (160760.0012), located at the end of the ATP-binding pocket,
had contractile properties that were indistinguishable from normal.
Thus, variability was found in the nature and extent of functional
impairments in skeletal fibers containing different MYH7 gene mutations,
and this variability may correlate with the severity and penetrance of
the disease resulting from each mutation.

Rayment et al. (1995) examined 29 missense mutations in the MYH7 gene
that are responsible for 10 to 30% of familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy cases and analyzed their effects on the 3-dimensional
structure of skeletal muscle myosin. Arai et al. (1995) reported a
thirtieth missense mutation and stated that these had been found in 49
families worldwide at that time. Almost all were located in the region
of the gene coding for the globular head of the molecule and only 1
mutation was found in both Caucasian and Japanese families.

Seidman (2000) pointed out that correlations between genotype and
prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is possible. Life expectancy is
markedly diminished in individuals with the R719W (160760.0017) and
R403Q (160760.0001) mutations in the MYH7 gene but near normal in
individuals with the E542Q (600958.0006) and 791insG (600958.0011)
mutations in the MYBPC3 gene.

Woo et al. (2003) screened 70 probands with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
for mutations in the beta-MHC gene. Mutations in this gene were detected
in 15 of 70 probands (21%). Eleven mutations were detected, including 4
novel mutations. Median survival was 66 years (95% CI 64 to 77 years) in
all affected subjects. There was a significant difference in survival
between subjects according to the affected functional domain.
Significant independent predictors of decreased survival were the
nonconservative missense mutations that affected the actin binding site
and those that affected the rod portion of beta-MHC.

Hougs et al. (2005) screened for mutations in the rod region (exons 24
to 40) of MYH7 in 92 Danish patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Using capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism,
3 disease-causing mutations of the rod region were identified in 4
patients, including the R1712W (160760.0032) mutation in 2 patients. Two
of the patients had already been shown to carry other FHC-associated
mutations.

Arad et al. (2005) identified 2 different MYH7 missense mutations in 2
probands with apical hypertrophy from families in which the mutations
also caused other CMH morphologies (see 160760.0038 and 160760.0039,
respectively), and 1 in a sporadic patient with apical hypertrophy
(R243H; 160760.0040).

In a consanguineous British family in which 3 sibs developed
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, and myosin storage
myopathy (608358), Tajsharghi et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for
a missense mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760.0035).

In a Japanese proband with CMH (CMH17; 613873), Matsushita et al. (2007)
identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the JPH2 gene
(605267.0004); subsequent analysis of 15 known CMH-associated genes
revealed that the proband also carried 2 mutations in MYH7, F513C
(160760.0016) and A26V. The authors suggested that mutations in both
JPH2 and MYH7 could be associated with the pathogenesis of CMH in this
proband.

In a 32-year-old African American woman with severe hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy and a family history of CMH and sudden cardiac death,
Frazier et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous mutation in the TNNI3
gene (P82S; 191044.0003) and a heterozygous mutation in the MYH7 gene
(R453S; 160760.0043).

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1S

Kamisago et al. (2000) performed clinical evaluations in 21 kindreds
with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1S; 613426). In a genomewide
linkage study, a genetic locus for mutations associated with dilated
cardiomyopathy was identified at chromosome 14q11.2-q13 (maximum lod
score = 5.11 at theta = 0.0). Analysis of MYH7 and other genes for
sarcomere proteins revealed heterozygous missense mutations in MYH7 in 2
kindreds (S532P, 160760.0022 and P764L, 160760.0023, respectively).
Affected individuals had neither antecedent cardiac hypertrophy nor
histopathologic findings characteristic of hypertrophy.

- Myosin Storage Myopathy, Laing Distal Myopathy, and Scapuloperoneal
Myopathy

In affected members of a family and in an unrelated patient with myosin
storage myopathy (608358), Tajsharghi et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760.0028).

Laing et al. (1995) mapped Laing distal myopathy (160500) to chromosome
14. In affected members of 7 separate families with Laing distal
myopathy, Meredith et al. (2004) sequenced the MYH7 gene, a positional
candidate for the site of the causative mutation. They identified 5
heterozygous mutations in 6 families (see 160760.0029-160760.0030) and
no mutations in the seventh family. All 5 mutations were predicted, by
in silico analysis, to disrupt locally the ability of the myosin tail to
form a coiled coil, which is its normal structure. The findings
demonstrated that heterozygous mutations toward the 3-prime end of MYH7
can cause Laing distal myopathy.

Pegoraro et al. (2007) conducted MYH7 gene analysis by
RT-PCR/SSCP/sequencing in 2 patients diagnosed with myosin storage
myopathy and 17 patients diagnosed with scapuloperoneal myopathy of
unknown etiology. They found the R1845W mutation of the MYH7 gene in
both cases of myosin storage myopathy and in 2 of the 17 scapuloperoneal
patients (181430) studied. 5533C-T segregation analysis in the mutation
carrier families identified 11 additional patients. The clinical
spectrum in this cohort of patients included asymptomatic hyperCKemia
(elevated serum creatine kinase), scapuloperoneal myopathy, and proximal
and distal myopathy with muscle hypertrophy. Muscle MRI identified a
unique pattern in the posterior compartment of the thigh, characterized
by early involvement of the biceps femoris and semimembranosus, with
relative sparing of the semitendinosus. Muscle biopsy revealed hyaline
bodies characteristic of myosin storage myopathy in only half of
biopsied patients (2 of 4). These patients without hyaline bodies had
been diagnosed with scapuloperoneal myopathy prior to the identification
of hyaline bodies in other family members, prompting MYH7 gene analysis.
The authors pointed out that patients without hyaline bodies presented
later onset and milder severity.

Armel and Leinwand (2009) analyzed the functional effects of 4 different
MYH7 mutations in the rod or tail domain that were found to be
responsible for myosin storage myopathy: R1845W (160760.0028), H1901L
(160760.0031), E1886K (160760.0035), and L1793P (160760.0037). None of
the mutations altered the secondary structure of the protein, but L1793P
and H1901L showed decreased thermodynamic stability. All mutations
decreased the extent of self-assembly of the light meromyosin rod (less
than 50 to 60%) compared to the wildtype protein. R1845W and H1901L
showed formation of more stable and larger filaments, whereas L1793P and
E1886K showed more rapid filament degradation. Armel and Leinwand (2009)
noted that the assembly of muscle filaments is a multistep process that
involves both the proper folding of alpha-helices into coiled-coils, and
the assembly of these coiled-coils, in proper register, into filaments,
and concluded that defects in any one of these steps can result in
improper filament formation leading to muscle disease.

- Left Ventricular Noncompaction 5

Klaassen et al. (2008) analyzed 6 genes encoding sarcomere proteins in
63 unrelated adult probands with left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC)
but no other congenital heart anomalies (see LVNC5; 613426), and
identified 7 different heterozygous mutations in the MYH7 gene in the
probands from 4 families and in 4 sporadic patients (see, e.g.,
160760.0040-160760.0042). Klaassen et al. (2008) noted that 5 of the 7
mutations were located within the genomic sequence of exon 8 to exon 9
of MYH7, which appeared to be a cluster for LVNC mutations.

In a mother with myosin storage myopathy, who later developed CMH, and
in her daughter, who had early-symptomatic LVNC, Uro-Coste et al. (2009)
identified heterozygosity for the L1793P mutation in MYH7 (160760.0037).

In an analysis of the MYH7 gene in 141 white probands of western
European descent diagnosed with Ebstein anomaly (see 224700), Postma et
al. (2011) identified heterozygous mutations in 8 (see, e.g.,
160760.0045 and 160760.0046). Of these 8 probands, LVNC was present in 7
and uncertain in 1, whereas none of the 133 mutation-negative probands
had LVNC. Evaluation of all available family members of
mutation-positive probands revealed 3 families in which additional
mutation-positive individuals had cardiomyopathy or congenital heart
malformations, including type II atrial septal defect, ventricular
septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, and pulmonary
artery stenosis/hypoplasia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Geisterfer-Lowrance et al. (1996) engineered the human CMH cardiac
myosin heavy chain gene mutation arg403-to-gln (R403Q) into the mouse
genome to create a murine model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Homozygous mice died within a week after birth, while heterozygous mice
displayed both histologic and hemodynamic abnormalities characteristic
of CMH. In addition, the CMH mice demonstrated gender and developmental
differences. Male CMH mice demonstrated more severe myocyte hypertrophy,
disarray, and interstitial fibrosis than their female littermates, and
both sexes showed increased cardiac dysfunction and histopathology as
they aged. Heterozygous CMH mice also had sudden death of uncertain
etiology, especially during periods of exercise. Berul et al. (1997)
found that in contrast to wildtype mice which had completely normal
cardiac electrophysiology, CMH mice demonstrated (a)
electrocardiographic abnormalities including prolonged repolarization
intervals and rightward axis; (b) electrophysiologic abnormalities
including heterogeneous ventricular conduction properties and prolonged
sinus node recovery time; and (c) inducible ventricular ectopy.

Fatkin et al. (1999) reported further studies of the CMH mouse in which
the arg403-to-gln mutation had been introduced by homologous
recombination. Heterozygous mice developed myocardial histologic
abnormalities similar to those in human CMH by 15 weeks of age.
Sedentary heterozygous mice had a normal life span. Homozygous mutant
mice were liveborn, but, unlike their heterozygous littermates, all died
within 1 week. Fatkin et al. (1999) found that neonatal lethality was
caused by a fulminant dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by myocyte
dysfunction and loss. They studied cardiac dimensions and functions for
the first time in neonatal mice by high frequency (45 MHz)
echocardiography and found that both were normal at birth. Between days
4 and 6, homozygous deficient mice developed a rapidly progressive
cardiomyopathy with left ventricular dilation, wall thinning, and
reduced systolic contraction. Histopathology revealed myocardial
necrosis with dystrophic calcification. Electron microscopy showed
normal architecture intermixed with focal myofibrillar disarray. Fatkin
et al. (1999) speculated that variable incorporation of mutant and
normal MYHC into sarcomeres of heterozygotes may account for focal
myocyte death in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

In R403Q-knockin mice, Gao et al. (1999) observed that during twitch
contractions, peak intracellular Ca(2+) was higher in mutant muscles
than in wildtype muscles, but force development was equivalent in both.
Developed force fell at higher stimulation rates in the mutants but not
in controls. Gao et al. (1999) concluded that calcium cycling and
myofilament properties are both altered in CMH mutant mice.

Marian et al. (1999) created a transgenic rabbit model of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy by injecting a transgene carrying the R403Q mutation into
fertilized zygotes. Expression of transgene mRNA and protein were
confirmed by Northern blotting and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis
followed by immunoblotting, respectively. Animals carrying the mutant
transgene showed substantial myocyte disarray and a 3-fold increase in
interstitial collagen expression in the myocardium. Mean septal
thickness was comparable between rabbits carrying the wildtype transgene
and nontransgenic littermates, but was significantly increased in the
mutant transgenic animals. Posterior wall thickness and left ventricular
mass were also increased, but dimensions and systolic function were
normal. Premature death was more common in mutant than in wildtype
transgenic rabbits or in nontransgenic littermates. Thus, the phenotype
of patients with the R403Q mutation of the MYH7 was reproduced.

To minimize confounding variables while assessing relationships between
CMH histopathology and arrhythmia vulnerability, Wolf et al. (2005)
generated inbred CMH mice carrying the R403Q mutation and observed
variable susceptibility to arrhythmias, differences in ventricular
hypertrophy, and variable amounts and distribution of fibrosis and
myocyte disarray. There was no correlation between the amount and/or
pattern of fibrosis or the quantity of myocyte disarray and the
propensity for arrhythmia as assessed by ex vivo high-resolution mapping
and in vivo electrophysiologic study; however, the amount of ventricular
hypertrophy was significantly associated with increased arrhythmia
susceptibility. Wolf et al. (2005) concluded that the 3 cardinal
manifestations of CMH (cardiac hypertrophy, myocyte fibrosis, and
disarray) reflect independent pathologic processes within myocytes
carrying a sarcomere gene mutation and that the severity of fibrosis and
disarray is substantially influenced by unknown somatic factors, and
they suggested that a shared pathway triggered by sarcomere gene
mutations links cardiac hypertrophy and arrhythmias in CMH.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 1
MYH7, ARG403GLN

In the large French-Canadian kindred originally reported by Pare et al.
(1961) and shown to have linkage of the cardiac disorder (192600) to
markers on the proximal portion of 14q, Geisterfer-Lowrance et al.
(1990) found a missense mutation in the beta cardiac myosin heavy chain
that converted arginine-403 to glutamine (R403Q). A guanine residue at
position 10,162 (enumerated as in Jaenicke et al., 1990) was mutated to
an adenine residue. The mutation generated a new DdeI site and changed
the CGG(arg) codon to CAG(gln). Perryman et al. (1992) found that the
R403Q mutation was identifiable in myocardial mRNA. Ross and Knowlton
(1992) reviewed this discovery beginning with the patients first seen by
Pare in the 1950s.

Using an isolated, isovolumic heart preparation where cardiac
performance was measured simultaneously with cardiac energetics using
(31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Spindler et al. (1998)
studied the effects of the codon 403 missense mutation. They observed 3
major alterations in the physiology and bioenergetics of the mutant
mouse hearts. First, while there was no evidence for systolic
dysfunction, diastolic function was impaired during inotropic
stimulation. Diastolic dysfunction was manifest as both a decreased rate
of left ventricular relaxation and an increase in end-diastolic
pressure. Second, under baseline conditions the mutant R403Q mouse
hearts had lower phosphocreatine and increased inorganic phosphate
contents resulting in a decrease in the calculated value for the free
energy released from ATP hydrolysis. Third, mutant hearts that were
studied unpaced responded to increased perfusate calcium by decreasing
heart rate approximately twice as much as wildtypes. The authors
concluded that the hearts from mice carrying the R403Q mutation have
workload-dependent diastolic dysfunction resembling the human form of
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Changes in high-energy phosphate
content suggested that an energy-requiring process may contribute to the
observed diastolic dysfunction.

Bashyam et al. (2003) pointed out that polymorphism in the ACE1 gene
(106180) had been shown to affect the prognosis in familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. The DD allele of the ACE1 gene (106180.0001) was
associated with a severe form of hypertrophy and sudden death in
patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Iwai et al., 1994).
Tesson et al. (1997) established an association of the D allele at the
ACE1 locus with the R403Q mutation in MYH7, but not with MYBPC3 (600958)
mutations.

MYH7, ARG249GLN

Using a ribonuclease protection assay, Watkins et al. (1992) screened
the beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain genes of probands from 25 unrelated
families with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600). Seven
different mutations were identified in 12 of the 25 families; see
160760.0003-160760.0007. All were missense mutations; 5 were clustered
in the head of the beta-chain, which comprises the 5-prime 866 amino
acids, and 2 were located in the 5-prime or hinge portion of the rod
part. Six of the mutations resulted in a change in the charge of the
amino acid. These patients had a shorter life expectancy (mean age at
death, 33 years) than did patients with the one mutation that did not
produce a change in charge, val606-to-met. One of the mutations they
found was a substitution of glutamine for arginine-249.

.0003
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 1
MYH7, ARG453CYS

See 160760.0002. Watkins et al. (1992) found substitution of cysteine
for arginine-453 in 2 unrelated families with familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (192600). One of the families also had an alpha/beta
cardiac myosin heavy chain hybrid gene which was presumably of no
functional significance, inasmuch as the 5-prime promoter region was
derived from the alpha subunit.

In a 3-generation Chinese family, Ko et al. (1996) observed the
coexistence of sudden death and end-stage heart failure due to the
arg453-to-cys mutation. The average age of death in affected members of
the family was 34 years.

MYH7, GLY584ARG

See 160760.0002. Watkins et al. (1992) found the gly584-to-arg mutation
in 2 unrelated families with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(192600).

.0005
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 1
MYH7, VAL606MET

See 160760.0002. Watkins et al. (1992) found this mutation in 3
unrelated families with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600).
Of the 7 mutations they found, this was the only one that produced no
change in the charge of the amino acid. Although the affected patients
did not differ in other clinical manifestations of familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, patients in this family had nearly normal survival; mean
age at death was 33 years in the 11 families with one or another
mutation that substituted an amino acid with a different charge.

Blair et al. (2001) identified the val606-to-met mutation in a family in
which 2 individuals had suffered sudden death at an early age. The
mutation was found to be in cis with an ala728-to-val (A728V) mutation
(160760.0025).

MYH7, GLU924LYS

See 160760.0002. Watkins et al. (1992) found this mutation in 1 family
with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600). The mutation was
found in exon 23 by RNase protection assay. It occurred as a new
mutation in a 44-year-old female; the parents lacked the mutation which,
however, was transmitted to her 24-year-old daughter.

MYH7, ARG723CYS

Among 7 individuals with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600),
Watkins et al. (1992) identified mutations in the beta cardiac MHC genes
in 2. Since the parents were neither clinically nor genetically
affected, the authors concluded that the mutations in each proband arose
de novo. Transmission of the mutation and disease to an offspring
occurred in 1 pedigree (160760.0006), predicting that these were
germline mutations. One proband, a 40-year-old female, was shown by
RNase protection assay to have a C-to-T transition in exon 20 at
nucleotide 2253, leading to a change from arginine to cysteine at codon
723. Arginine residue 723 is conserved among all known cardiac MHCs and
all vertebrate striated muscle MHCs except the human perinatal and
rabbit skeletal isoforms; mutation of a cysteine residue constitutes a
nonconservative substitution with a change in net charge.

MYH7, 2.4-KB DEL

In a family with several members affected with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (192600), Marian et al. (1992) identified a novel 9.5-kb
BamHI RFLP detected by an MYH7 probe on Southern blots of DNA from the
proband. PCR was used to amplify the segment of the gene; sequence
analysis showed a 2.4-kb deletion involving 1 allele. The deletion
included part of intron 39, exon 40 including the 3-prime untranslated
region and the polyadenylation signal, and part of the region between
the beta and alpha myosin heavy chain genes. The deletion was inherited
by 2 daughters of the proband and a grandson, aged 33, 32, and 10 years,
respectively, who were, however, free of signs of the disorder. The
67-year-old proband had late onset of the disorder which was first
diagnosed in him at the age of 59 when he presented with atypical chest
pain, lightheadedness, and decreased exercise tolerance. On cardiac
examination, he showed an S4 heart sound and a systolic ejection murmur.
EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization
abnormalities. Ventricular hypertrophy was demonstrated by
echocardiogram which also showed systolic anterior motion of the
anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. There was a 25-mm Hg left
ventricular outflow tract gradient. From observations in C. elegans, it
was predicted that an unstable mRNA might result from this mutation.

MYH7, LEU908VAL

Fananapazir et al. (1993) found evidence, on soleus muscle biopsy, of
central core disease (117000) in 10 of 13 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
patients with the leu908-to-val mutation. Although the mutations in the
MYH7 gene were associated with skeletal muscle changes characteristic of
central core disease, such was not found in patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy unlinked to MYH7. Notably, in 1 branch of a family with
the L908V mutation, 2 adults and 3 children had histologic changes of
central core disease without evidence of cardiac hypertrophy by
echocardiogram. One of the adults had skeletal myopathic changes.
McKenna (1993), who stated that he had never seen clinical evidence of
skeletal myopathy in patients with CMH1 (192600), doubted the
significance of the findings.

MYH7, ARG403LEU

In 2 French pedigrees with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(192600), Dausse et al. (1993) performed linkage analysis using 2
microsatellite markers located in the MYH7 gene, as well as 4 highly
informative markers that mapped to the 14q11-q12 region. Linkage to the
markers was found in pedigree 720, but results were not conclusive for
pedigree 730. Haplotype of 6 markers allowed identification of affected
individuals and of some unaffected subjects who were carrying the
disease gene. Two novel missense mutations were identified in exon 13 by
direct sequencing: arg403-to-leu and arg403-to-trp in families 720 and
730, respectively. The arg403-to-leu mutation was associated with
incomplete penetrance, a high incidence of sudden deaths and severe
cardiac events, whereas the consequences of the arg403-to-trp mutation
appeared to be less severe. Codon 403 of the MYH7 gene appears,
therefore, to be a hotspot for mutations causing CMH. The first mutation
identified in this disorder involved codon 403 (160760.0001).

MYH7, PHE513CYS

In a family of Japanese ancestry in which a mild form of familial
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600) occurred, Anan et al. (1994) found
a 1624T-G transversion in exon 15, resulting in a phe513-to-cys (F513C)
substitution. The F513C mutation did not alter the charge of the encoded
amino acid, which may be related to the finding of near-normal life
expectancy in this family.

In a Japanese proband with CMH (CMH17; 613873), Matsushita et al. (2007)
identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the JPH2 gene
(605267.0004); subsequent analysis of 15 known CMH-associated genes
revealed that the proband also carried 2 heterozygous mutations in MYH7,
F513C and A26V. Her newborn son, who had no signs of CMH on
echocardiography at 1 day of age, carried both the JPH2 G505S mutation
and the MYH7 A26V mutation. The authors suggested that mutations in both
JPH2 and MYH7 could be associated with the pathogenesis of CMH in this
proband.

MYH7, ARG719TRP

In 4 unrelated families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600) with a
high incidence of premature death and an average life expectancy in
affected individuals of 38 years, Anan et al. (1994) found an R719W
mutation in exon 19 changing the charge of the amino acid by -1. The
difference in survival of individuals bearing the R719W mutation as
compared with those with the F513C mutation (160760.0016) was
demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier product-limit curves (their Figure 4).

In a 6.5-year-old boy with a severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
Jeschke et al. (1998) identified 2 missense mutations: one was the R719W
mutation and the other was an M349T mutation (160760.0020), which was
inherited through the maternal grandmother. Six family members who were
carriers of the M349T mutation were clinically unaffected. The authors
hypothesized that compound heterozygosity for the R719W and M349T
mutations resulted in the particularly severe phenotype of early onset.

In a small family from the U.K. in which 2 individuals affected by
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600) were alive, including one who had
been resuscitated after sudden death at age 19, Anan et al. (1994) found
a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 2232 resulting in a gly716-to-arg
(G716R) substitution (charge change = +1) of the encoded amino acid.

MYH7, GLU935LYS

In 2 brothers with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600) who died in
their thirties, Nishi et al. (1994) found a G-to-A transition in codon
935 of the MYH7 gene, leading to a replacement of glutamic acid with
lysine. The brothers were homozygous, whereas the parents, who were
first cousins, were heterozygous for the mutation and had cardiac
hypertrophy without clinical symptoms. An elder sister was also
heterozygous for the mutation but did not manifest cardiac hypertrophy.
Nishi et al. (1994) suggested that there was a gene dosage effect on
clinical manifestations in this family.

In a study of mutations causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600) in
2 South African subpopulations, Moolman-Smook et al. (1999) identified
an arg719-to-gln (R719Q) mutation in the MYH7 gene. The mutation
occurred in a family of white ancestry and had previously been described
by Watkins et al. (1992) in a Canadian family. The codon is the same as
that involved in the arg719-to-trp mutation (160760.0017).

In a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy-1S (613426), Kamisago
et al. (2000) demonstrated a T-to-C change at nucleotide 1680 in exon 16
of the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene, causing a ser532-to-pro
missense mutation. An affected member of this family had received a
cardiac transplant cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene. An affected
member of this family had received a cardiac transplant at 23 years of
age. A 20-year-old female suffered postpartum congestive heart failure
and sudden death. A female child developed congestive heart failure at 2
years of age.

In a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy-1S (613426), Kamisago
et al. (2000) found a C-to-G transversion at nucleotide 2378 in exon 21
of the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene, causing a phe764-to-leu
missense mutation. The 33-year-old father was given a diagnosis of
dilated cardiomyopathy at age 11 years. A daughter died suddenly at the
age of 2 months. A 4-year-old daughter, diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy at the time of birth, was found to have fetal left
ventricular dilatation.

Davis et al. (2001) identified a double point mutation in the MYLK2 gene
(606566) on the maternal haplotype in a 13-year-old white male proband
with early midventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see 192600). The
MYLK2 mutations were ala87 to val (A87V; 606566.0001) and ala95 to glu
(A95E; 606566.0002). The proband also inherited a glu743-to-asp mutation
(E743D) in the beta-myosin gene (MYH7) from his father. Although the son
had significant disease at an early age, the father and mother came to
medical attention only after the diagnosis of the son. Echocardiographic
evaluation showed that both parents had similarly abnormal
asymmetrically thickened hearts. The kindred was too small for linkage
analysis, and the authors proposed that the mutant MYLK2 may be
functionally abnormal and may consequently stimulate cardiac
hypertrophy. Davis et al. (2001) concluded that the increased severity
of the disease at such a young age in the proband suggests a compound
effect.

Blair et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition in exon 20 resulting

160760.0005) mutation in a family in which 3 individuals had suffered
sudden death. Blair et al. (2001) suggested that this second mutation in
cis with the V606M mutation was responsible for the more severe
phenotype in this family.

In a series of 46 young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy-1S
(613426), Daehmlow et al. (2002) identified 2 mutations in the MYH7
gene, one of which was a G-to-A transition in exon 8 at nucleotide 7799,
resulting in an ala223-to-thr (A223T) substitution. The mutation
affected a buried residue near the ATP-binding site. The patient with
this mutation was 35 years old when diagnosed with dilated

In a series of 46 young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy-1S

of which was a C-to-T transition in exon 17 at nucleotide 12164,
resulting in a ser642-to-leu (S642L) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation occurred at the actin-myosin interface. The
patient with this mutation was 18 years old when diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy.

MYH7, ARG1845TRP

In affected members of a family and in an unrelated patient with myosin
storage myopathy (608358) without cardiomyopathy, Tajsharghi et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous 23014C-T transition in the MYH7 gene,
resulting in an arg1845-to-trp (R1845W) substitution. The mutation is
located in the distal end of the filament-forming rod region of the
protein. Tajsharghi et al. (2003) suggested that the mutation may
interfere with the interaction of MYH7 with myosin-binding proteins and
inhibit myosin assembly into thick filaments.

Laing et al. (2005) identified the R1845W mutation in 2 unrelated
Belgian patients with myosin storage myopathy. Neither patient had a
family history of the disease. The mutation was predicted to impair the
coiled-coil structure of the protein.

Pegoraro et al. (2007) conducted MYH7 gene analysis by
RT-PCR/SSCP/sequencing in 2 patients diagnosed with myosin storage
myopathy and 17 patients diagnosed with scapuloperoneal myopathy of
unknown etiology. They found the arg1845-to-trp mutation of the MYH7
gene in both cases of myosin storage myopathy and in 2 of the 17
scapuloperoneal patients (181430) studied. 5533C-T segregation analysis
in the mutation carrier families identified 11 additional patients. The
clinical spectrum in this cohort of patients included asymptomatic
hyperCKemia (elevated serum creatine kinase), scapuloperoneal myopathy,
and proximal and distal myopathy with muscle hypertrophy. Muscle MRI
identified a unique pattern in the posterior compartment of the thigh,
characterized by early involvement of the biceps femoris and
semimembranosus, with relative sparing of the semitendinosus. Pegoraro
et al. (2007) concluded that phenotypic and histopathologic variability
may underlie MYH7 gene mutation and that the absence of hyaline bodies
in muscle biopsies does not rule out MYH7 gene mutations.

By functional analysis, Armel and Leinwand (2009) showed that the R1845W
mutant protein was nearly indistinguishable from wildtype in both
secondary structural characteristics and biophysical parameters.
However, compared to the wildtype protein, the mutant protein was unable
to assemble to the same extent, formed larger structures, and formed
more stable paracrystals. The results suggested that the R1845W mutation
alters the interactions between filaments such that their assembly is
less constrained, causing the formation of abnormally large,
degradation-resistant structures. Similar results were found for H1901L
(160760.0031).

.0029
LAING DISTAL MYOPATHY
MYH7, ARG1500PRO

In an Australian patient with sporadic Laing distal myopathy (160500),
Meredith et al. (2004) identified an arg1500-to-pro (R1500P) mutation in
exon 32 of the MYH7 gene. Mild talipes equinovarus had been noted at
birth but corrected itself. By the time the patient was 4 years old, she
was noted to have weakness of ankle dorsiflexion. Progressive weakness
of legs and hands followed, with involvement of the arms at 11 years of
age.

et al., 2000), Meredith et al. (2004) identified deletion of a lysine at
position 1617 in exon 34 of the MYH7 gene.

MYOPATHY, MYOSIN STORAGE
MYH7, HIS1904LEU

In affected members of a Saudi Arabian family with autosomal dominant
hyaline body myopathy, or myosin storage myopathy (608358), reported by
Bohlega et al. (2003), Bohlega et al. (2004) identified a 25596A-T
transversion in the MYH7 gene, resulting in a his1904-to-leu (H1904L)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the coiled-coil tail
region of the protein. The mutation was not identified in 130 control
chromosomes. None of the patients had cardiac abnormalities. The authors
noted that the H1904L mutation is adjacent to a critical assembly
competent domain and suggested that the mutation may cause improper
assembly of the thick filament or interfere with stability of the
protein.

Oldfors et al. (2005) used a different numbering system and stated that
the mutation described by Bohlega et al. (2004) should be HIS1901LEU.
They asserted that the histidine at residue 1901 occupies the 'f'
position of the heptad repeat of the coiled-coil domain, whereas residue
1904 is not at an 'f' position in the heptad repeat sequence. In
response, Meyer (2005) stated that the mutation occupies an 'f' position
regardless of the numbering system used.

By functional analysis, Armel and Leinwand (2009), who also referred to
this mutation as H1901L, indicated that the mutant protein had decreased
thermodynamic stability. In addition, the extent of assembly of the tail
region was decreased compared to wildtype, and the paracrystals were
much larger and more stable than wildtype. The findings suggested that
the E1901L mutation alters the interactions between filaments such that
larger, more stable structures are formed. Similar results were observed
for R1845W (160760.0028).

In a family with CMH (192600) previously reported by Hengstenberg et al.

had a G-to-A transition in exon 15 of the MYH7 gene, leading to a
glu483-to-lys (E483K) substitution; 2 had a G-to-T mutation at codon
1096 of the MYBPC3 gene (600958.0014) and 2 were doubly heterozygous for
the 2 mutations. The E483K mutation was thought to affect a protein

In 3 affected members of a large consanguineous Indian kindred with
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600), Tanjore et al. (2006)
identified a G-to-A transition in exon 22 of the MYH7 gene, resulting in
an arg870-to-his (R870H) substitution in the rod region. The 2 affected
homozygotes had asymmetric septal hypertrophy without obstructive
outflow, and one of them died of heart failure at age 37 years. The
third patient was heterozygous for the R870H mutation and had
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with obstructive outflow. Analysis of family
members identified the heterozygous R870H mutation in 18 individuals, of
whom 10 were symptomatic. Tanjore et al. (2006) estimated the penetrance
of the R870H mutation to be 59% in general, whereas 75% of males and 44%
of females were clinically symptomatic, suggesting that female mutation
carriers have a better prognosis.

MYH7, GLU1883LYS

In a 44-year-old male with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and respiratory
failure (192600), born of second-cousin British parents, Tajsharghi et
al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a 24012G-A transition in exon 38
of the MYH7 gene, resulting in a glu1883-to-lys (E1883K) substitution at
a highly conserved residue in the distal end of the filament-forming rod
region. The proband had 2 similarly affected sibs who had died at ages
32 years and 57 years of cardiorespiratory failure; muscle biopsies from
all 3 sibs showed findings typical for myosin storage myopathy (608358).
The unaffected parents were presumed heterozygous carriers of the
mutation, and another sib was unaffected. There was no family history of
muscle weakness.

By functional analysis, Armel and Leinwand (2009), who referred to this
mutation as E1886K, showed that the mutant protein showed no major
differences in secondary structure or biophysical parameters from
wildtype. However, that mutant protein had a decreased ability to
assemble to the same extent as wildtype, and the paracrystals formed
were more readily degraded by proteolysis. The authors concluded that
altered packing of the filaments may destabilize them.

LAING DISTAL MYOPATHY
MYH7, THR441MET

In a Tanzanian boy with Laing distal myopathy (160500), Darin et al.
(2007) identified a heterozygous 1408C-T transition in the MYH7 gene,
resulting in a thr441-to-met (T441M) substitution in the globular head
of the myosin heavy chain. The patient had distal muscle weakness in the
lower limbs and mild atrial enlargement. Darin et al. (2007) noted that
most patients with Laing myopathy have mutations in the rod region of
the protein and suggested that the cardiac involvement in this child may
be due to the mutation affecting the globular region.

MYH7, LEU1793PRO

In 1 of 2 sibs with myosin storage myopathy (608358) originally reported
by Cancilla et al. (1971), Dye et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
5378T-C transition in exon 37 of the MYH7 gene, resulting in a
leu1793-to-pro (L1793P) substitution in the light meromyosin (LMM)
region of the myosin heavy chain tail. The sibs presumably had the
disease because of gonadal mosaicism in 1 of the unaffected parents,
although this could not be confirmed.

By functional analysis, Armel and Leinwand (2009) showed that the L1793P
mutation did not differ in protein secondary structure or in the
alpha-helical content compared to wildtype, but decreased thermodynamic
stability compared to wildtype. The L1793P mutation altered the ability
of LMM to assemble, presumably because of the increased instability of
the molecule. Although the paracrystals formed were similar to wildtype,
they were more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. The authors
suggested that the L1793P mutation destabilized the dimer interface
under conditions similar to those found in vivo, which affects the
ability of LMM to assemble properly.

In a mother with myosin storage myopathy who later developed
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH1; 192600) and in her daughter who had
early symptomatic left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC5; see 613426),
Uro-Coste et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for the L1793P
mutation in MYH7. The daughter did not complain of muscle weakness, but
clinical examination revealed bilateral wasting of the distal leg
anterior compartment, and she had some difficulty with heel-walking.

In 2 sibs with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-1 (192600), Arad et al.

substitution in the MYH7 gene. The proband had apical hypertrophy,
whereas the sib, who had sudden death at 45 years of age, was found on
necropsy to have massive asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with
an interventricular septal thickness greater than 30 mm and a posterior
left ventricular wall that was 18 mm thick. Arad et al. (2005) noted
that the D906G mutation had previously been identified by Ho et al.
(2002) in 22 affected members of a CMH family with a range of maximum
left ventricular wall thickness of 13 to 29 mm; none had apical
hypertrophy.

In a 40-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-1 (192600) who
presented with presyncope and was found to have apical hypertrophy, Arad
et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for an arg243-to-his (R243H)
substitution in the MYH7 gene.

In affected members of a 3-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant left ventricular noncompaction but no other congenital heart
anomalies (LVNC5; see 613426), previously studied by Sasse-Klaassen et
al. (2003) as 'family INVM-107,' Klaassen et al. (2008) identified
heterozygosity for an 814G-A transition in the MYH7 gene, resulting in
the R243H substitution. Noncompaction in all 4 affected individuals
involved the apex and mid-left ventricular wall, and the right ventricle
was involved as well in 2 patients.

MYH7, IVS8DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of 2 families segregating autosomal dominant left
ventricular noncompaction but no other congenital heart anomalies
(LVNC5; see 613426), 1 of which was previously studied by Sasse-Klaassen
et al. (2003) as 'family INVM-101,' Klaassen et al. (2008) identified
heterozygosity for an 818+1G-A transition at the splice donor site in
intron 8 of the MYH7 gene. The mutation segregated with disease in both
families; haplotype analysis ruled out a founding mutation. Clinical
evaluation in both families was remarkable for the very pronounced
morphology of LVNC. The proband of family INVM-101 was diagnosed because
of inverted T-waves and later had a stroke and systemic peripheral
emboli, whereas his brother initially presented with decompensated heart
failure and pulmonary emboli; both patients remained stable over a
period of 8 years. Other affected members of family INVM-101 fulfilled
morphologic LVNC criteria but were clinically asymptomatic. The proband
of the other family was diagnosed because of atypical chest pain; he and
his affected 8-year-old son had no signs of heart failure.

MYH7, ALA1766THR

In a 20-year-old man with left ventricular noncompaction but no other
congenital heart anomalies (LVNC5; see 613426), Klaassen et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a de novo 5382G-A transition in exon 37 of
the MYH7 gene, resulting in an ala1766-to-thr (A1766T) substitution. The
proband was initially diagnosed due to arrhythmias on routine
electrocardiogram, but his left ventricular systolic function
subsequently deteriorated over a period of 6 years; sustained
ventricular tachycardia resulted in implantation of an intracardiac
defibrillator. The mutation was not present in his unaffected parents.

In a 32-year-old African American woman with severe hypertrophic

Frazier et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a 1357C-A
transversion in exon 14 of the MYH7 gene, resulting in an arg453-to-ser
(R453S) substitution, as well as a heterozygous missense mutation in the
TNNI3 gene (191044.0003). Her affected 8-year-old daughter carried only
the heterozygous MYH7 mutation.

LAING DISTAL MYOPATHY
MYH7, 3-BP DEL, AAG

In affected members of an Italian American family with Laing distal
myopathy (160500) reported by Hedera et al. (2003), Meredith et al.
(2004) identified a heterozygous 3-bp deletion of 1 of 3 consecutive AAG
triplets in exon 36 of the MYH7 gene, resulting in the deletion of
lys1729 (lys1729del).

Muelas et al. (2010) identified the lys1729del mutation in 29 clearly
affected individuals from 4 unrelated families in the Safor region of
Spain. There was great phenotypic variability. The age at onset ranged
from congenital to 50 years, with a mean of 14 years. All patients
presented with weakness of great toe/ankle dorsiflexors, and many had
associated neck flexor (78%), finger extensor (78%), mild facial (70%),
or proximal muscle (65%) weakness. Five patients had cardiac
abnormalities, including dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular
relaxation impairment, and conduction abnormalities. The spectrum of
disability ranged from asymptomatic to wheelchair-confined, but life
expectancy was not affected. EMG showed myopathic and neurogenic
features, and muscle biopsies showed fiber type disproportion,
core/minicore lesions, and mitochondrial abnormalities. These findings
expanded the phenotypic spectrum of Laing myopathy, but the wide
spectrum associated with a single mutation was noteworthy.

Muelas et al. (2012) identified a common 41.2-kb short haplotype
including the lys1729del mutation in both Spanish patients from the
Safor region and in the Italian American family reported by Hedera et
al. (2003), indicating a founder effect. However, microsatellite markers
both up- and downstream of the mutation did not match, indicating
multiple recombination events. The mutation was estimated to have been
introduced into the Safor population about 375 to 420 years ago (15
generations ago). The region is located in the southeast of Valencia on
the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Muelas et al. (2012) hypothesized that
the families from Safor were descendants of the Genoese who had
repopulated this Spanish region in the 17th century after the Muslims
were expelled; in fact, many of the surnames of the Safor families with
Laing myopathy had an Italian origin.

.0045
LEFT VENTRICULAR NONCOMPACTION 5
MYH7, TYR283ASP

In affected individuals from 2 white families of western European
descent segregating autosomal dominant left ventricular noncompaction
(LVNC5; 613426), Postma et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
mutation at nucleotide 933 in exon 10 of the MYH7 gene, resulting in a
tyr283-to-asp (Y283D) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation segregated with disease in both families and was not found in
more than 980 ethnically matched control chromosomes. The 2 probands had
other cardiac malformations in addition to LVNC, including Ebstein
anomaly in both as well as type II atrial septal defect in 1 and
pulmonary artery hypoplasia in the other. One family had 5 more affected
individuals over 3 generations, 2 of whom had other cardiac
malformations, including Ebstein anomaly in 1 and perimembranous
ventricular septal defect in 1; 2 of the patients had only mild left
ventricular apical hypertrabeculation. In the other family, the
proband's asymptomatic mutation-positive father was found to have LVNC
by screening echocardiography; in addition, a paternal aunt was reported
to have heart failure, and the paternal grandfather had received an
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

LEFT VENTRICULAR NONCOMPACTION 5
MYH7, ASN1918LYS

In 4 affected individuals over 3 generations of a white family of
western European descent with left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC5;
613426), Postma et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a mutation
in exon 39 of the MYH7 gene, resulting in an asn1918-to-lys (N1918K)
substitution at a conserved residue. The mutation segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in more than 980 ethnically
matched control chromosomes. In addition to marked LVNC, the 39-year-old
proband exhibited Ebstein anomaly, which was discovered upon evaluation
of a cardiac murmur at 3 years of age. She remained asymptomatic despite
significant tricuspid regurgitation from age 30 years. She had a
mutation-positive son with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic coarctation
in whom echocardiography at age 5 years also showed LVNC. Her
asymptomatic mutation-positive mother and brother were both found to
have LVNC by echocardiography, and her brother also had LV dilation with
dysfunction. In an asymptomatic mutation-positive cousin, cardiomyopathy
could not be ruled out due to poor imaging quality.

606609	TITLE *606609 3-PRIME @REPAIR EXONUCLEASE 1; TREX1
;;DNase III
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The multistep processes of DNA replication, repair, and recombination
require the excision of nucleotides from DNA 3-prime termini. Enzymes
containing 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity remove mismatched,
modified, fragmented, and normal nucleotides to generate the appropriate
3-prime termini for subsequent steps in the DNA metabolic pathways
(Mazur and Perrino, 1999).

CLONING

By micropeptide sequence analysis of the 30-kD bovine Trex1 protein, PCR
with degenerate primers, and EST database searching, Mazur and Perrino
(1999) obtained cDNAs encoding mouse and human TREX1 and TREX2 (300370).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 304-amino acid TREX1 protein is 44%
identical to TREX2 (Mazur and Perrino (2001) corrected the TREX1
sequence to 314 amino acids). TREX1 contains 3 conserved exonuclease
motifs, with an HxAxxD sequence in the third motif. Functional analysis
confirmed that the 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity of the
recombinant protein is comparable to that of the native protein and
prefers mismatched 3-prime termini. Mazur and Perrino (1999) concluded
that the TREX proteins are small, independent 3-prime excision enzymes,
whereas the multifunctional p53 (191170) and WRN (RECQL2; 604611)
proteins, which also have 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity, are
much larger.

Using rabbit Trex1 to search an EST database, Hoss et al. (1999) also
isolated human TREX1, which they termed DNase III. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 1.15-kb TREX1 transcript in all
tissues tested.

Mazur and Perrino (2001) used 5-prime RACE to identify the flanking
region of TREX1. Genomic sequence analysis suggested that TREX1 open
reading frames are produced by a variety of mechanisms, including
alternate promoter usage, alternative splicing, and varied sites for
3-prime cleavage. RT-PCR analysis detected ubiquitous expression of
TREX1.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TREX1 gene contains a single exon (Hoss et al., 1999; Mazur and
Perrino, 2001).

MAPPING

Hoss et al. (1999) and Mazur and Perrino (2001) identified clones
containing the TREX1 gene that map to chromosome 3p21.3-p21.2.

GENE FUNCTION

SET (600960) and NM23H1 (NME1; 156490) reside in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex, the SET complex, that translocates to the
nucleus in response to superoxide generation by granzyme A (GZMA;
140050). Chowdhury et al. (2006) identified TREX1 as a component of the
SET complex. TREX1 bound SET and colocalized and translocated with the
SET complex. On its own, TREX1 did not damage intact DNA, but it acted
in concert with NM23H1 to destroy DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell
death. After NM23H1 nicked 1 strand, TREX1 removed bases from the free
3-prime end to enhance the damage and prevent DNA end reannealing and
repair.

Using mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis, Stetson et al. (2008)
identified mouse Trex1 as a protein involved in recognition of
interferon stimulatory DNA (ISD) BrdU-labeled intracellular
oligonucleotides. Microarray analysis showed that Trex1 was upregulated
in response to ISD stimulation. However, Trex1 -/- cells retained an
intact ISD response, ruling out Trex1 as the ISD sensor. In contrast
with Trex1 -/- mice, which succumb to lethal autoimmunity (see ANIMAL
MODEL), Trex1 -/- mice lacking Irf3 (603734), Ifnar1 (107450), or Rag2
(179616) survived and regained normal body weight through amelioration
of disease at discrete phases, indicating that TREX1 substrates are
ligands of the ISD pathway. Single-stranded DNA derived from endogenous
retroelements accumulated in Trex1 -/- cells, and Trex1 metabolized
reverse-transcribed DNA. Stetson et al. (2008) concluded that TREX1 is
an essential negative regulator of the ISD response and represents a
mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements.

Using mutation analysis with recombinant human TREX1, Fye et al. (2011)
found that arg174 and lys175 within the flexible loop and arg128 in the
catalytic core contributed to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) degradation. TREX1 degraded
endonuclease-treated hamster liver nuclei, suggesting that TREX1
contributes to apoptosis-associated DNA degradation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome 1

In affected members of 10 families with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(AGS1; 225750), Crow et al. (2006) identified 5 different mutations in
the TREX1 gene in homozygous or compound heterozygous state (see, e.g.,
606609.0001-606609.0004). One of the mutations, R114H (606609.0001), was
identified in 7 European pedigrees. Crow et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous mutation in the TREX1 gene (606609.0002) in a patient
originally diagnosed with Cree encephalitis, indicating that Cree
encephalitis is essentially the same disorder as AGS1.

Rice et al. (2007) described a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation,
affecting a critical catalytic residue in TREX1 (D200N; 606609.0006),
that resulted in typical Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, thus defining a
dominant form of the disorder.

Haaxma et al. (2010) reported a second patient with Aicardi-Goutieres
syndrome and a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation (D18N; 606609.0007).
The D18N mutation had previously been identified in heterozygosity by
Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) in a family with chilblain lupus.

- Susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome shows overlap with systemic erythematosus
(SLE; 152700) at both clinical and pathologic levels. Lee-Kirsch et al.
(2007) analyzed the TREX1 gene in 417 patients with SLE and 1,712
controls and identified heterozygosity for a 3-prime UTR variant and 11
nonsynonymous changes in 12 patients (see, e.g., 606609.0001). They
found only 2 nonsynonymous changes in 2 controls (p = 1.7 X 10(-7),
relative risk = 25.3). In vitro studies of 2 frameshift mutations
revealed that both caused altered subcellular distribution.

- Chilblain Lupus

Rice et al. (2007) reported a heterozygous TREX1 mutation (606609.0005)
causing familial chilblain lupus (CHBL; 610448), a rare cutaneous form
of SLE.

In affected members of the large 5-generation German family with
chilblain lupus in which the disease was mapped to chromosome 3p21-p14
by Lee-Kirsch et al. (2006), Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation (D18N; 606609.0007) in the TREX1
gene.

- Retinal Vasculopathy with Cerebral Leukodystrophy

In 9 families with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy (192315), Richards et al. (2007) identified 5 different
heterozygous frameshift mutations at the C terminus of the TREX1 gene
(see, e.g., 606609.0008 and 606609.0009). In expression studies, the
truncated proteins retained exonuclease activity but lost normal
perinuclear localization.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The TREX1 D200N and D18N dominant heterozygous mutations are associated
with AGS1 and CHBL, respectively. Using exonuclease enzyme analysis,
Lehtinen et al. (2008) showed that TREX1 heterodimers containing
wildtype TREX1 and either D200N or D18N mutant proteins were completely
deficient in degrading dsDNA and degraded ssDNA at an approximately
2-fold lower rate than wildtype TREX1. In addition, D200N- and
D18N-containing homo- and heterodimers inhibited the dsDNA degradation
activity of wildtype TREX1, providing an explanation for the dominant
phenotype of the mutant alleles. In contrast, the R114H mutation, which
causes AGS1 when present as a homozygous mutation and SLE when present
as a heterozygous mutation, had dysfunctional dsDNA and ssDNA
degradation activities as a homodimer, but it was functional as a
heterodimer. The R114H homodimer lacked inhibitory activity against
wildtype TREX1, supporting the recessive genetics of the R114H mutation
in AGS1. Lehtinen et al. (2008) concluded that the dysfunctional dsDNA
activities of the disease-related TREX1 mutants could account for
persistent dsDNA from dying cells leading to an aberrant autoimmune
response in these disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morita et al. (2004) found that Trex1 -/- mice developed inflammatory
myocarditis, suggesting a role for this enzyme in immune regulation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
TREX1, ARG114HIS

In affected members of 7 families of European origin with
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-1 (225750), Crow et al. (2006) identified a
341G-A transition in the TREX1 gene, resulting in an arg114-to-his
(R114H) substitution at a residue predicted to be involved in protein
dimerization. Five of the families were homozygous for the mutation and
2 were compound heterozygous with another TREX1 mutation (606609.0003).
Patient-derived fibroblasts showed no detectable TREX1 3-prime
exonuclease activity.

Lee Kirsch et al. (2007) analyzed the TREX1 gene in 417 patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (152700) and identified heterozygosity for
the R114H mutation in a European female patient who had nephritis,
arthritis, and antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies.

In an extensive study of the clinical and molecular phenotypes of
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, Rice et al. (2007) found biallelic mutations
in TREX1 in 31 of 127 families with the clinical diagnosis of the
disorder. Eighteen families, 14 of which were of northern European
origin, were homozygous (15) or compound heterozygous (3) for the 341G-A
transition (R114H). Notably, all R114H homozygotes were also homozygous
for the T allele of a SNP at position 531. This allele exhibited highly
significant (P less than 0.001) overrepresentation in patients compared
with controls (with a T allele population frequency of 0.4), suggesting
that R114H might be an ancient founder mutation.

.0002
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, ARG164TER

In a patient with Cree encephalitis, also known as AGS1 (225750), born
of consanguineous parents, Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
490C-T transition in the TREX1 gene, resulting in an arg164-to-ter
(R164X) substitution. A lymphoblastoid cell line derived from the
patient showed no detectable 3-prime exonuclease activity. The findings
confirmed that Cree encephalitis and AGS1 are essentially the same
disorder.

.0003
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, 3-BP INS, 600GAT

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with AGS1 (225750), Crow et
al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
TREX1 gene: a 3-bp insertion (600insGAT), resulting in duplication of an
aspartate residue involved in divalent cation binding within the
catalytic site, and R114H (606609.0001).

.0004
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, VAL201ASP

In a patient with AGS1 (225750), born of consanguineous Turkish parents,
Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 602T-A transversion in the
TREX1 gene, resulting in a val201-to-asp (V201D) substitution in the
catalytic site of the protein. Patient-derived fibroblasts showed no
detectable TREX1 3-prime exonuclease activity.

.0005
CHILBLAIN LUPUS
TREX1, 1-BP DUP, 375T

In a nonconsanguineous Bangladeshi family, Rice et al. (2007) found
association between chilblain lupus (610448) and a heterozygous mutation
in the TREX1 gene, the duplication of a single base (375dupT) that
resulted in a truncated protein missing the last 188 amino acids. The
mutation was present in 3 affected sibs; it was found also in a fourth
sib with a subclinical phenotype.

.0006
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
TREX1, ASP200ASN

In a child with a classic history of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(225750), born to nonconsanguineous Scottish parents, Rice et al. (2007)
found heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the TREX1 gene: a 598G-A
transition that resulted in a substitution of asparagine for aspartic
acid at codon 200 (D200N). Both parents had a homozygous wildtype
genotype at this position, suggesting a de novo occurrence.
Differentiation of the maternal and paternal alleles was possible
because of a frequently observed C-to-T SNP at position 531, which
allowed the authors to demonstrate that the mutation has arisen on the
maternal allele. A standard exonuclease assay indicated close-to-normal
TREX1 enzymatic activity. Rice et al. (2007) hypothesized that the
aspartic acid at position 200 of TREX1 represents one of 4 residues
essential for coordinating 2 magnesium ions involved in DNA binding and
catalysis, and that the D200N mutation represents a gain-of-function
mutation conferring altered substrate specificity, DNA binding, or
protein-protein interaction which would not be detected in a standard
TREX1 exonuclease assay.

Fye et al. (2011) stated that asp18 and asp200 are the 2 aspartates that
coordinate the divalent metal ion Mg(2+) at the TREX1 active site and
contribute to DNA binding and catalysis. They found that homodimers of
recombinant human TREX1 containing D200N or D18N (606609.0007) mutations
had negligible nuclease activity against ssDNA and dsDNA compared with
wildtype. Heterodimers of wildtype TREX1 with D18N or D200N TREX1
mutants had more modestly reduced ssDNA nuclease activity, but
profoundly reduced dsDNA nuclease activity, compared with wildtype
homodimers. Fye et al. (2011) concluded that the dominant phenotypes of
asp18 and asp200 mutations relate predominantly to impaired dsDNA
degradation and indicate that TREX1 dsDNA degradation activity is
fundamental to the prevention of autoimmunity.

.0007
CHILBLAIN LUPUS
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, INCLUDED
TREX1, ASP18ASN

In affected members of the large 5-generation German family with
chilblain lupus (610448) previously described by Lee-Kirsch et al.
(2006), Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 52G-A
transversion in exon 1 of the TREX1 gene, resulting in an asp18-to-asn
(D18N) substitution at a highly conserved residue critical for catalytic
activity. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
400 control chromosomes. Recombinant mutant TREX1 homodimers were
enzymatically inactive, whereas mutant/wildtype heterodimers had
approximately 40% of the activity of wildtype dimers, indicating that
D18N is a loss-of-function allele that does not exhibit a
dominant-negative effect. Compared to control cells, patient-derived
lymphoblastoid cells were substantially less sensitive to cell death
after treatment with granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) but not granzyme B (GZMB;
123910), indicating that D18N specifically interferes with GZMA-mediated
cell death in the caspase-independent form of apoptosis.

In a 16-year-old girl with relatively mild Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(AGS1; 225750), who was negative for mutation in other known AGS genes,
Haaxma et al. (2010) identified a de novo heterozygous D18N missense
mutation in the TREX1 gene. The mutation was not found in either parent
or in 200 control chromosomes. The patient also displayed features of
mitochondrial disease, with cytochrome oxidase-negative and ragged-red
fibers seen on histologic examination of the quadriceps muscle;
biochemical measurements showed decreased overall energy production (ATP
and CrP) in the presence of normal activities of individual respiratory
chain complexes, again compatible with mitochondrial dysfunction.
However, heteroduplex analysis of the entire mitochondrial DNA did not
show any mutations. This patient also had peripheral neuropathy with
prominent axonal loss and disturbances of myelination without strict
demyelination.

Fye et al. (2011) stated that asp18 and asp200 are the 2 aspartates that
coordinate the divalent metal ion Mg(2+) at the TREX1 active site and
contribute to DNA binding and catalysis. They found that homodimers of
recombinant human TREX1 containing D200N (60609.0006) or D18N mutations
had negligible nuclease activity against ssDNA and dsDNA compared with
wildtype. Heterodimers of wildtype TREX1 with D18N or D200N TREX1
mutants had more modestly reduced ssDNA nuclease activity, but
profoundly reduced dsDNA nuclease activity, compared with wildtype
homodimers. Fye et al. (2011) concluded that the dominant phenotypes of
asp18 and asp200 mutations relates predominantly to impaired dsDNA
degradation and indicates that TREX1 dsDNA degradation activity is
fundamental to the prevention of autoimmunity.

.0008
VASCULOPATHY, RETINAL, WITH CEREBRAL LEUKODYSTROPHY
TREX1, 1-BP INS, 3688G

In 5 families with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy (192315), including 2 North American families previously
reported by Grand et al. (1988) and 1 Dutch pedigree originally
described by Storimans et al. (1991), Richards et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (3688G) at the C terminus of the
TREX1 gene, resulting in a frameshift at val235 (V235fs). Haplotype
analysis suggested that these families were not related. The mutation
was not found in 192 Caucasian, 192 Chinese, or 300 Dutch control
alleles. In expression studies, the truncated protein retained
exonuclease activity but lost normal perinuclear localization.

.0009
VASCULOPATHY, RETINAL, WITH CEREBRAL LEUKODYSTROPHY
TREX1, 4-BP DUP, 3727GTCA

In a North American family of Chinese ancestry with autosomal dominant
retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (192315), previously
reported by Jen et al. (1997), Richards et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 4-bp duplication (3727dupGTCA) at the C terminus of
the TREX1 gene, resulting in a frameshift at thr249 (T249fs). The
mutation was not found in 192 Caucasian, 192 Chinese, or 300 Dutch
control alleles. In expression studies, the truncated protein retained
exonuclease activity but lost normal perinuclear localization.

606112	TITLE *606112 RIBONUCLEASE P, 14-KD SUBUNIT; RPP14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14), 20 kD (RPP20; 606113),
25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP14. The deduced basic protein has 124 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 14 kD. Immunoblot analysis showed
that antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP14 gene to chromosome 3p14.3 based on an
alignment of the RPP14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611558	TITLE *611558 UROPLAKIN 2; UPK2
;;UP2;;
UPII
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) forms the apical plaques of mammalian
urothelium and is believed to strengthen the urothelial apical surface
and prevent the cells from rupturing during bladder distention. The
major conserved integral membrane proteins of the AUM are UPK1A
(611557), UPK1B (602380), UPK2, and UPK3 (UPK3A; 611559).

CLONING

Wu et al. (1994) isolated AUMs from 8 mammalian species, including
human. Western blot analysis detected UPK2 at an apparent molecular mass
slightly lower than that of 15-kD bovine Upk2. Electron microscopy
revealed that AUMs isolated from cattle, dog, mouse, and monkey were
12-nm protein particles forming hexagonally packed crystalline patches.

Using murine and bovine Upk2 sequences as query, followed by RT-PCR of
human urothelial mRNA, Lobban et al. (1998) cloned full-length UPK2,
which they called UPII. The deduced 184-amino acid protein shares 87%
and 89% identity with the murine and bovine proteins, respectively.
RT-PCR showed that UPK2 was expressed at high levels in normal
urothelium and in moderately differentiated transitional cell urothelium
carcinomas. In situ hybridization detected UPK2 expression restricted to
the superficial cells of normal urothelium. No expression was detected
in any of the nonurothelial tissues examined.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the UPK2 gene to chromosome 11q23.3 based on an
alignment of the UPK2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB009454) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1.).

;;D-FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATE 1-PHOSPHOHYDROLASE;;
FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE, MUSCLE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (fru-1,6-P2ase, EC 3.1.3.11) catalyzes the
hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and
inorganic phosphate, thus providing a mechanism to permit the reversal
of the glycolysis reaction catalyzed by 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. See
the entry for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1; 611570), the human
liver FBPase. Tillmann and Eschrich (1998) stated that human liver and
muscle fru-1,6-P2ases appear to be distinct enzymes since they differ
significantly in their kinetic properties, and no reduction of
fru-1,6-P2ase activity was found in muscle in patients with hereditary
liver fru-1,6-P2ase deficiency (229700).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of skeletal muscle RNA with primers based on conserved regions
of fru-1,6-P2ases, Tillmann and Eschrich (1998) isolated a partial cDNA
encoding a novel fru-1,6-P2ase. Using a PCR strategy, they recovered
additional cDNAs which together corresponded to the entire coding region
of the gene. The predicted 339-amino acid muscle fru-1,6-P2ase shares
77% protein sequence identity with the liver enzyme. Recombinant enzyme
had fru-1,6-P2ase activity in vitro.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FBP2
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP sts-F16656).

MACROPHAGE GALACTOSE-TYPE C-TYPE LECTIN; MGL;;

CD301
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin family, such as
CLEC10A, recognize carbohydrate chains and are involved in host defense
mechanisms (Suzuki et al., 1996).

CLONING

By screening an interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)-activated peripheral blood
monocyte cDNA library with a hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (see
108360) probe, Suzuki et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding HML (human
macrophage lectin). The predicted 292-amino acid type II transmembrane
protein has a cytoplasmic domain with a tyr-glu-asn-phe (YENF)
internalization signal, a transmembrane domain, a neck domain, and a
C-type lectin domain (also called a carbohydrate recognition domain, or
CRD) containing a gln-pro-asp motif. Western blot analysis showed that
HML had an apparent molecular mass of 35 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Suzuki et al. (1996) indicated that HML bound
specifically to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine in the presence of
calcium.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the CLEC10A gene to chromosome 17p13.1 based on an
alignment of the CLEC10A sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC027858) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mgl1 and Mgl2 are mouse homologs of human MGL that have distinct binding
specificities. Westcott et al. (2009) examined the impact of
diet-induced obesity on inflammation and metabolism in mice lacking
Mgl1, a marker of alternatively activated macrophages. Mgl1 was not
required for trafficking of antiinflammatory type-2 adipose tissue
macrophages to adipose tissue. Obese Mgl1 -/- mice were protected from
glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and steatosis, despite having
more visceral fat, and this protection was associated with significantly
reduced inflammatory type-1 Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive macrophages.
FACS analysis revealed that Mgl1 was expressed on inflammatory 7/4(hi)
monocytes, and obese Mgl1 -/- mice had lower levels of 7/4(hi)
monocytes. Westcott et al. (2009) concluded that Mgl1 is a cell surface
receptor involved in the regulation of monocyte/macrophage activation
and trafficking to fat in obesity.

300793	TITLE *300793 CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGEN FAMILY 45, MEMBER A2; CT45A2
;;CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGEN 45, MEMBER 2; CT45.2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes upregulated in testis, followed by RT-PCR and
genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) identified 6 nearly
identical copies of the CT45 gene, designated CT45A1 through CT45A6, on
chromosome X. The CT45 genes appeared to be products of a recent gene
duplication. RT-PCR and EST analysis revealed 3 CT45 transcript variants
that differ in their 3-prime ends and represent the accumulated
expression of the CT45 genes. All 3 transcripts encode a deduced
189-amino acid protein that shares significant similarity with DDX26B,
SAGE (300359), and DDX26 (604331). RT-PCR detected high CT45 expression
in testis and variable expression in several cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that each CT45 gene contains 5 exons and
spans 8 to 9 kb. The first exon is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the CT45 gene
cluster to a 125-kb region on chromosome Xq26.3. The 3 centromeric genes
are transcribed in the centromeric-to-telomeric direction, and the 3
telomeric genes are transcribed in the opposite direction.

604065	TITLE *604065 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, T TYPE, ALPHA-1G SUBUNIT; CACNA1G
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-activated calcium channels can be distinguished based on their
voltage-dependence, deactivation, and single-channel conductance. See
601011. Low-voltage-activated calcium channels are referred to as 'T'
type because their currents are both transient, owing to fast
inactivation, and tiny, owing to small conductance. T-type channels are
thought to be involved in pacemaker activity, low-threshold calcium
spikes, neuronal oscillations and resonance, and rebound burst firing.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to calcium channels,
Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA encoding a
novel channel that they designated alpha-1G or Ca(V)T.1. The authors
used the partial cDNA to isolate additional human, rat, and mouse
alpha-1G cDNAs. Northern blot analysis of human and rat tissues
indicated that the alpha-1G gene was expressed as an 8.5-kb mRNA
predominantly in brain. An additional 9.7-kb transcript was also
detected. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the rat alpha-1G channel
exhibited the properties of a low-voltage-activated T-type calcium
channel.

Jagannathan et al. (2002) found that multiple isoforms of CACNA1G and at
least 2 isoforms of CACNA1H (607904) are generated by alternative
splicing and are expressed in testis. In situ hybridization localized
transcripts both in germ cells and in other testis cell types. Within
cardiac tissue, both CACNA1G and CACNA1H were expressed in vascular
tissue and not in myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By whole-cell patch clamp, Jagannathan et al. (2002) detected T-type
voltage-operated Ca(2+) channel currents in isolated round spermatids.
Currents were consistent with those generated by CACNA1H or CACNA1G
channels.

By action potential clamp studies, Chemin et al. (2002) found
significant differences in the biochemical properties of CACNA1G,
CACNA1H, and CACNA1I (608230) following transient transfection in human
embryonic kidney cells. Using firing activities recorded in dissociated
rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons and thalamocortical relay neurons as
voltage-clamp waveforms, they showed that CACNA1I currents contributed
to sustained electrical activities, while CACNA1G and CACNA1H currents
generated short burst firing. Chemin et al. (2002) hypothesized that
each of the T-channel pore-forming subunits displays specific gating
properties that uniquely contribute to neuronal firing and that CACNA1I
channels provide pacemaker activity.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) mapped
the CACNA1G gene to 17q22. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they
mapped the mouse Cacna1g gene to the distal portion of chromosome 11, in
a region showing homology of synteny with 17q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate whether T-type Ca(2+) channels in thalamocortical relay
(TC) neurons are involved in the generation of spike-and-wave discharges
(SWDs), Kim et al. (2001) used gene targeting to generate a null
mutation of CACNA1G that encodes the pore-forming subunit of T-type
Ca(2+) channels. The knockout mice grew normally and were fertile.
General development of the brain and major organs appeared normal. Using
pharmacologic models, Kim et al. (2001) analyzed the ability of mutant
mice to generate SWDs. The thalamocortical relay neurons of the knockout
mice lacked the burst mode firing of action potentials, whereas they
showed the normal pattern of tonic mode firing. The knockout thalamus
was specifically resistant to the generation of SWDs in response to
GABA-B receptor (see 603540) activation. Kim et al. (2001) concluded
that the modulation of the intrinsic firing pattern mediated by CACNA1G
T-type Ca(2+) channels plays a critical role in the generation of GABA-B
receptor-mediated SWDs in the thalamocortical pathway, the hallmark of
absence seizures.

Sensations from viscera, like fullness, easily become painful if the
stimulus persists. Kim et al. (2003) demonstrated that mice lacking
alpha 1G T-type calcium channels show hyperalgesia to visceral pain.
Thalamic infusion of a T-type blocker induced similar hyperalgesia in
wildtype mice. In response to visceral pain, the ventroposterolateral
thalamic neurons evoked a surge of single spikes, which then slowly
decayed as T type-dependent burst spikes gradually increased. In
alpha-1G-deficient neurons, the single-spike response persisted without
burst spikes. Kim et al. (2003) concluded that T-type calcium channels
underlie an antinociceptive mechanism operating in the thalamus and that
their findings support the idea that burst firing plays a critical role
in sensory gating in the thalamus.

609178	TITLE *609178 MIS12, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; MIS12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to yeast Mis12, followed by PCR of a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Goshima et al. (2003) cloned MIS12. The deduced
205-amino acid protein contains 2 conserved blocks in its N-terminal 100
amino acids, followed by a coiled-coil region of about 50 amino acids.
Endogenous HeLa cell MIS12 had an apparent molecular mass of about 25
kD. Immunolocalization showed MIS12 colocalized at kinetochores with
CENPA (117139) and CENPC (117141), and its position during the cell
cycle was that of a typical kinetochore protein. The level of MIS12 did
not fluctuate during the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, Goshima et al. (2003)
demonstrated that reduced MIS12 resulted in misaligned metaphase
chromosomes, abnormally extended metaphase spindle length, lagging
anaphase chromosomes, and interphase micronuclei without mitotic delay.
Spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 (601467) temporally localized at
kinetochores at early mitotic stages after MIS12 RNAi. Kinetochore
localization of MIS12 was unaffected by CENPA RNAi.

Following MIS12 overexpression in HeLa cells, Obuse et al. (2004)
immunoprecipitated MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex that
contained PMF1 (609176), DC8 (609174), C20ORF172 (609175), and HP1-alpha
(CBX5; 604478). ZWINT (609177) also associated with the complex at
kinetochores during mitosis. Immunoprecipitation of transfected cells
indicated that MIS12 could form stable complexes with C20ORF172 and DC8.
Much weaker interaction was detected between MIS12 and ZWINT. Exclusion
chromatography revealed 3 peaks containing MIS12 and C20ORF172, but only
the middle peak, which had a mass of 669 kD, contained HP1-alpha. MIS12
knockdown by RNAi abolished the kinetochore association of ZWINT, DC8,
and C20ORF172.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MIS12
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-36031).

;;O-LINKED N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINASE; OGA;;
O-GlcNAcase;;
NUCLEAR CYTOPLASMIC O-GlcNAcase AND ACETYLTRANSFERASE; NCOAT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The dynamic modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins by O-linked
N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) addition and removal on serine and
threonine residues is catalyzed by OGT (300255), which adds O-GlcNAc,
and MGEA5, a glycosidase that removes O-GlcNAc modifications (Gao et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening a meningioma expression library with autologous serum,
Heckel et al. (1998) identified 4 cDNA clones representing a novel gene,
which they designated meningioma-expressed antigen-5, with striking
homology to C. elegans hyaluronidase. MGEA5 was noted to have
hyaluronidase activity, but was otherwise not characterized.

By sequencing randomly selected cDNAs corresponding to relatively long
transcripts from human brain, Ishikawa et al. (1998) isolated an MGEA5
cDNA, which they designated KIAA0679, encoding a deduced 767-amino acid
protein. RT-PCR detected high MGEA5 expression in all tissues examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to bovine O-GlcNAcase,
followed by 5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA library, Gao et al. (2001)
cloned human MGEA5, or O-GlcNAcase. The deduced 916-amino acid protein
has an N-terminal domain of about 400 amino acids and a C-terminal
domain of about 350 amino acids that are highly conserved in vertebrate
and invertebrate homologs. The central region of about 150 amino acids
is highly variable. Northern blot analysis detected O-GlcNAcase in all
human tissues examined, with highest expression in brain, followed by
placenta and pancreas, and lowest expression in lung and liver.

Comtesse et al. (2001) identified a splice variant of MGEA5, which they
called MGEA5s, that includes part of intron 10 and has an alternative
stop codon and alternative polyadenylation signal. The deduced 677-amino
acid protein lacks the C-terminal acetyltransferase domain. Both MGEA5
and MGEA5s contain several possible phosphorylation sites,
N-glycosylation sites, and O-glycosylation sites. Western blot analysis
of a fractionated human glioblastoma cell line detected MGEA5 at an
apparent molecular mass of 130 kD in the cytoplasmic fraction, and
MGEA5s at an apparent molecular mass of 75 kD in the nuclear fraction. A
fraction containing membrane and cytoskeletal components showed the
130-kD protein. Toleman et al. (2004) identified a variant of rat Mgea5,
which they called Ncoat, that encodes a protein with the
acetyltransferase domain, but lacking the O-GlcNAcase domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao et al. (2001) demonstrated that COS-7 cells overexpressing human
O-GlcNAcase showed elevated O-GlcNAcase activity. Recombinant human
O-GlcNAcase displayed properties distinct from lysosomal
beta-hexosaminidase (see HEXA; 606869), with distinct substrate
preference and inhibitor sensitivity. O-GlcNAcase had a pH optimum of
5.7 to 7.0 and retained significant activity up to pH 8.0. It showed
strict substrate specificity for beta-linked GlcNAc, and it cleaved
GlcNAc attached to a test peptide.

Toleman et al. (2004) demonstrated that rodent Ncoat, when expressed in
a mammalian system but not in bacteria, possessed acetyltransferase
activity for a synthetic histone substrate, free core histones, and
oligonucleosomal substrates. Deletion analysis indicated that the
C-terminal third of Ncoat had histone acetyltransferase activity.
Toleman et al., 2004 suggested that NCOAT may play a dual role in gene
expression by removing O-GlcNAc modification from activators, while
adding acetyl groups to histones.

GENE STRUCTURE

Comtesse et al. (2001) determined that the MGEA5 gene contains 16 exons
and spans over 34 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the MGEA5
gene to chromosome 10. By somatic cell hybridization and FISH, Heckel et
al. (1998) mapped the gene to 10q24.1-q24.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forsythe et al. (2006) created a strain of C. elegans with knockout of
Oga1, the nematode homolog of Mgea5. Oga1 knockout altered serine- and
threonine-phosphoprotein profiles and increased GSK3B (605004) levels.
Mutant worms showed elevated stores of glycogen and trehalose and
decreased lipid storage.

188855	TITLE *188855 GRANULYSIN; GNLY
;;T-LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION GENE 519; TLA519;;
D2S69E;;
NKG5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GNLY gene encodes granulysin, a member of the saposin-like protein
(SAPLIP) family that is present in cytotoxic granules of cytolytic T
cells (CTSs) and natural killer (NK) cells and is released from the
granules upon antigen stimulation (Jongstra et al., 1987; Pena et al.,
1997).

CLONING

Jongstra et al. (1987) isolated 2 overlapping clones corresponding to
the GNLY gene, which they termed '519,' from a human functional
cytolytic T cell cDNA library. The deduced 129-residue protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 14.6 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a
900-bp mRNA that was also detected in functional T-helper cell lines,
but not in several T-cell tumor lines or other tissues. The findings
indicated that 519 expression is restricted to IL2 (147680)-dependent,
antigen-driven functional T cells. Expression of 519 was induced at
least 10-fold in peripheral blood lymphocytes by antigenic or mitogenic
stimulation.

Yabe et al. (1990) cloned GNLY, which they termed NKG5, from a natural
killer cell cDNA library. The deduced 145-residue protein began at a
start codon at position 129, with significant homology with the 519 gene
reported by Jongstra et al. (1987). A sequence comparison showed that
the 519 and NKG5 sequences were identical except that NKG5 lacks a
242-bp segment that is found in 519, and that this deletion leads to the
use of a different putative translational start codon and different
N-terminal regions. Unlike 519, the predicted NKG5 protein has a
putative N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting that it is a secreted
protein. In contrast, the 519 protein is hydrophilic and proposed to act
intracellularly. Northern blot analysis detected 40-fold higher
expression of the NKG5 transcript compared to 519 in NK and T cells.
Southern blot analysis indicated that both mRNAs are transcripts from a
single gene, consistent with alternative splicing. Yabe et al. (1990)
concluded that the 519 transcript results from a nonproductive splicing
event and does not encode a functional protein.

Houchins et al. (1993) identified many potential regulatory segments
within the 5-prime flanking region of the NKG5 gene, including AP1, AP2,
AP3, and SRE motifs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jongstra et al. (1987) identified 2 ATG translation initiation codons in
the 519 gene at positions 27 and 281: the latter at 281 was presumed to
be active, since the first ATG codon is followed by an in-frame stop
codon at position 69.

Houchins et al. (1993) determined that the GNLY gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Donlon et al. (1990) assigned the GNLY gene to
chromosome 2p12-q11.

GENE FUNCTION

Stenger et al. (1998) showed that granulysin is a critical effector
molecule of the antimicrobial activity of CTLs. Cytolytic T cells are
required for protective immunity against intracelluar pathogens such as
Listeria monocytogenes and Trypanosoma cruzi, which escape from
phagocytic vacuoles into the cytoplasm of infected host cells, as well
as Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, which are phagocytized by macrophages and remain localized
within phagosomes (Pena et al., 1997). An explanation for the functional
role of CTLs in immunity against intracellular infection was provided by
analysis of CTLs in tuberculosis (Kaufmann, 1988; Stenger et al., 1997).
These experiments suggested that CTLs that kill infected cells through
the granule-exocytosis pathway may release 1 or more effector molecules
with the capacity to kill the intracellular microbial pathogen directly.

Two subsets of CTLs exist, which differ in phenotype, cytotoxic effector
pathway, and antimicrobial activity. CD8+ CTLs lyse M.
tuberculosis-infected macrophages by a granule-dependent mechanism that
results in killing of the intracellular pathogen. In contrast, the
cytotoxicity of double negative CD4-/CD8- T cells is mediated by Fas-Fas
ligand interaction and does not inhibit growth of the mycobacteria. By
protein immunoblot analysis, Stenger et al. (1998) demonstrated the
presence of granulysin in CD8+ CTLs and the lack of granulysin
expression in CD4-/CD8- CTLs. Confocal microscopy of
granulysin-expressing cells showed a punctate pattern consistent with
granule localization. Furthermore, double staining of CD8+ T cells with
antibodies against granulysin and perforin (PRF1; 170280), a molecule
known to be expressed in cytotoxic granules, showed substantial
colocalization. Stenger et al. (1998) used recombinant granulysin to
test directly its antimicrobial activity against M. tuberculosis and
other organisms.

Chung et al. (2008) showed that blister cells from skin lesions from
patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermolysis
necrosis (TEN) (see 608579) primarily consisted of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes and natural killer cells, and that both blister fluids and
cells were cytotoxic. Gene expression profiling identified granulysin as
the most highly expressed cytotoxic molecule, confirmed by quantitative
PCR and immunohistochemistry. Depletion of granulysin reduced
cytotoxicity. In blister fluids, granulysin was in a 15-kD secretory
form, and injection of this form into mouse skin resulted in features
mimicking the skin necrosis. Chung et al. (2008) concluded that
secretory granulysin is a key molecule responsible for the disseminated
keratinocyte death in SJS/TEN. The findings also implicated a CTL- or NK
cell-mediated cytotoxicity that does not require direct cellular
contact.

601489	TITLE +601489 INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR-BINDING PROTEIN, ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT; IGFALS
;;IGFBP, SOLUBLE;;
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT; ALS
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT DEFICIENCY, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In vivo, insulin-like growth factors I (IGF1; 147440) and II (IGF2;
147470) are always complexed to one of a family of 6 IGF-binding
proteins, IGFBP1 (146730), IGFBP2 (146731), IGFBP3 (146732), IGFBP4
(146733), IGFBP5 (146734), and IGFBP6 (146735). Until birth, binary
IGFBP/IGF complexes of 50 kD predominate in serum, with IGFBP2 being the
most frequently occurring IGFBP moiety. In juvenile and adult mammals,
however, 80% to 85% of serum IGFs are found in a ternary complex of 150
kD composed of 1 molecule each of IGF, IGFBP3, and a protein that is
found only in serum, the acid-labile subunit (ALS). ALS migrates at an
apparent molecular mass of 84-86 kD. ALS retains the IGFBP3/IGF
complexes in the vascular compartment and extends the half-life of IGFs
in the circulation. Synthesis of ALS occurs mainly in liver after birth
and is stimulated by growth hormone (139250) (summary by Boisclair et
al., 1996).

CLONING

Dai and Baxter (1992) and Baxter and Dai (1994) studied the acid-labile
subunit of the rat IGF binding protein complex. Boisclair et al. (1996)
cloned and characterized the mouse Igfals gene.

Leong et al. (1992) isolated full-length clones encoding the acid-labile
subunit of the IGF binding protein complex from human liver cDNA
libraries by using probes based on amino acid sequence data from the
purified protein. These clones encode a mature protein of 578 amino
acids preceded by a 27-amino acid hydrophobic sequence indicative of a
secretion signal. Expression of the cDNA clones in mammalian tissue
culture cells resulted in the secretion into the culture media of ALS
activity that could form the expected complex with IGF1 and IGFBP3. The
amino acid sequence of ALS is largely composed of 18 to 20 leucine-rich
repeats of 24 amino acids. These repeats are found in a number of
diverse proteins that, like ALS, participate in protein-protein
interactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boisclair et al. (1996) found that the mouse Igfals gene contains 2
exons. Domene et al. (2004) stated that the human IGFALS gene contains 2
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the IGFALS
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP WI-7742).

Boisclair et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Igfals gene to chromosome 17 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Domene et al. (2004) described a 17-year-old boy who had delayed onset
of puberty, slow pubertal progress, and only minimal slowing of linear
growth in association with inactivation of the IGFALS gene caused by a
homozygous mutation (601489.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

To evaluate the importance of IGFALS and ternary complexes, Ueki et al.
(2000) generated mice in which the Igfals gene had been inactivated. The
mutation was inherited in a mendelian manner, without any effects on
survival rates and birth weights. A growth deficit was observed in null
mice after 3 weeks of age and reached 13% by 10 weeks. This modest
phenotype was observed despite reductions of 62% and 88% in the
concentrations of plasma IGF1 and IGFBP-3, respectively. Increased
turnover accounted for these reductions because indices of synthesis in
liver and kidney were not decreased. Surprisingly, absence of Igfals did
not affect glucose and insulin homeostasis. Therefore, Igfals is
required for postnatal accumulation of IGF1 and IGFBP3 but, consistent
with findings supporting a predominant role for locally produced IGF1,
is not critical for growth.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT DEFICIENCY
IGFALS, 1-BP DEL, 1338G

Domene et al. (2004) described a 17-year-old boy with delayed onset of
puberty and slow pubertal progress. Childhood medical history was
unremarkable, and psychomotor and neurologic development were normal. He
was first referred at 14 years of age for evaluation of growth pubertal
delay, at which time his height was 145.2 cm (2.05 SD below the mean)
and his weight was 35.9 kg. He was Tanner stage 1 for both sexual
development and pubic hair. Both testes were 3 ml in volume. Bone age
was 12.5 years. Growth hormone responses to provocative tests were
normal, but there was marked reduction of both IGF1 (147440) and IGFBP3
(146732), which remained unchanged after stimulation with growth
hormone. The acid-labile subunit was undetectable in the serum before
and after growth hormone stimulation. Sequencing of exons 1 and 2 of the
IGFALS gene revealed a 1-bp deletion, 1338delG, which involved 1 of 5
consecutive guanines at positions 1334-1338. This frameshift point
mutation resulted in the substitution of a lysine for a glutamic acid at
codon 35 (E35K) and the appearance of a premature stop codon at position
120 of the precursor form of the acid-labile subunit. The patient was
thought to be homozygous for the mutation; parental DNA was not
available because the patient had been adopted. After 6 months of
treatment with recombinant human growth hormone, reduction in the
subscapular skinfold thickness was observed but there was no beneficial
effect on either the velocity of growth or the serum levels of IGF1,
IGFBP3, and the acid-labile subunit.

.0002
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT DEFICIENCY
IGFALS, CYS540ARG

Domene et al. (2007) described a family with 3 affected sibs with
complete acid-labile subunit deficiency. The index case was an
adolescent male with delayed growth and pubertal development (Tanner
stage I, -2.00 standard deviation (SD) score for height at the age of
15.3 years) and poor response to GH (139250) treatment. Complete
sequencing of the IGFALS gene revealed compound heterozygosity for
mutations in exon 2: a 1618C-T transition resulting in a cys540-to-arg
(C540R) substitution on the maternal allele, and a 9-bp duplication on
the paternal allele (601489.0003). The index patient's affected brother
and sister carried the same mutations; a fourth sib carried the
duplication mutation. The 3 affected sibs had marked reduction of IGF1
(147440) and IGFBP3 (146732) levels, undetectable serum levels of
acid-labile subunit, inability to form ternary complexes, and moderate
insulin resistance. All of them attained a normal adult height that was
nonetheless lower than that of their heterozygous brother. The IGF
system was only modestly affected in the heterozygous carriers. Domene
et al. (2007) concluded that haploinsufficiency of the IGFALS gene has
no discernible clinical effects, with only modest impact on the IGF
system.

.0003
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT DEFICIENCY
IGFALS, 9-BP DUP

The 3 affected sibs with acid-labile subunit deficiency described by
Domene et al. (2007) as well as their unaffected father and brother
carried a 9-bp duplication, 583_591dup9, that predicted the insertion of
3 extra amino acids in the seventh leucine-rich repeat of IGFALS
(S195_197Rdup).

614758	TITLE *614758 DYNACTIN 4; DCTN4
;;DYN4;;
DYNACTIN, 62-KD SUBUNIT;;
p62
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN4 is a subunit of the 20S dynactin complex. The dynactin complex is
involved in microtubule-dependent vesicular transport, spindle assembly,
and cell division (summary by Karki et al., 2000).

CLONING

By gene dosage analysis and sequencing candidate genes in a YAC contig
covering the critical region of the 5q deletion syndrome (153550),
followed by database analysis, Boultwood et al. (2000) identified a
DCTN4 clone designated 605d01. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb
DCTN4 transcript in all 15 human tissues examined.

By mass spectrometric analysis of the 62-kD protein that affinity
purified with human dynactin, followed by EST database analysis and PCR
of an NT2 human teratocarcinoma cDNA library, Karki et al. (2000) cloned
DCTN4, which they called p62. The deduced 460-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 52.3 kD. It has an N-terminal domain with
11 cysteines, the last 8 of which fit the consensus sequence for a RING
domain predicted to bind 2 Zn(2+) atoms. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of an approximately 4.2-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.
Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that p62 had a punctate cytoplasmic
distribution as well as a centrosomal distribution typical of dynactin.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Ayalon et al. (2008) showed that Dyn4
colocalized with other dynactin subunits in adult mouse muscle fibers.
Dyn4 localized in a punctate distribution along costamere lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Karki et al. (2000) stated that p62 is present in the dynactin complex
at a stoichiometry of 1 copy per complex and that it localizes at 1 end
of the central ARP1 (ACTR1A; 605143) polymeric filament. Using
biochemical and immunoprecipitation analyses, they showed that p62
associated with the rat 20S dynactin complex. Recombinant human p62
bound immobilized in vitro-translated human ARP1. Overexpression of p62
in PtK2 porcine kidney cells did not disrupt microtubule organization or
the integrity of the Golgi, but it resulted in some p62 nuclear
localization.

ATP7B (606882) localizes to the trans-Golgi network, where it transports
copper to apoceruloplasmin (CP; 117700). When copper levels are in
excess, ATP7B redistributes to a vesicular compartment near the biliary
canalicular membranes, where excess copper is eliminated into bile.
Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library, Lim et al.
(2006) found that the N-terminal domain of ATP7B, which contains 6
N-terminal metal-binding sites, interacted with the C-terminal domain of
p62. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ATP7B, but not ATP7A
(300011), interacted with endogenous p62 in a human fibroblast line.
Depletion of copper reduced interaction of ATP7B with p62. Mutation
analysis revealed that the metal-binding CxxC motifs of ATP7B were
required for its interaction with p62, predominantly CxxC motifs 4
through 6. Lim et al. (2006) concluded that ATP7B is transported along
liver cell microtubules in a copper-dependent manner via interaction
with p62.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse heart cDNA library, Ayalon et al.
(2008) found that Ankb (ANK2; 106410) interacted with Dyn4. Protein
pull-down assays confirmed the interaction. Depletion of Ankb in adult
mouse skeletal muscle fibers disrupted costamere-associated
microtubules, concomitant with loss of costamere-associated Dyn4
expression.

MAPPING

By database and YAC contig analyses, Boultwood et al. (2000) mapped the
DCTN4 gene to chromosome 5q31-q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Emond et al. (2012) used exome sequencing and an extreme phenotype study
design to discover genetic variants influencing Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection in cystic fibrosis. Forty-three individuals with early age of
onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (all below the tenth percentile
of age at onset), and the 48 oldest individuals who had not reached
chronic P. aeruginosa infection (all past the mean age of onset) were
sequenced. After Bonferroni adjustment, a single gene, DCTN4, was
significantly associated with time to chronic P. aeruginosa infection
(naive P = 2.2 x 10(-6); adjusted P = 0.025). Twelve of the 43
individuals in the early extreme sample carried a missense variant in
DCTN4, 9 a phe349-to-leu substitution (F349L; dbSNP rs11954652) and 3 a
tyr270-to-cys substitution (Y270C; dbSNP rs35772018). None of the 48
individuals in the late P. aeruginosa extreme sample had either missense
variant. Subsequently, 696 individuals with varied CFTR genotypes were
studied. Seventy-eight participants were heterozygous and 9 were
homozygous for the F349L (614758.0001) mutation; 15 were heterozygous
for the Y270C (614758.0002) mutation; 1 individual was heterozygous for
both mutations. The presence of at least 1 DCTN4 missense variant was
significantly associated with both early age of first P.
aeruginosa-positive culture (p = 0.01, hazard ratio = 1.4) and with
early age of onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (p = 0.004, hazard
ratio = 1.9). The risk was highest in individuals with less selective
bias toward a P. aeruginosa-negative history, i.e., children enrolled
before 1.5 years of age and 103 enrollees who participated in the study
despite a history of P. aeruginosa-positive cultures. No significant
interaction was found between CFTR genotypes and DCTN4 mutations,
although power to detect such an interaction was low.

606119	TITLE *606119 SECRETED LY6/PLAUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; SLURP1
;;SECRETED LY6/UPAR-RELATED PROTEIN 1;;
ARS COMPONENT B;;
ARS COMPONENT B-81/S PRECURSOR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the leukocyte antigen-6 (Ly6)/urokinase-type plasminogen
activator (uPAR, or PLAUR; 173391) protein family share 1 or several
repeat units of the Ly6/uPAR domain that is defined by a distinct
disulfide bonding pattern of 8 or 10 cysteine residues. The Ly6/uPAR
protein family can be divided into 2 subfamilies. One comprises
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein receptors with
10 cysteine residues. The other subfamily includes the secreted
single-domain snake and frog cytotoxins, and its members generally
possess only 8 cysteines and no GPI-anchoring signal sequence (Adermann
et al., 1999).

CLONING

Adermann et al. (1999) reported the purification and structural
characterization of human SLURP1 from blood and urine peptide libraries.
SLURP1 is encoded by the ARS component B-81/s locus, and appears to be
the first mammalian member of the Ly6/uPAR family lacking a
GPI-anchoring signal sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Fischer et al. (2001) noted that secreted and receptor proteins of the
Ly6/uPAR superfamily have been implicated in transmembrane signal
transduction, cell activation, and cell adhesion.

The high degree of structural similarity between SLURP1 and the 3-finger
motif of snake neurotoxins and LYNX1 (606110) suggested that SLURP1 may
interact with neuronal acetylcholine receptors. Chimienti et al. (2003)
found that SLURP1 potentiated the human alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors (CHRNA7; 118511) present in keratinocytes. The authors
concluded that SLURP1 acts as a secreted epidermal neuromodulator that
may be essential for both epidermal homeostasis and inhibition of
TNF-alpha (191160) release by macrophages during wound healing. This may
explain both the hyperproliferative as well as the inflammatory clinical
phenotype of Mal de Meleda (MDM; 248300).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLURP1
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP X99977).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mal de Meleda is a rare autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized
by transgressive palmoplantar keratoderma, keratotic skin lesions,
perioral erythema, brachydactyly, and nail abnormalities. Fischer et al.
(1998) first reported linkage of MDM to a 3-cM region on the distal long
arm of chromosome 8, and Fischer et al. (2001) identified mutations in
affected individuals in SLURP1. Three different homozygous mutations
(82delT, 606119.0001; 178G+1A, 606119.0002; and C286T, 606119.0003) were
detected in 19 families of Algerian and Croatian origin, suggesting
founder effects. Moreover, one of the common haplotypes presenting the
same mutation was shared by families from both populations.

Eckl et al. (2003) analyzed 4 MDM families for mutations in the SLURP1
gene, which they designated LY6LS. In a large Palestinian pedigree with
multiple consanguinity, patients were homozygous for a novel
gly86-to-arg (G86R; 606119.0004) mutation. A different mutation
(606119.0005) in Turkish patients resulted in the same amino acid
exchange. Some remarkable similarities were seen in the clinical picture
of patients in these 2 families. Patients in an Emirati Bedouin family
had a homozygous alteration of the translation initiation codon of the
SLURP1 gene (606119.0006). In a German family with no known
consanguinity, Eckl et al. (2003) found pseudodominant inheritance.
Three affected children and their affected mother were homozygous for a
trp15-to-arg (W15R; 606119.0007) mutation.

EVOLUTION

Adermann et al. (1999) showed that a phylogenetic analysis based on the
SLURP1 primary protein structure revealed a closer relationship to the
subfamily of cytotoxins. Since the SLURP1 gene maps to the same
chromosomal region as several members of the Ly6/uPAR subfamily of
glycoprotein receptors, the authors suggested that both biologically
distinct subfamilies might have coevolved from local chromosomal
duplication events.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, 1-BP DEL, 82T

In 13 mal de Meleda (248300) families of Algerian and/or Croatian
origin, Fischer et al. (2001) identified a single nucleotide deletion
(82delT) in the SLURP1 gene, which was predicted to result in premature
termination at codon 32.

In 2 Tunisian women with Mal de Meleda, Mokni et al. (2004) identified
the 82delT mutation in heterozygous state. Both had mild palmoplantar
keratodermas, and one had interdigital fissures.

.0002
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, IVS2, G-A, +1

In 3 Algerian mal de Meleda (248300) families, Fischer et al. (2001)
identified a donor splice site mutation, 178+1G-A, in the second intron
of the SLURP1 gene.

.0003
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, ARG96TER

In 3 Croatian families with mal de Meleda (248300), Fischer et al.
(2001) identified a point mutation at nucleotide position 286 (C286T) in
the SLURP1 gene, which was predicted to result in premature termination
at codon 96.

.0004
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, 1764G-A, GLY86ARG

In a Palestinian family, Eckl et al. (2003) found that mal de Meleda
(248300) was associated with a gly86-to-arg (G86R) mutation arising from
a 1764G-A transition in exon 3 of the SLURP1 gene. See also 606119.0005.

.0005
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, 1764G-C, GLY86ARG

In a Turkish family with mal de Meleda (248300), Eckl et al. (2003)
found a gly86-to-arg (G86R) mutation, as in the Palestinian family they
studied (606119.0004); the nucleotide substitution involved the same
base but was a transversion, 1764G-C, in the SLURP1 gene. The patients
in the Palestinian and Turkish families had clinical features similar to
those in patients from the island of Meleda. Patients from both families
had the characteristic 'glove-and-stocking' keratosis. However, they did
not show any extension onto the knees or elbows as seen in 2 other
families, one German and the other Emirati Bedouin, studied by Eckl et
al. (2003). Similarly, nail involvement present in the Bedouin and
German families and in many of the Algerian families described by
Fischer et al. (1998, 2001) was absent in these 2 families. Patients
from both families had had severe fungal infections of the
hyperkeratotic skin.

.0006
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, MET1LEU

Eckl et al. (2003) found that mal de Meleda (248300) in an Emirati
Bedouin family was associated with an initiator codon mutation in the
SLURP1 gene. A 578A-C change in the genomic DNA was predicted to change
the initiator codon from ATG (met) to CTG (leu).

.0007
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, TRP15ARG

In a German family with mal de Meleda (248300), Eckl et al. (2003) found
that 3 affected children and their affected mother were homozygous for a
trp15-to-arg (W15R) mutation. They showed palmoplantar erythema with
pronounced keratosis extending onto the dorsal surface of the hands and
feet. The hyperkeratosis was most extensive in the affected mother. Nail
dystrophy with subungual hyperkeratosis was present in all affected
family members, most distinctively in 1 of the twin brothers. He also
showed hyperkeratosis with erythema on the knees. Perioral involvement
was seen in the affected sister.

.0008
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, CYS77ALA

In 3 women from a Tunisian family with Mal de Meleda (248300), Mokni et
al. (2004) identified a heterozygous cys77-to-ala (C77A) mutation in the
SLURP1 gene. All 3 had mild palmoplantar keratodermas, 2 had keratotic
papules, and 1 had interdigital fissures. The authors illustrated
cobblestone changes in the skin of the palm of one of the women.
Charfeddine et al. (2003) had described homozygosity for this mutation
in this family.

.0009
MAL DE MELEDA
SLURP1, CYS99TYR

In 6 Tunisian women with Mal de Meleda (248300), 5 of whom were from 1
family, Mokni et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous cys99-to-tyr
(C99Y) mutation in the SLURP1 gene. The authors illustrated cobblestone
changes in the skin of the palm of one of the women and a homogeneous
diffuse plantar keratoderma on the sole of another. Charfeddine et al.
(2003) had described homozygosity for this mutation in this family.

608536	TITLE *608536 GTP-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GTPBP3
;;MSS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; MSS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mss1 is a yeast mitochondrial GTP-binding protein that functionally
interacts with 15S rRNA. By searching an EST database for sequences
similar to Mss1, followed by RT-PCR using hepatoma cell line total RNA
and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Li and Guan (2002) cloned 5 variants of
GTPBP3, an Mss1 homolog. The variants are generated by alternative
splicing and through the use of alternate polyadenylation signals. Two
variants differ only in their 3-prime UTRs and encode an identical
492-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52.0 kD. Two
other variants encode an identical 471-amino acid protein, and another
variant encodes a 524-amino acid protein. GTPBP3 contains a typical
mitochondria targeting presequence, 2 GTP-binding domains, a p21 RAS
(see 190020)-like domain, and an SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain.
GTPBP3 shows extensive conservation of amino acid sequences with Mss1
homologs from several diverse species, including bacteria, yeast, and
nematode. Mouse and human GTPBP3 share 81% amino acid identity. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 2.6- and 1.9-kb
transcripts. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle, kidney, liver,
and heart, moderate in whole brain, thymus, spleen, and small intestine,
and low in colon, lung, and leukocytes. GTPBP3 was also expressed in all
individual brain regions examined. The larger transcript was more
abundant in most tissues. GTPBP3 colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
in transfected osteosarcoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Yeast cells carrying mutant alleles of Mss1 coupled with a 15S rRNA
mutation that corresponds to the 1555A-G mutation of human 12S rRNA
(561000.0001) fail to synthesize subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (see
516030) and manifest a respiratory-deficient phenotype. Li and Guan
(2002) found that overexpression of GTPBP3 complemented the respiration
defect of yeast carrying the Mss1 and 15S rRNA mutations. They suggested
that, like yeast Mss1, GTPBP3 may influence the phenotypic expression of
the 1555A-G mutation in 12S rRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li and Guan (2002) determined that the GTPBP3 gene contains 9 exons and
spans more than 6 kb. There are 2 putative polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li and Guan (2002) mapped the GTPBP3 gene
to chromosome 19.

605171	TITLE *605171 TUMOR PROTEIN p53-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 3; TP53I3
;;p53-INDUCED GENE 3; PIG3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DNA damage and/or hyperproliferative signals activate wildtype p53 tumor
suppressor protein (TP53; 191170), inducing cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. Mutations that inactivate p53 occur in 50% of all tumors.
Polyak et al. (1997) used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to
evaluate cellular mRNA levels in a colorectal cancer cell line
transfected with p53. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 were
expressed at levels more than 10-fold higher in p53-expressing cells
than in control cells. Polyak et al. (1997) termed these genes
'p53-induced genes,' or PIGs, several of which were predicted to encode
redox-controlling proteins. They noted that reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are potent inducers of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed
that p53 expression induces ROS production, which increases as apoptosis
progresses under some conditions. The authors stated that the PIG3 gene
encodes a quinone oxidoreductase homolog (see 123691).

MAPPING

By analysis of a BAC clone, Polyak et al. (1997) mapped the PIG3 gene to

The gene PIG3 is induced by the tumor suppressor p53 but not by p53
mutants unable to induce apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in
p53-mediated cell death. Contente et al. (2002) showed that p53 directly
binds and activates the PIG3 promoter, but not through the DNA element
described by Polyak et al. (1997). Instead, p53 interacts with a
pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence within the PIG3 promoter
(TGYCC)n where Y = C or T. Despite its limited similarity to the
p53-binding consensus, this sequence is necessary and sufficient for
transcriptional activation of the PIG3 promoter by p53 and binds
specifically to p53 in vitro and in vivo. In a population of 117 healthy
donors from Germany, the microsatellite was found to be polymorphic, the
number of pentanucleotide repeats being 10, 15, 16, or 17, and the
frequency of alleles 5.1%, 62.0%, 21.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. The
number of repeats directly correlated with the extent of transcriptional
activation by p53. This was the first time that a microsatellite had
been shown to mediate the induction of a promoter through direct
interaction with a transcription factor. Moreover, this sequence of PIG3
was the first p53-responsive element found to be polymorphic. Contente
et al. (2002) suggested that inheritance of this microsatellite may
affect an individual's susceptibility to cancer.

612825	TITLE *612825 SEC14-LIKE 4; SEC14L4
;;SEC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 4;;
TOCOPHEROL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; TAP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis of the region surrounding human SEC14L2 (607558),
followed by RT-PCR analysis of human lung total RNA, Kempna et al.
(2003) cloned SEC14L3 (612824) and SEC14L4, which they called TAP2 and
TAP3, respectively. The 406-amino acid SEC14L4 protein has a conserved
CRAL/TRIO domain and shares 80% similarity with SEC14L2. All 3 proteins
share residues glu185 and lys216, which are predicted to play a role in
phospholipid binding and transfer activity in S. cerevisiae Sec14.
RT-PCR of human tissues and cell lines detected high SEC14L4 expression
in all tissues examined. Immunocytochemical studies localized SEC14L4 to
intracellular membranes of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells, including
partial localization to the ER and Golgi, with more intense staining
surrounding but not within the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Kempna et al. (2003) showed that in HeLa cells deletion of the
C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain changed SEC14L4 localization
with decreased staining surrounding the nucleus and a more dispersed
staining throughout the cell. They suggested that the SEC14L4 GOLD
domain may play a role in docking to other proteins or in intracellular
transport of bound ligands. Using several assays, Kempna et al. (2003)
demonstrated that SEC14L3 bound tocopherol, squalene, and phospholipids
(phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol).
Although SEC14L4 bound phospholipids, it failed to complement an S.
cerevisiae temperature-sensitive Sec14 allele in yeast. Using
immunoprecipitation assays, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L4 may
interact with and regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and
that SEC14L4 displayed low basal GTPase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kempna et al. (2003) determined that the SEC14L4 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Kempna et al. (2003) mapped the SEC14L4 gene to
chromosome 22q12.1-qter, where it lies within 100 kb of the SEC14L2 and
SEC14L3 genes.

609988	TITLE *609988 PYROPHOSPHATASE, INORGANIC, 2; PPA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Inorganic pyrophosphates are generated as byproducts of many
biosynthetic reactions, including DNA and RNA synthesis, fatty acid and
amino acid activation, and cyclic nucleotide synthesis. Inorganic
pyrophosphatases (EC 3.6.1.1), such as PPA2, maintain the thermodynamic
favorability of these reactions by catalyzing the hydrolysis of
pyrophosphates into organic phosphates, which are then exported across
the cell membrane (Curbo et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases using PPA1 (179030) as query, Curbo et al. (2006)
identified PPA2. The deduced 334-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 38 kD. PPA2 shares about 60% amino acid identity with
PPA1, and it has a 31-amino acid N-terminal extension not found in PPA1
that functions as a mitochondrial import signal. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.4-kb PPA2 transcript in all 12 tissues examined, with
highest levels in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.
Fluorescence-tagged PPA2 localized with a mitochondrial marker in
transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Curbo et al. (2006) found that recombinant PPA2 hydrolyzed pyrophosphate
in vitro. The reaction was dependent on Mg(2+) and inhibited by Ca(2+).

GENE STRUCTURE

Curbo et al. (2006) determined that the PPA2 gene contains 12 exons and
spans about 100 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Curbo et al. (2006) mapped the PPA2 gene
to chromosome 4q25.

176875	TITLE *176875 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, CATALYTIC SUBUNIT, ALPHA ISOFORM; PPP1CA
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, ALPHA SUBUNIT; PPP1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein phosphorylation, a crucial posttranslational modification that
controls many diverse cellular functions, is dependent on the opposing
actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Protein
phosphatase-1 (PP1) is 1 of 4 major protein phosphatases identified in
the cytosol of eukaryotic cells that are responsible for the
dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in proteins. Although
all 4 protein phosphatases have overlapping substrate specificities in
vitro, they can be distinguished by the use of inhibitor proteins and by
their dependence on metal ions. PP1 is inhibited by nanomolar
concentrations of 2 thermostable proteins, inhibitor-1 (PPP1R1A; 613246)
and inhibitor-2 (PPP1R2; 601792), whereas the other 3 phosphatases (see
PPP2CA; 176915) are unaffected by these inhibitors. PPP1CA encodes a
catalytic subunit of PP1 that forms heterodimers with various PP1
regulatory subunits (e.g., PPP1R3A; 600917). These regulatory subunits
target PP1 to particular subcellular locations and selectively enhance
its activity toward certain substrates (Cohen and Cohen, 1989).

CLONING

Barker et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA encoding 1 isoform (PP1-alpha) of
the catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase-1.

Using 2 regions conserved within PP1 genes, Song et al. (1993) amplified
a partial PPP1CA sequence by PCR, and they screened a cDNA library using
this product to obtain a full-length clone. The deduced 330-amino acid
protein shows complete concordance with the rabbit protein. Northern
blot analysis revealed 1.6-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Genoux et al. (2002) demonstrated that PP1 determined the efficacy of
learning and memory by limiting acquisition and favoring memory decline.
When PP1 is genetically inhibited during learning, short intervals
between training episodes are sufficient for optimal performance.
Enhanced learning correlates with increased phosphorylation of CREB
(123810), of CAMKII (114078), and of the GLUR1 subunit of the AMPA
receptor (138248); it also correlates with CREB-dependent gene
expression that, in control mice, occurs only with widely distributed
training. Inhibition to PP1 prolongs memory when induced after learning,
suggesting that PP1 also promotes forgetting. Genoux et al. (2002)
suggested that this property may account for age-related cognitive
decay, as old mutant mice had preserved memory. They concluded that
their findings emphasized the physiologic importance of PP1 as a
suppressor of learning and memory, and as a potential mediator of
cognitive decline during aging.

Danial et al. (2003) undertook a proteomic analysis to assess whether
BAD (603167) might participate in mitochondrial physiology. In liver
mitochondria, BAD resides in a functional holoenzyme complex together
with protein kinase A (see 176911) and PP1 catalytic units, WAVE1
(605035) as an A kinase-anchoring protein, and glucokinase (138079).
Using mitochondria from hepatocytes of Bad-deficient mice, Danial et al.
(2003) demonstrated that BAD is required to assemble the complex, the
lack of which results in diminished mitochondria-based glucokinase
activity and blunted mitochondrial respiration in response to glucose.
Glucose deprivation results in dephosphorylation of BAD, and
BAD-dependent cell death.

In CT26 mouse colon cancer cells, Obeid et al. (2007) demonstrated that
anthracyclins induced immunogenic cell death by way of a rapid,
preapoptotic translocation of calreticulin (CALR; 109091) to the cell
surface. Anthracyclin-induced Calr translocation was mimicked by
inhibition of the Ppp1ca/Gadd34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) complex.
Administration of recombinant Calr or inhibitors of Ppp1ca/Gadd34
restored the immunogenicity of cell death elicited by etoposide and
mitomycin C and enhanced their antitumor effects in vivo.

Novoyatleva et al. (2008) identified a consensus PP1-binding motif,
RVxF, in the RNA recognition motifs of several splicing factors,
including TRA2-beta (SFRS10; 602719), SF2/ASF (SFRS1; 600812), and
SRp30c (SFRS9; 601943). PP1 bound directly to this motif in TRA2-beta
and dephosphorylated the protein, altering its interaction with other
proteins. Reducing PP1 activity promoted usage of numerous alternative
exons, including the inclusion of the SMN2 (601627) exon 7 in mice
expressing the human gene. Novoyatleva et al. (2008) concluded that PP1
has a role in splice site selection.

By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of PP1 complexes
in HEK293 cells, Lee et al. (2010) identified a complex containing PNUTS
(PPP1R10; 603771), TOX4 (614032), WDR82 (611059), and any 1 of the 3 PP1
catalytic subunits, PP1-alpha, PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590), or PP1-gamma
(PPP1CC; 176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1, had an
apparent molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it contains 1
molecule of each subunit. Mutation analysis revealed that human
PP1-alpha interacted with the RVxF motif of mouse Pnuts. PP1-alpha did
not interact directly with human TOX4 and WDR82. The PTW/PP1 complex
efficiently dephosphorylated the isolated C-terminal domain of the large
subunit of mouse RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro. The
PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout the cell cycle in HEK293 cells,
but its association with chromatin was regulated. PTW/PP1 associated
with chromatin during interphase, was excluded from condensed
chromosomes during early mitosis, and was reloaded onto chromosomes at
late telophase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Terrak et al. (2004) demonstrated the crystal structure at 2.7-angstrom
resolution of the complex between PP1 and a 34-kD N-terminal domain of
the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1 (602021). MYPT1 is the
protein that regulates PP1 function in smooth muscle relaxation.
Structural elements amino- and carboxy-terminal to the RVXF motif of
MYPT1 are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced reshaping of
the catalytic cleft of PP1, contributing to the increased myosin
specificity of this complex. Terrak et al. (2004) concluded that the
structure has general implications for the control of PP1 activity by
other regulatory subunits.

MAPPING

Barker et al. (1990) mapped the PPP1A gene to 11q13 by Southern analysis
of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization. Because of
evidence that PP1-alpha is a tumor suppressor and because of the
assignment to 11q13, PPP1A is a candidate gene for type I multiple
endocrine neoplasia (131100), which maps to the same area.
Translocations involving breakpoints at 11q13 have been observed in
lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B-cell type (see 151400),
and multiple myeloma. Other oncogenes or suppressors mapping to 11q13
include HST (164980), INT2 (164950), SEA (165110), and ST3 (191181).

Richard et al. (1991) described a high resolution radiation hybrid map
of 11q12-q13, which placed the PPP1A locus at the extreme end of a
cluster of more than 12 genes with C1NH (606860) at the other end and
with GST3 (134660) as its closest neighbor in the linear array. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Saadat et al. (1995) mapped PPP1CA
to human 11q13, rat 1q43, and mouse 7E3-F2. The results indicated that
PPP1CA is a member of a group of genes showing homology of synteny.

ANIMAL MODEL

Carr et al. (2002) noted that increased PP1 activity has been observed
in end-stage human heart failure. They developed a mouse model for
cardiac tissue-specific overexpression of PP1 by introducing PPP1CA
inserted downstream of the mouse alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter.
Overexpression of PP1 was associated with depressed cardiac function,
dilated cardiomyopathy, and premature mortality, consistent with heart
failure. Knockout of Ipp1 was associated with moderate increases in PP1
activity and impaired beta-adrenergic contractile responses. Expression
of constitutively active IPP1 in failing human myocytes in culture was
associated with rescue of beta-adrenergic responsiveness.

605578	TITLE *605578 INTERFERON-INDUCED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; IFITM2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 1-8 gene family, which includes IFITM1 (604456), IFITM2, and IFITM3
(605579), is highly inducible by both type I (IFNA (147660)/IFNB
(147640)) and type II (IFNG; 147570) interferons (summary by Lewin et
al., 1991).

CLONING

By screening a lymphoid cell cosmid library with a probe corresponding
to the 3-prime untranslated region of IFITM1, Lewin et al. (1991)
isolated a cosmid containing the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 genes, which
they termed 9-27, 1-8D, and 1-8U, respectively, within a single 18-kb
fragment. The predicted 132-amino acid IFITM2 protein, which is
approximately 90% identical to IFITM3, has an N-terminal signal
sequence, 3 potential phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal leucine
zipper. Sequence variability is greatest at the C terminus. Immunoblot
analysis showed that in response to IFNA, all 3 IFITMs were expressed as
14-kD proteins that could be further resolved by isoelectric focusing.

By whole-mount in situ hybridization, Lange et al. (2003) found that
expression of mouse fragilis, fragilis-2, and fragilis-3 was restricted
to the epiblast at embryonic days 5.5 and 6.5. By embryonic day 7.5, all
3 transcripts showed variable expression in a cluster of founder
premordial germ cells, and at embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5, all 3
transcripts were detected in gonadal germ cells. The 3 transcripts
showed unique patterns of expression in other tissues during mouse
development.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis of cells expressing IFITM genes, Lewin et al.
(1991) showed that IFITM2 was not as responsive to IFNA treatment as
IFITM3 or IFITM1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lewin et al. (1991) determined that all the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3
genes each contain 2 exons, with interferon-stimulated response elements
(ISREs) in the immediately 5-prime flanking sequence of the
promoter/enhancer region. Unlike IFITM1, which has an ISRE and 2 CCAAT
boxes but lacks a TATA box, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have 2 ISREs and no TATA
or CCAAT boxes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lange et al. (2003) mapped the IFITM2 gene
to an IFITM gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5. The order of the genes,
from telomere to centromere, is IFITM5 (614757), IFITM2, IFITM1, and
IFITM3, and the cluster spans about 26.5 kb. Lange et al. (2003) stated
that IFITM2 maps to the plus strand and that all other IFITM genes map
to the minus strand. However, Gross (2012) determined that, in addition
to IFITM2, the IFITM1 gene maps to the plus strand based on an alignment
of the IFITM1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000897) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

Lange et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Ifitm gene cluster to a region of
chromosome 7F5 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11p15.5. The mouse Ifitm gene cluster contains 5 genes, whereas the
human cluster contains only 4 genes.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Lange et al. (2003) found that only 2 mouse
fragilis genes, fragilis-4 (Ifitm5) and either fragilis (Ifitm3),
fragilis-2 (Ifitm1), or fragilis-3 (Ifitm2), have been conserved from
mouse to human. They suggested that subsequent gene duplications may
have occurred independently in both species.

604791	TITLE *604791 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 10; TAS2R10
;;T2R10;;
TASTE RECEPTOR, FAMILY B, MEMBER 2; TRB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R10 belongs to a family of intronless genes that encode highly
related bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). TAS2Rs are G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs), which are characterized by 7 transmembrane domains
(summary by Fischer et al., 2005). For further information on the TAS2R
gene family, see 604791.

CLONING

The gustatory system of mammals can sense 4 basic taste qualities,
bitter, sweet, salty, and sour, as well as umami, the taste of
glutamate. It had been suggested that the detection of bitter and sweet
tastants by taste receptor cells in the mouth may involve GPCRs. The
chemical diversity of bitter and sweet compounds leads one to expect a
large number of different receptors. Matsunami et al. (2000) used in
silico methods to identify a family of candidate taste receptors that
are members of the GPCR superfamily and that are specifically expressed
in taste receptor cells. In the mouse, the Prp (proline-rich protein)
gene locus is tightly associated with the SOA genetic locus, which is
involved in detecting the bitter compound sucrose octaacetate. The SOA
locus is on mouse chromosome 6, in a region that is syntenic to human
chromosome 12p13. The human homolog of the Prp gene (PRH1; 168730) was
found on a chromosome 12 contig. By searching the human chromosome 12
database with the sequence of V1R5, a candidate pheromone receptor,
Matsunami et al. (2000) identified an intronless gene encoding a
putative receptor protein in the contig containing the PRH1 gene. The
TRB2 gene (taste receptor, family B, member 2) encodes a 311-amino acid
protein with weak homology to the V1R5 protein. RT-PCR detected
expression of mouse Trb2 and Trb3 (604792) in the circumvallate and
foliate taste papillae, as well as the tip of the tongue, which contains
fungiform taste papillae, and the palate, which also contains taste
buds. Trb2 and Trb3 expression was not detected in the vomeronasal
organ, but appropriately sized PCR products were obtained from the
testis. In situ hybridization to mouse tissue showed that Trb genes are
expressed in taste receptor cells in both the circumvallate and foliate
taste papillae. Matsunami et al. (2000) concluded that the TRBs are
diverse in protein sequence, which is consistent with an ability to
detect a variety of tastants with very different chemical structures.

GENE FAMILY

Using the TRB2 sequence to search the chromosome 12 database, Matsunami
et al. (2000) identified 8 related genes, all in the same contig. Of the
8 TRB genes, 6 encode receptors related to TRB2 and 2 are pseudogenes.
Using these TRB sequences, Matsunami et al. (2000) were unable to find
any members of this family in either the NCBI or EST databases,
consistent with the idea that these receptors might be expressed
exclusively in taste tissue. However, Matsunami et al. (2000) did
identify the TRB7 gene (604796) in a contig assigned to human chromosome
5p15, the location of PROP (171200), the genetic locus that governs the
ability of humans to taste 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil, a bitter compound.
Matsunami et al. (2000) also identified 5 TRB genes (1 a pseudogene) on
3 chromosome 7 contigs, 2 of which are assigned to 7q31-q32. All TRB
genes have the 7 transmembrane domain structure characteristic of GPCRs,
but are unrelated in sequence to both mouse GluR4 (138246), which
detects glutamate, and the candidate taste receptors TR1 and TR2. In
addition, GluR4, TR1, and TR2 have long extracellular N-terminal domains
that are proposed to bind ligand, whereas TRBs have very short N
termini, suggesting that they use a different mode of ligand binding.

Adler et al. (2000) identified members of a family of 40 to 80 human and
rodent GPCRs expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue
and palate epithelia. These candidate taste receptors, which the authors
called T2Rs, are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically
linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. Each
T2R gene encodes a 7-transmembrane receptor protein. The amino acid
sequence identities between human and mouse T2Rs range from 46 to 67%.
The authors determined that a single taste receptor cell expresses a
large repertoire of T2Rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of
recognizing multiple tastants. In situ hybridization demonstrated that
T2Rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the
G protein subunit gustducin (see 139395), implying that they function as
gustducin-linked receptors.

Chandrashekar et al. (2006) reviewed the receptors and cells for
mammalian taste.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TAS2R10 is intronless (Matsunami et al., 2000).

MAPPING

Matsunami et al. (2000) identified the TAS2R10 gene on chromosome 12p13.

Adler et al. (2000) identified T2R10, which is identical to the TRB2
gene reported by Matsunami et al. (2000), in a BAC clone from 12p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Deshpande et al. (2010) found that bitter taste receptor agonists evoked
increased intracellular calcium in cultured human airway smooth muscle
(ASM) cells at levels comparable to GPCR agonists, such as bradykinin
and histamine. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected multiple TAS2R
transcripts in ASM cells, with highest expression of TAS2R10, TAS2R14
(604790), and TAS2R31 (612669), intermediate expression of TAS2R5
(605062), TAS2R4 (604869), and TAS2R19 (613961), and detectable
expression of 11 other TAS2Rs, with results normalized for expression of
ADRB2 (109690). Expression of 8 other TAS2Rs and TAS1R1 (606225) and
TAS1R2 (606226) was undetectable. Using isolated intact mouse airways,
Deshpande et al. (2010) observed dose-dependent relaxation in response
to bitter taste receptor agonists, such as chloroquine, denatorium, and
quinine, after challenge with contracting agents, such as acetylcholine
or serotonin. Magnet twisting cytometry showed that isolated ASM cells
challenged with histamine relaxed after treatment with bitter taste
receptor agonists. Bitter taste receptor agonists were a more effective
treatment than albuterol in a mouse model of allergic airway
inflammation. Deshpande et al. (2010) proposed that agents that bind
bitter taste receptors and cause bronchodilation may provide an
alternative and/or supplement to beta agonist for the treatment of
asthma.

POPULATION GENETICS

Kim et al. (2005) sequenced 24 human TAS2R genes in 55 unrelated
individuals of African, Asian, European, and North American Native
ancestry, and found a high degree of nucleotide variation. A total of
144 SNPs were identified with an average of 4.2 variant amino acids per
gene. In aggregate, the 24 genes analyzed specified 151 different
protein-coding haplotypes. Data analysis showed that the observed excess
of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions was much higher than expected
given observations in other genes. Kim et al. (2005) hypothesized that
natural selection may have been relaxed on these genes and that local
adaptation in human bitter taste receptor genes is common, driven by the
fitness advantages of avoiding toxins found in plants. The findings were
consistent with the view that different alleles of the TAS2R genes
encode receptors that recognize different ligands.

EVOLUTION

Parry et al. (2004) compared all human T2R genes with those of the
closely related primate species Pan paniscus (bonobo) and Pan
troglodytes (chimpanzee). Several of the great ape T2Rs have significant
differences from the human homologs. Most differences are at the single
basepair level, and some are identical to SNPs within the human
population. Moreover, some genes that exist in humans are pseudogenes in
the animals studied, and vise versa. Parry et al. (2004) concluded that
there is ongoing evolutionary diversification of T2R receptors and that
the variability in T2R receptors may account for dietary adaptation and
personalized taste perception.

Bitter taste perception prevents mammals from ingesting poisonous
substances, because many toxins taste bitter and cause aversion. Wang et
al. (2004) examined intraspecific variations of all 25 genes of the
human TAS2R family. Their data showed hallmarks of neutral evolution,
including similar rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN)
nucleotide changes among rare polymorphisms, common polymorphisms and
substitutions; no variation in dN/dS among functional domains;
segregation of pseudogene alleles within species and fixation of
loss-of-function mutations. Their results suggested surprisingly reduced
sensory capabilities of humans in comparison with many other mammals.
Wang et al. (2004) hypothesized that human TAS2R genes might be relaxed
from selective constraints because of dietary changes, use of fire, and
reliance on other means of toxin avoidance that emerged in human
evolution.

Fischer et al. (2005) stated that there are large T2R gene clusters on
chromosomes 12p13 and 7q31, in addition to the single T2R1 gene (TAS2R1;
604796) on chromosome 5p15. They sequenced the T2R gene repertoires of a
human and all extant ape species (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and
orangutan), as well as rhesus macaque and a baboon. Fischer et al.
(2005) found that the proportions of pseudogenes, and probably the total
number of genes, did not differ substantially among apes and humans.
Within the human T2R gene family, the sequence similarity between T2R
genes within the T2R gene cluster on chromosome 12 was higher than that
among the T2R genes on chromosome 7 (61% vs 47%, respectively),
suggesting that these genes evolved by tandem gene duplication and that
more recent duplication events occurred among the T2R genes on
chromosome 12 than among those on chromosome 7.
