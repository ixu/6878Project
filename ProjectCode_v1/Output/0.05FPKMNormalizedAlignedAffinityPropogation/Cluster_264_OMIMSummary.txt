DESCRIPTION Voltage-gated potassium channels play an essential role in controlling
cellular excitability in the nervous system by regulating a variety of
neuronal properties, such as interspike membrane potential, action
potential waveform, and firing frequency. These channels constitute an
evolutionarily related superfamily that can be classified into 2 groups,
the Shaker family and the ether-a-go-go (eag) family. The eag family
includes Drosophila eag, human EAG (KCNH1; 603305), rat Eag, Drosophila
eag-related gene (erg), human ERG (KCNH2; 152427), and rat Elk. Members
of the eag family are related to cyclic nucleotide-gated cation
channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, and plant
hyperpolarization-activated potassium channels. A common feature of the
C terminus of eag-type channels is a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding
(CNB) domain. By RT-PCR of human brain RNA using oligonucleotides based
on a rat Kcnh4 cDNA, Miyake et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding
KCNH4, which they named BEC2. The predicted 1,017-amino acid KCNH4
protein has 6 transmembrane domains, the pore region of voltage-gated
potassium channels, a CNB domain, and putative N-glycosylation sites.
KCNH4 shares 89% amino acid sequence identity with rat Kcnh4 and 48%
identity with human BEC1 (KCNH3; 604527). The authors concluded that
KCNH4, BEC1, and Elk form a subfamily within the eag family. Expression
of recombinant KCNH4 in mammalian cells induced a voltage-gated outward
current without a fast inactivation component. Northern blot analysis
and RT-PCR of human tissues showed KCNH4 expression only in brain; 4.4-,
7.5-, and 10-kb KCNH4 transcripts were detected on Northern blots.
Within brain, KCNH4 expression was restricted to the telencephalon. It
was predominantly expressed in the striatal regions, such as the putamen
and caudate nucleus, but was also expressed in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus. Miyake et al. (1999) suggested that KCNH4 is involved in
cellular excitability of restricted neurons in the human central nervous
system.
