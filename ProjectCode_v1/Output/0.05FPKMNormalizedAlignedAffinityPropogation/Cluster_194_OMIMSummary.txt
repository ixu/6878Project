300601	TITLE *300601 G ANTIGEN 7; GAGE7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many human tumors express antigens that are recognized in vitro by
cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) derived from the tumor-bearing patient.
The MAGE (melanoma-specific antigen) and GAGE (G antigen) gene family
members encode such antigens. To screen for genes associated with cancer
progression, Chen et al. (1998) performed differential display PCR using
sublines of the nontumorigenic, prostate-specific antigen
(PSA)-secreting cell line LNCaP that differed in androgen sensitivity
and metastatic potential. They isolated 2 members of the GAGE family,
GAGEB1 (300288) and GAGE7. GAGE7 encodes a 117-amino acid polypeptide
that contains 3 potential casein kinase phosphorylation sites, 2
potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, and 1 potential
N-myristoylation site. Levels of GAGE7 mRNA were not correlated to the
degree of tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cell lines.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2006) determined that GAGE7 is 1 of several copies of a
GAGE gene repeated on chromosome Xp11.23.

305360	TITLE *305360 MEMBRANE PROTEIN, PALMITOYLATED 1; MPP1
;;ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN p55; EMP55;;
PALMITOYLATED ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN; PEMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EMP55 is the prototype of a family of membrane-associated proteins
termed MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs). MAGUKs
interact with the cytoskeleton and regulate cell proliferation,
signaling pathways, and intracellular junctions (Kim et al., 1996).

CLONING

Ruff et al. (1991) deduced the complete amino acid sequence of a 55-kD
erythrocyte membrane protein from cDNA clones isolated from a human
reticulocyte library. This protein, p55, was copurified during the
isolation of dematin, an actin-bundling protein of the erythrocyte
membrane cytoskeleton. Its tight association with the plasma membrane
was reminiscent of an integral membrane protein. Protein p55 is the most
extensively palmitoylated protein of the erythrocyte membrane. Predicted
primary structure of p55 contained a conserved sequence, called the SH3
(src homology 3) motif, found in several other proteins that associate
with the cytoskeleton and are suspected to play important roles in
signal transduction.

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) found a gene located in a CpG island 30
kb 3-prime to the factor VIII gene (F8; 300841). The 2-kb transcript
encoded a previously described palmitoylated membrane protein, p55,
containing an src homology motif, SH3. Although originally described in
reticulocytes (Ruff et al., 1991), Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) found
that the transcript was expressed in a wide variety of human tissues.
The gene was also found in the mouse where it was expressed in all
tissues examined. The EMP55 gene did not appear to be developmentally
regulated in erythrocytes; p55 is constitutively and abundantly
expressed in erythroid cells during their development from stem cells to
fully differentiated reticulocytes. In contrast, other red cell
membrane-associated proteins such as 4.1, ankyrin, and band 3 are
expressed late in erythropoiesis. These results suggested that the p55
protein may have a housekeeping function. Other work indicated that it
is a peripheral membrane protein. Bryant and Woods (1992) demonstrated
that p55 is homologous to the yeast guanylate kinase and to the product
of a Drosophila tumor suppressor gene.

Elder et al. (1996) cloned and sequenced the mouse MPP1 gene. The mouse
gene shares 89% sequence identity with the coding sequence of human
MPP1. The coding region size and intron/exon structures of the mouse and
human genes are identical. The human and mouse sequences and structures
are highly homologous to the MPP1 gene of fish (Fugu), suggesting that
the gene serves an essential function in development.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse embryo cDNA library, Mburu et al.
(2006) found that whirlin (WHRN; 607928) interacted with p55. p55 was
expressed in mouse outer hair cells in long stereocilia that made up the
stereocilia bundle and in surrounding shorter stereocilia structures.
Since p55 and protein 4.1R (EPB41; 130500) form complexes critical for
actin cytoskeletal assembly in erythrocytes, Mburu et al. (2006)
proposed that p55 and whirlin may have a similar role in hair cell
stereocilia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) estimated that the EMP55 gene spans 20
to 30 kb.

Kim et al. (1996) reported the complete intron/exon map of the human
erythroid p55 gene. The structure of the p55 gene was determined from
cosmid clones isolated from a cosmid library specific for the human X
chromosome. There is a single copy of the p55 gene, composed of 12 exons
and spanning approximately 28 kb in the Xq28 region. Several of the exon
boundaries corresponded to the boundaries of functional domains in the
p55 protein. These domains include an SH3 motif and a region that binds
to cytoskeletal protein 4.1.

MAPPING

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) identified the EMP55 gene in a CpG
island 30 kb 3-prime to the factor VIII gene (300841). They confirmed
the Xq28 localization of the EMP55 gene by study of hybrid cell lines
containing various parts of the human X chromosome in rodent
backgrounds. They proved that the gene is located between the F8 and
glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; 305900) genes by hybridization
to a YAC clone that extends approximately 60 kb beyond the F8C gene. The
EMP55 gene appeared to be transcribed in the same direction as F8C. No
known factor VIII gene deletions extended into the EMP55 gene. Since the
function of the p55 protein was not known, the gene was formally a
candidate for any of the many disease genes that are closely linked
genetically to the F8C gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Metzenberg et al. (1994) failed to find evidence of mutation in the
EMP55 gene in either of 2 disorders that on the grounds of phenotype and
map location are candidate disorders: dyskeratosis congenita (305000)
and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300).

Liu et al. (1997) reported a method of determination of clonality using
allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) to detect exonic polymorphisms in p55 and
G6PD (305900). They demonstrated a significant sex difference in allele
frequencies in African Americans but not in Caucasians, and linkage
disequilibrium for the p55 and G6PD alleles in Caucasians but not in
African Americans.

601805	TITLE *601805 G PROTEIN-COUPLED ESTROGEN RECEPTOR; GPER
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 30; GPR30;;
CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR-LIKE 2; CMKRL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Owman et al. (1996) performed PCR of template DNA from human B-cell
lymphoblasts using degenerate primers to G protein-coupled receptors.
They identified a full-length cDNA encoding a 375-amino acid protein,
which they termed CMKRL2. CMKRL2 is expressed in the Burkitt lymphoma
cell lines Raji and Daudi but not in T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells, T- or
B-cell leukemias, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or other cancer cell
lines (Owman et al., 1996). Northern blot analysis of normal tissue
showed expression of a 2.4-kb transcript in many tissues including the
brain; there was no detectable mRNA in placenta, bone marrow, or
peripheral blood leukocytes (Owman et al., 1996).

Using the technique of differential cDNA library screening to identify
genes overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ESR)-positive breast carcinoma
cell lines compared to ESR-negative cell lines, Carmeci et al. (1997)
isolated a CMKRL2 cDNA and designated it GPR30. Sequence analysis
determined that the clone shares significant homology to G
protein-coupled receptors. This receptor was abundantly expressed in 3
ESR-positive breast carcinoma cell lines. Expression was absent or
minimal in 3 ESR-negative breast carcinoma cell lines. It was
ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues examined, but was most
abundant in placenta. In 11 primary breast carcinomas, it was detected
in all 4 ESR-positive tumors and in only 1 of 7 ESR-negative tumors. The
pattern of expression of the gene indicated that the receptor may be
involved in physiologic responses specific to hormonally responsive
tissues.

Using PCR with degenerate primers to identify novel members of the G
protein-coupled receptor family, Feng and Gregor (1997) also cloned
GPR30. They designated the gene CEPR for 'constitutively/commonly
expressed peptide-like receptor' because the 3.3-kb mRNA was detected in
most human tissues on Northern blots. They found that CEPR is encoded by
an intronless gene. Similarly, Kvingedal and Smeland (1997) cloned GPR30
using RT-PCR of B-cell mRNA to identify G protein-coupled receptors
expressed in lymphocytes. They designated the gene LyGPR for
'lymphocyte-derived G protein-coupled receptor.' Takada et al. (1997)
cloned GPR30 from endothelial cells exposed to fluid shear stress. They
designated the gene FEG1 for 'flow-induced endothelial G protein-coupled
receptor gene-1.'

GENE FUNCTION

Revankar et al. (2005) found that unlike other known G protein-coupled
receptors, GPR30 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it
specifically binds estrogen and estrogen derivatives. Activating GPR30
by estrogen resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization and synthesis
of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the nucleus. Revankar et
al. (2005) concluded that GPR30 represents an intracellular
transmembrane estrogen receptor that may contribute to normal estrogen
physiology as well as pathophysiology. Pietras et al. (2005) questioned
the conclusions raised by Revankar et al. (2005); Prossnitz et al.
(2005) provided a response.

MAPPING

Owman et al. (1996) mapped the CMKRL2 gene to 7p22 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Based upon PCR analysis in somatic hybrid cell
lines, Carmeci et al. (1997) mapped the GPR30 gene to 7p22.

612870	TITLE *612870 PLECKSTRIN HOMOLOGY DOMAIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN; PHIP
;;DDB1- AND CUL4-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 14; DCAF14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PHIP binds the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545), modulates insulin signaling, and plays a
role in pancreatic beta cell growth and survival (Farhang-Fallah et al.,
2000; Podcheko et al., 2007).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 10.5 day embryo cDNA library
using the rat Irs1 PH domain as bait, followed by screening mouse thymus
and human fetal brain cDNA libraries, Farhang-Fallah et al. (2000)
identified mouse and human PHIP. The deduced 902-amino acid mouse and
human proteins have a calculated molecular mass of 100 kD. Both have 2
predicted bromodomains that share 44% identity with the bromodomain of
mouse CREB-binding protein (CREBBP; 600140). Northern blot analysis of
adult mouse tissues detected a 7.0-kb transcript with widespread
expression. Western blot analysis of human myeloma cell lysates detected
a long 104-kD isoform and a shorter 97-kD isoform, which were predicted
to arise from alternative usage of 2 putative translation initiation
sites.

By database analysis, Podcheko et al. (2007) identified a 206-kD mouse
Phip isoform in pancreatic beta cells. By RT-PCR of MCF-7 cells, they
cloned a long isoform of human PHIP, which they called PHIP1. Human
PHIP1 shares 96% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. The
1,821-amino acid PHIP1 isoform has a predicted molecular mass of 206 kD
and contains 8 predicted WD40 repeats, 2 bromodomains, and 2 putative
nuclear localization signals. Quantitative PCR analysis detected mouse
Phip1 mRNA in all tissues examined, with highest expression in
pancreatic islets, brain, and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence
studies localized Phip1 to the nucleus in mouse pancreatic islet cells,
which contain higher Phip1 expression than the surrounding acinar cells.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the PHIP gene to chromosome 6q14.1 based on an
alignment of the PHIP sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF310250) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Farhang-Fallah et al. (2000) used GST-fusion assay to demonstrate that
mouse Phip interacted specifically with the IRS1 PH domain and failed to
interact with PH domains from other proteins. Immunoprecipitation
studies detected interaction between endogenous mouse Phip and the IRS1
PH domain in both unstimulated and insulin-treated NIH3T3 cells
overexpressing the insulin receptor (INSR; 147670). Binding competition
analysis showed that the PHIP PH-binding region disrupted IRS1 tyrosine
phosphorylation, as well as insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity.
Farhang-Fallah et al. (2000) concluded that PHIP is a protein ligand of
the IRS1 PH domain that can modulate insulin signaling.

Podcheko et al. (2007) determined that Phip1 potentiates IGF1 (IGF1;
147440) stimulated mitogenesis in pancreatic beta cells. In addition,
Phip1 induced transcriptional activation of the cyclin D2 (CCND2;
123833) promoter in a luciferase reporter assay. RNAi knockdown resulted
in inhibition of IRS2 (600797)-dependent mitogenesis. Inhibition of PKB
(AKT1; 164730) activity blocked the protective effect of Phip1 on free
fatty acid-induced apoptosis. Phip1 overexpression inhibited the
induction of apoptosis, induced PKB phosphorylation, and inhibited
caspase-9 (CASP9; 602234) and caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) activation.
Podcheko et al. (2007) concluded that Phip1 plays a role in regulation
of pancreatic beta cell growth and survival.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of mutation in the PHIP gene as a possible cause of an
intellectual disability phenotype, see 612870.0001.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
PHIP, TYR1149TER

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to an intellectual disability phenotype has not been
confirmed.

In a girl with moderate gross motor delays and severe speech delays,
macrocephaly, dysmorphic features including straight eyebrows,
strabismus, blepharophimosis, ptosis, a long philtrum and full lips,
tapered fingers, clinodactyly of fifth fingers, long toes, and a normal
brain on MRI, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
3447T-G transversion, resulting in a tyr1149-to-ter (Y1149X)
substitution.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the sequences of EXT1 (608177), EXT2
(608210), and EXTL1 (601738), followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE,
Saito et al. (1998) cloned full-length cDNAs for 2 new members of the
EXT family, EXTL2 (602411) and EXTL3, which they called EXTR2 and EXTR1,
respectively. The deduced 919-amino acid EXTL3 protein contains a highly
conserved region in the C terminus common to other EXT proteins.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of 6.2- and 4.7-kb EXTR1
transcripts in all tissues tested except ovary. The larger transcript
was predominant in brain, skeletal muscle, and testis, and the shorter
transcript in heart, liver, thymus, and prostate.

Kobayashi et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA for a REG protein (see 167770)
receptor from a rat islet cDNA library. Cells into which the cDNA had
been introduced bound REG protein with high affinity. When the cDNA was
introduced into a pancreatic beta-cell line that showed REG-dependent
growth, the transformants exhibited a significant increase in the
incorporation of 5-prime-bromo-2-prime-deoxyuridine as well as in the
cell numbers in response to REG protein. A homology search revealed that
the rat REG protein receptor cDNA is a homolog of EXTL3. The rat and
human proteins share 97% sequence identity. Kobayashi et al. (2000)
found that REG receptor mRNA in the rat is detectable in liver, kidney,
stomach, small intestine, colon, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, and
brain, but not in heart, suggesting the possible involvement of the
REG-REG protein receptor signal system in a variety of cell types other
than pancreatic beta cells.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Saito et al.
(1998) mapped the human EXTL3 gene to chromosome 8p21. By FISH,
radiation hybrid analysis, and inclusion within a mapped contig, Van Hul
et al. (1998) mapped the gene to 8p21-p12.

611191	TITLE *611191 MICRO RNA 125A; MIR125A
;;MIRN125A;;
miRNA125A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN125A, are small noncoding RNAs that
control translation of target mRNAs by binding to sites of antisense
complementarity in 3-prime UTRs (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002).

CLONING

Lagos-Quintana et al. (2002) cloned mouse miRNA125a. Mouse miRNA125a and
miRNA125b (see 610105) differ only by a central diuridine insertion and
a U-to-C change in miRNA125a. Both miRNAs are similar to the C. elegans
lin-4 small temporal RNA. Northern blot analysis detected miRNA125a
expression in all mouse brain regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Laneve et al. (2007) found that MIRN9 (see 611186), MIRN125A, and
MIRN125B were upregulated in a human neuroblastoma cell line by retinoic
acid. They identified the mRNA encoding t-NTRK3, a truncated isoform of
NTRK3 (191316), as a target of the 3 miRNAs. The 3-prime UTR of the
t-NTRK3 transcript has a binding site for MIRN9 and another for both
MIRN125A and MIRN125B, which share the same seed sequence. These miRNAs
repressed t-NTRK3 expression in an additive manner, and downregulation
of t-NTRK3 was critical for regulating neuroblastoma cell growth.
Consistent with their function, MIRN9, MIRN125A, and MIRN125B were
downmodulated in primary neuroblastoma tumors.

MAPPING

Duan et al. (2007) stated that the MIR125A gene maps to chromosome
19q13.41.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By searching a human SNP database, Duan et al. (2007) identified a
G-to-U SNP at nucleotide +8 (+8G-U) in the mature MIR125A sequence.
Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of transfected HEK293
cells detected the mature form of the major +8G allele of MIR125A, but
not the mature form of the minor +8U allele. The +8G-U SNP was predicted
to introduce a base-pairing mismatch, alter free energy values, and
create an enlarged RNA bulge in pri-MIR125A. In vivo analysis showed
that +8G-U blocked processing of pri-MIR125A to pre-MIR125A. Expression
of a vector containing MIR125A +8G, but not MIR125A +8U, could suppress
a MIR125A target reporter, LIN28 (611043). Duan et al. (2007) concluded
that the +8G-U SNP alters MIR125A processing and reduces
MIR125A-mediated translational suppression.

300512	TITLE *300512 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 13; WDR13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human testis cDNA library, Singh et al. (2003) cloned
WDR13. The deduced 485-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 53 kD. The N-terminal domain of WDR13 contains several consensus
phosphorylation sites, and the C terminus contains 6 WD repeats. Singh
et al. (2003) also identified a splice variant that encodes a 393-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of transcripts at about 3.0 and
2.0 kb in all tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis confirmed
widespread expression in adult and fetal tissues. Transfection of the
WDR13 splice variants in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated
expression of the 53-kD isoform in the nucleus and expression of the
43-kD isoform in both cytoplasm and nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Singh et al. (2003) determined that the WDR13 gene contains 9 exons and
spans 7.3 kb. The promoter region contains a GC box and binding sites
for AP1 (see JUN, 165160), SP1 (189906), and GATA1 (305371).

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Singh et al. (2003) mapped the
WDR13 gene to chromosome Xp11.23.

613358	TITLE *613358 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 16 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH16A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins that coimmunoprecipitated
with maspardin (ACP33; 608181) from HeLa cell lysates, followed by
database analysis, Hanna and Blackstone (2009) identified ALDH16A1.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected a punctate cytoplasmic ALDH16A1
distribution in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis showed that the
protein had an apparent molecular mass of 85 kD. RT-PCR detected
Aldh16a1 in mouse brain. In situ hybridization of cultured mouse
cortical neurons revealed prominent punctate Aldh16a1 staining in cell
bodies and growth cones.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays, Hanna
and Blackstone (2009) showed that endogenous maspardin and ALDH16A1
interacted directly.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ALDH16A1 gene to chromosome 19q13.33 based on an
alignment of the ALDH16A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY007096) with the
genomic sequence (GRCH37).

605565	TITLE *605565 RESISTIN; RETN
;;RSTN;;
FOUND IN INFLAMMATORY ZONE 3; FIZZ3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching sequence databases for genes similar to mouse Fizz1,
Holcomb et al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding human FIZZ2 (RETNLB;
605645), which the authors incorrectly called FIZZ1, and human and mouse
FIZZ3 (RETN). The deduced 108-amino acid FIZZ3 protein, 53% identical to
mouse Fizz3 and 47% identical to human FIZZ2, shares an N-terminal
signal peptide and a C-terminal stretch of 10 cysteine residues with
identical spacing with the other FIZZ family members. In situ
hybridization analysis detected diffuse expression of mouse Fizz3 in
white but not brown adipose tissue in a variety of organs.

GENE FUNCTION

Type II diabetes (125853), characterized by target-tissue resistance to
insulin (176730), is epidemic in industrialized societies and is
strongly associated with obesity. Steppan et al. (2001) studied the
mechanism by which increased adiposity causes insulin resistance. They
demonstrated that adipocytes secrete a unique signaling molecule, which
they called resistin (for resistance to insulin), that may be the
hormone potentially linking obesity to diabetes. Steppan et al. (2001)
identified resistin, which is identical to FIZZ3, by screening for genes
that are induced during adipocyte differentiation but downregulated in
mature adipocytes exposed to thiazolidinediones (TZD),
insulin-secreting, antidiabetic drugs that interact with the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Resistin gene
expression is induced during adipocyte differentiation, and the resistin
polypeptide is specifically expressed and secreted by adipocytes.
Resistin circulates in mouse serum, and its level is increased markedly
in both genetic and diet-induced obesity. Immunoneutralization improves
blood glucose and insulin action in this model of type II diabetes. By
contrast, administration of resistin impairs glucose tolerance and
insulin action in normal mice. In mouse, a single mRNA of roughly 750
residues is robustly expressed in white adipose tissue but not in
several other mouse tissues. Resistin expression is greater in white
adipose tissue than in brown adipose tissue, where resistin mRNA is
barely detectable. Resistin mRNA levels varied as a function of white
adipose depot and gender, with the highest level of expression in female
gonadal fat. Immunohistochemistry of epididymal white adipose tissue
showed that the resistin protein is abundant in adipocyte cytoplasm.
Steppan et al. (2001) found that a unique pattern of C-terminal
cysteines (X11-C-X8-C-X-C-X3-C-X10-C-X-C-X-C-X9-CC-X3-6-END) is
conserved in a family of resistin-like molecules, including at least 3
distinct mouse subtypes.

McTernan et al. (2002) found that resistin mRNA expression was similar
in both subcutaneous abdominal and omental fat depots. However, the
abdominal depots showed a 418% increase in resistin mRNA expression
compared with the thigh. The authors suggested that increased resistin
expression in abdominal fat could explain the increased risk of type II
diabetes associated with central obesity.

Degawa-Yamauchi et al. (2003) investigated the role of resistin in
obesity and insulin resistance by quantitating resistin protein by ELISA
in serum of 27 lean and 50 obese subjects. There was more serum resistin
protein in obese than lean subjects. The elevation of serum resistin in
obese humans was confirmed by Western blot as was expression of resistin
protein in human adipose tissue and isolated adipocytes. There was a
significant positive correlation between resistin and body mass index
(BMI). Multiple regression analysis with predictors BMI and resistin
explained 25% of the variance in the homeostasis model assessment of
insulin resistance score. BMI was a significant predictor of insulin
resistance (P = 0.0002), but resistin adjusted for BMI was not (P =
0.11). The authors concluded that their data demonstrate that resistin
protein is present in human adipose tissue and blood, and that there is
significantly more serum resistin in obese subjects, but it is not a
significant predictor of insulin resistance when adjusted for adiposity.

Verma et al. (2003) incubated endothelial cells with human recombinant
resistin and observed an increase in ET1 (EDN1; 131240) release and ET1
mRNA expression, with no change in nitric oxide production. Treatment
with resistin increased ET1 promoter activity via the activator
protein-1 (AP1; see 165160) site. Resistin upregulated adhesion
molecules and chemokines and downregulated tumor necrosis factor
receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3; 601896), an inhibitor of CD40
ligand (CD40LG; 300386) signaling. Verma et al. (2003) concluded that
these effects may represent the mechanistic link between resistin and
cardiovascular disease in the metabolic syndrome (see 605552).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2002) determined that the resistin gene comprises 4 exons,
the first of which is untranslated, and spans approximately 1,750 bp.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Patel et al. (2004) determined the crystal structure of resistin and
RELM-beta (605645), which revealed an unusual multimeric structure. Each
protomer comprises a carboxy-terminal disulfide-rich beta-sandwich
'head' domain and an amino-terminal alpha-helical 'tail' segment. The
alpha-helical segments associate to form 3-stranded coiled-coils, and
surface-exposed interchain disulfide linkages mediate the formation of
tail-to-tail hexamers. Analysis of serum samples showed that resistin
circulates in 2 distinct assembly states, likely corresponding to
hexamers and trimers. Infusion of a resistin mutant, lacking the
intertrimer disulfide bonds, in pancreatic insulin clamp studies
revealed substantially more potent effects on hepatic insulin
sensitivity than those observed with wildtype resistin.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cao and Hegele (2001) identified 2 noncoding single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RSTN gene useful for the study of diabetes,
obesity, or disorders of adipocyte biology such as lipodystrophy.

Pizzuti et al. (2002) searched for polymorphisms in the resistin gene by
SSCP and direct sequencing. They identified an ATG triplet repeat in the
3-prime-untranslated region and considered it for association with
insulin resistance. They identified 3 alleles: allele 1, with 8 repeats
and an allele frequency of 0.3%; allele 2, with 7 repeats and an allele
frequency of 94.5%; and allele 3, with 6 repeats and an allele frequency
of 5.2%. Allele 1 was not tested for association with insulin resistance
because of its very low allele frequency. Among Sicilians, subjects
carrying allele 3 had lower fasting insulin and insulin resistance
index, and lower glucose and insulin levels during the oral glucose
tolerance test. In subjects from Gargano (a region geographically close
to Sicily but with a different ethnicity), those carrying allele 3 had
lower fasting plasma glucose levels and serum triglycerides. When the 2
populations were analyzed together, subjects carrying allele 3 had lower
fasting insulin levels (P less than 0.005), homeostasis model assessment
of insulin resistance (P less than 0.005), and serum triglycerides (P =
0.01). The authors concluded that subjects carrying the 6-repeat allele
of the resistin gene are characterized by relatively high insulin
sensitivity.

Wang et al. (2002) hypothesized that genetic variation in the RSTN gene
might explain the heritability of insulin action in familial type II
diabetes kindreds. They screened 44 subjects with type II diabetes and
20 nondiabetic family members who were at the extremes of insulin
sensitivity. They identified 8 noncoding SNPs and 1 GAT microsatellite
repeat. Three SNPs, which were in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with
each other and had allelic frequencies exceeding 5%, were selected for
further study. No SNP was associated with type II diabetes, but the SNP
in the promoter region was a significant determinant of insulin
sensitivity index (P = 0.04) among nondiabetic family members who had
undergone intravenous glucose tolerance tests. The authors concluded
that the 3 common SNPs showed statistical significance as determinants
of insulin sensitivity index (P less than 0.01) in interaction with body
mass index.

Ma et al. (2002) sequenced the resistin gene in 32 subjects with type II
diabetes and identified 8 SNPs in the 5-prime flanking region and
introns of the gene. Allele and genotype distributions were determined
for all 8 SNPs in 312 cases with type II diabetes and in 303 nondiabetic
controls, all of Caucasian origin. No significant association with type
II diabetes was found at any of the polymorphic loci; however, an
interactive effect of one SNP, IVS2+181G-A, with obesity was a
significant determinant of type II diabetes risk in this population.

Insulin resistance is a major cause of type II diabetes mellitus.
Resistin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone, antagonizes insulin. Transgenic
mice that overexpress Retn in adipose tissue are insulin resistant
(Pravenec et al., 2003), whereas Retn-null mice show lower fasting blood
glucose (Banerjee et al., 2004), suggesting that the altered Retn
promoter function could cause diabetes. To determine the possible role
of RETN in human type II diabetes, Osawa et al. (2004) analyzed
polymorphisms in its 5-prime flanking region. They found that the GG
genotype at the -420C-G SNP was associated with type II diabetes with an
adjusted odds ratio of 1.97 and could accelerate the onset of diabetes
by 4.9 years. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that the GG
genotype itself was a primary variant in determining type II diabetes
susceptibility. Functionally, transcription factors Sp1 (189906) and Sp3
(601804) bound specifically to the susceptible DNA element that included
-420G. Overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 enhanced RETN promoter activity.
Consistent with these findings, fasting serum resistin levels were
higher in type II diabetes patients with the GG genotype. Osawa et al.
(2004) concluded that the specific recognition of -420G by Sp1/3
increases RETN promoter activity, leading to enhanced serum resistin
levels, thereby inducing human type II diabetes.

Mattevi et al. (2004) studied the association of the -420C-G SNP of the
RETN gene with obesity-related phenotypes in 585 nondiabetic Brazilians
of European descent. In the 356 women in the study, the G allele was
somewhat less frequent in the overweight/obese group than in normal
weight individuals (p = 0.040). Female carriers of the G allele had a
lower mean BMI and waist circumference than C/C homozygotes (p = 0.010).
When women were stratified by menopausal status, the association was
restricted to premenopausal women. Mattevi et al. (2004) suggested that
RETN gene variation has gender-specific effects on BMI.

MAPPING

Steppan et al. (2001) localized the human resistin gene to a cloned
fragment of human chromosome 19 (GenBank GENBANK AC008763).

ANIMAL MODEL

Rajala et al. (2003) found that an infusion of either resistin or RETNLB
in rats rapidly induced severe hepatic but not peripheral insulin
resistance. Increases in circulating resistin or RETNLB levels markedly
stimulated hepatic glucose production despite the presence of fixed
physiologic insulin levels. This enhanced rate of glucose output was due
to increased flux through glucose-6-phosphatase. The results supported
the notion that a novel family of fat- and gut-derived circulating
proteins modulates hepatic insulin action.

Banerjee et al. (2004) generated mice deficient in resistin by targeted
disruption. Resistin-null mice exhibited low blood glucose levels after
fasting due to reduced hepatic glucose production. This was partly
mediated by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (see 602739) and
decreased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver. Banerjee et
al. (2004) suggested that their data supported a physiologic function
for resistin in the maintenance of blood glucose during fasting.
Remarkably, lack of resistin diminished the increase in post-fast blood
glucose normally associated with increased weight, suggesting a role for
resistin in mediating hyperglycemia associated with obesity.

To determine whether resistin plays a causative role in the development
of diet-induced insulin resistance, Muse et al. (2004) lowered
circulating resistin levels in mice by use of a specific antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) directed against resistin mRNA and assessed
in vivo insulin action by the insulin clamp technique. After 3 weeks on
a high-fat diet, mice displayed severe insulin resistance associated
with an approximately 80% increase in plasma resistin levels. In
particular, the rate of endogenous glucose production increased more
than 2-fold compared with that in mice fed a standard chow. Treatment
with the resistin ASO for 1 week normalized the plasma resistin levels
and completely reversed the hepatic insulin resistance. Acute infusion
of purified recombinant mouse resistin in these mice, designed to
elevate acutely the levels of circulating resistin up to those observed
in the mice fed a high-fat diet, was sufficient to reconstitute hepatic
insulin resistance. These results provided strong support for the
physiologic role of resistin in the development of hepatic insulin
resistance.

RETN, +62G-A

Cao and Hegele (2001) identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
of the RETN gene, +62G-A, located 62 bp downstream of the last base of
the codon for termination in the 3-prime untranslated region of exon 4.

Tan et al. (2003) studied the association of the resistin gene +62G-A
polymorphism with type II diabetes (125853) in 1,102 Chinese type II
diabetes patients and 743 subjects without diabetes. Type II diabetes
subjects had a lower frequency of the A allele (GG:GA/AA, 83.5%:16.5%)
than did the controls (GG:GA/AA, 75.1%:24.9%; odds ratio, 1.524; 95% CI,
1.268-1.831; P less than 0.001). Unexpectedly, diabetic patients with
the GG genotype had a higher prevalence of hypertension (GG:GA/AA,
49.8%:36.2%; odds ratio, 1.375; 95% CI, 1.116-1.693; P = 0.001).
Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the +62G-A polymorphism acts
as an independent contributing factor to type II diabetes and
hypertension. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in
diabetic subjects with the GG genotype (144 +/- 21/87 +/- 13 mm Hg) were
significantly higher than those in subjects with GA/AA variants (139 +/-
21/84 +/- 14 mm Hg; P = 0.004 and P = 0.002, respectively). The authors
concluded that resistin may play a role in the pathogenesis of type II
diabetes and insulin resistance-related hypertension.

611982	TITLE *611982 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S18B; MRPS18B
;;MRPS18-2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS18B
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS18B, which they called MRPS18-2. The deduced
MRPS18B protein contains 258 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of 29.3 kD. Removal of a predicted 25-amino acid N-terminal
mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature 26.5-kD protein.
Koc et al. (2001) noted that 1 Mrps18 protein is present in E. coli,
whereas other organisms contain several Mrps18 orthologs. Humans have 3
MRPS18 proteins, MRPS18A (611981), MRPS18B, and MRPS18C (611983), that
share sequence conservation only in their central regions. Mouse and
human MRPS18B share 78.4% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPS18B gene to chromosome 6p21.3. They identified MRPS18B pseudogenes
on chromosomes 1 and 2.

604472	TITLE *604472 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13; TNFSF13
;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

605276	TITLE *605276 APOPTOSIS-ASSOCIATED TYROSINE KINASE; AATK
;;AATYK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly selecting cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Ishikawa et al. (1998) identified a full-length cDNA
clone, which they called KIAA0641, encoding a protein with significant
homology to the mouse Aatyk protein identified by Gaozza et al. (1997).
The deduced human AATK protein contains 1,207 amino acids and has an
observed molecular mass greater than 100 kD. By RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al.
(1998) detected expression of AATK in brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

From studies of the mouse Aatyk gene, Gaozza et al. (1997) hypothesized
that Aatyk is a necessary prerequisite for the induction of growth
arrest and/or apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells. They found that
expression of Aatyk is dramatically upregulated during apoptotic death
of 32D bone marrow-derived cells during IL3 (147740) deprivation as well
as during GCSF (138970)-induced terminal differentiation of 32D cells.
Additionally, the expression of Aatyk is blocked in v-abl or bcr-abl
transformed myeloid cells, which are unable to apoptose when deprived of
IL3.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the AATK
gene to chromosome 17. By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Seki et
al. (1999) refined the localization to 17q25.3

602352	TITLE *602352 GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE 2; GNRH2
DESCRIPTION Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1; 152760) is a decapeptide widely
known for its role in regulating reproduction by serving as a signal
from the hypothalamus to pituitary gonadotropes. This function for GNRH1
has been highly conserved during 500 million years of vertebrate
evolution despite the fact that its amino acid sequence varies by 50%.
In addition to the hypothalamic GNRH1 of variable sequence, many
vertebrate species express a second, invariant GNRH form, GNRH-II (or
GNRH2), with the primary structure
gln-his-trp-ser-his-gly-trp-tyr-pro-gly. Antibody staining demonstrates
GNRH2 in the midbrain of all species where its location has been
described (Kasten et al., 1996). Furthermore, nucleic acid probes have
been used to identify GNRH2 expression in the midbrain of several fish
species and one mammal. White et al. (1998) showed that a gene encoding
GNRH2 is expressed in humans and is located on chromosome 20p13,
distinct from the GNRH1 gene on 8p21-p11.2. The genomic and mRNA
structures of GNRH2 parallel those of GNRH1. However, in contrast to
GNRH1, GNRH2 is expressed at significantly higher levels outside the
brain (up to 30-fold), particularly in the kidney, bone marrow, and
prostate. The widespread expression of GNRH2 suggests it may have
multiple functions. Molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that GNRH2 is
likely the result of a duplication before the appearance of vertebrates,
and predicts the existence of a third GNRH form in humans and other
vertebrates. White et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization
to map GNRH2 to 20p13.

Chen et al. (2002) found that human normal and leukemic T cells produce
GNRH2 and GNRH1. Exposure of normal or cancerous human or mouse T cells
to GNRH2 or GNRH1 triggered de novo gene transcription and cell-surface
expression of the laminin receptor (150370), which is involved in
cellular adhesion and migration and in tumor invasion and metastasis.
GNRH2 or GNRH1 also induced adhesion to laminin and chemotaxis toward
SDF1A (600835), and augmented entry in vivo of metastatic T-lymphoma
into the spleen and bone marrow. Homing of normal T cells into specific
organs was reduced in mice lacking GNRH1. A specific GNRH1 receptor
antagonist blocked GNRH1 but not GNRH2-induced effects, which was
suggestive of signaling through distinct receptors. Chen et al. (2002)
suggested that GNRH2 and GNRH1, secreted from nerves or autocrine or
paracrine sources, interact directly with T cells and trigger gene
transcription, adhesion, chemotaxis, and homing to specific organs.

142810	TITLE *142810 HISTIDYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; HARS
;;HRS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HARS catalyzes the covalent ligation of histidine to its cognate tRNA as
an early step in protein biosynthesis (O'Hanlon and Miller, 2002).

CLONING

O'Hanlon et al. (1995) noted that HARS and HARS2 (600783), which they
called HO3, are oriented in a head-to-head configuration and share a
bidirectional promoter. They reported that the deduced 509-amino acid
HARS protein shares 72% amino acid identity with HARS2. Both proteins
contain 3 motifs conserved among class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and
2 signature regions of histidyl-tRNA synthetases. However, HARS and
HARS2 have divergent N-terminal domains that are encoded by the first 2
exons of each gene. HARS has a calculated molecular mass of 57.4 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb HARS transcript that was highly
expressed in heart, brain, liver, and kidney.

Using 5-prime RACE with a human kidney cDNA library, O'Hanlon and Miller
(2002) identified several HARS transcripts that differed only in the
lengths of their 5-prime UTRs. O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) noted that
pufferfish and human HARS proteins share 84% amino acid homology,
suggesting a high degree of conservation.

GENE STRUCTURE

O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) determined that the HARS gene contains 13
exons and spans approximately 17.4 kb. The HARS and HARS2 genes share a
bidirectional promoter that lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. Both genes use
multiple transcriptional start sites. HARS also uses a second, more
distal promoter that overlaps the first exons of the HARS2 gene.

MAPPING

Carlock et al. (1985) used a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with
mutations in 3 genes, HARS, RPS14 (130620) and CHR (118840), in
interspecies cell hybridization experiments, to assign the HARS gene to
chromosome 5. Wasmuth and Carlock (1986) assigned the HARS gene to
chromosome 5 by use of human-Chinese hamster ovary cell hybrids.

By genomic sequence analysis, O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) mapped the HARS
and HARS2 genes to chromosome 5q31.3. HARS and HARS2 exhibit a
head-to-head orientation, with 344 bp separating their ORFs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type III mapping to chromosome 5q (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the
HARS gene (Y454S; 142810.0001) that was not found in dbSNP 129 or the
1000 Genomes Project. In addition, an Old Order Amish patient from an
unrelated deme in Ontario, Canada, had an identical phenotype and was
homozygous for the same mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIB
HARS, TYR454SER

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type IIIB (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity for a 1361A-C transversion in the HARS gene,
resulting in a tyr454-to-ser (Y454S) substitution in the interface
between the catalytic domain and the anticodon binding domain. A patient
with an identical phenotype from an unrelated Old Order Amish deme in
Ontario, Canada, was also homozygous for the Y454S mutation. The variant
was not found in dbSNP 129 or the 1000 Genomes Project; it was, however,
detected in 7 of 406 Old Order Amish alleles, for a population-specific
allele frequency of 1.72%. (Puffenberger (2012) stated that the correct
population-specific allele frequency data appear in Table 4;
corresponding data in the text are incorrect.)

.0002
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HARS, ARG137GLN (dbSNP rs191391414)

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to a peripheral neuropathy has not been confirmed.

In a 64-year-old man with a 15-year history of impaired sensation in the
lower extremities and electrophysiologic studies suggestive of an axonal
peripheral neuropathy, Vester et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
410G-A transition (dbSNP rs191391414) in the HARS gene, resulting in an
arg137-to-gln (R137Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
catalytic core of the enzyme. The patient was ascertained from a larger
cohort of 363 individuals with peripheral neuropathy. The R137Q variant
was also found in 3 of over 13,000 control chromosomes. One of the
control carriers had no evidence of neuropathy at age 57 years.
Generation of a yeast strain with deletion of the Hst1 gene (the
ortholog of HARS) showed that the R137Q variant could not complement the
Hst1 deletion, suggesting that it is a loss-of-function allele.
Expression of the R137Q variant specifically in GABA motor nerves of C.
elegans caused gross morphologic defects in commissural axons, with
failure to reach the dorsal nerve cord, axonal beading, defasciculation,
and breaks in the nerve cord. The animals with the variant also showed
locomotor defects. Vester et al. (2013) concluded that the HARS R137Q
variant may be a pathogenic allele that predisposes to the development
of peripheral neuropathy, similar to other ARS mutations (see, e.g.,
GARS, 600287), but noted that a causal link remains unclear.

CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a developmental disorder
caused by haploinsufficiency of genes in 7q11.23. The deleted DNA
associated with WBS spans more than 1 Mb. Using an STS that maps close
to the common WBS centromeric deletion breakpoint, Meng et al. (1998)
isolated human testis cDNAs corresponding to a novel gene, FKBP6,
located within the WBS deletion region. The FKBP6 gene has 9 exons and
is oriented in a 5-prime to 3-prime direction from centromere to
telomere. FKBP6 is completely contained within a 35-kb cosmid; the DNA
corresponding to the insert of this cosmid was deleted in 40 of 40 WBS
individuals. The predicted 327-amino acid FKBP6 protein shows structural
homology to FKBP immunophilins, which are cellular receptors for the
immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin. FKBP6 contains an
N-terminal FK506-binding peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (rotamase) domain and
3 imperfect C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Northern
blot analysis detected an approximately 1.6-kb FKBP6 transcript in all
human tissues examined, with exceptionally high expression in testis and
high expression in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney.

Metcalfe et al. (2005) described a Bulgarian father and son with
Williams-Beuren syndrome who appeared to have a common heterozygous
deletion, confirming the expected dominant transmission and adding to
the few familial cases reported. The deletion included the FKBP6 gene
which has been shown to play a role in homologous chromosome pairing in
meiosis and male fertility in mouse models. Metcalfe et al. (2005)
suggested that haploinsufficiency for FKBP6 does not appear to preclude
male fertility in WBS, although male infertility involving this gene has
the potential to follow the mouse model as a human autosomal recessive
condition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Crackower et al. (2003) showed that Fkbp6 localizes to meiotic
chromosome cores and regions of homologous chromosome synapsis. Targeted
inactivation of Fkbp6 in mice resulted in aspermic males and the absence
of normal pachytene spermatocytes. Moreover, Crackower et al. (2003)
identified the deletion of Fkbp6 exon 8 as the causative mutation in
spontaneously sterile male 'aspermia' (as/as) mutant rats. Loss of Fkbp6
results in abnormal pairing and misalignments between homologous
chromosomes, nonhomologous partner switches, and autosynapsis of X
chromosome cores in meiotic spermatocytes. Fertility and meiosis are
normal in Fkbp6 mutant females. Thus, Crackower et al. (2003) concluded
that Fkbp6 is a component of the synaptonemal complex essential for
sex-specific fertility and for the fidelity of homologous chromosome
pairing in meiosis.
